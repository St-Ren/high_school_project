Images of Nature.
Natural scenes often become the themes of poetry.
Poets observe nature and present its beauty in their poems.
For example, poets may describe natural scenes such as a spring day, a windy day, or a snowy day.
Besides, poets often express their feelings about nature by creating vivid images in poems.
An image suggests a mental picture.
With an image, poets can describe the details of something vividly.
Readers, on the other hand, can relate their own sensory experiences to the images in the poem and thus can share the poets ideas.
Now lets read the poem Who Has Seen the Wind?
Who Has Seen the Wind?
by Christina Georgina Rossetti
Who has seen the wind?
Neither I nor you:
But when the leaves hang trembling
The wind is passing thro.
Who has seen the wind?
Neither you nor I:
But when the trees bow down their heads
The wind is passing by.
When we read the lines when the leaves hang trembling and when the trees bow down their heads, they remind us of a windy day.
The poet successfully creates an image of the wind by describing details of the scene.
These details help readers think of the moment when the wind passes by.
We might even bow our own heads, imagining that we are the trees.
The following poem is a stanza from William Blakes Night. Blake describes many details of a night scene in this poem.
by William Blake
The sun descending in the west,
The evening star does shine;
The birds are silent in their nest,
And I must seek for mine.
The moon, like a flower,
In heavens high bower,
With silent delight
Sits and smiles on the night.
People are already very familiar with what they can see at night, like stars or the moon.
However, Blake sees more than just the moon itself; he sees the moon as a flower, smiling at us from up in the sky.
Thus he is really comparing the moon to both a flower and a smiling person.
This unique image makes sense to us, and it somehow feels right.
Imagery seems to be an effective way of showing ones feelings in a poem.
We also do the same thing in ordinary conversation, as when we say, That horse was faster than the wind or Shes the apple of my eye. Such images can stir up readers (and listeners) senses.
When imagery is combined with rhyme and rhythm, we get poetry.
