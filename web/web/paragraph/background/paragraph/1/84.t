Unit 1  Lost in the New School.
Jack Wang is standing at the gate of his new school.
He is so nervous that his heart is pounding.
Today is his first day at an American high school.
Jack is from Taiwan, and his family just moved to the United States last month.
He is quite worried.
Can he communicate with his new classmates?
Will he make new friends?
Jack plucks up the courage to walk into the school.
On the hall walls, he sees many sports medals and pictures of students who are wearing costumes and playing different roles in dramas.
Where should I go Jack wonders.
I am lost already. The students that walk past him are chatting happily, so he doesnt ask any of them for help.
Then, a woman walks over to Jack.
Good morning, she says.
I am the principal, Ms. Smith.
Can I help you?
Yes, says Jack.
My name is Jack Wang.
I am a new student here.
Nice to meet you, Jack, she says.
Please come with me.
They go into her office.
Here, she says and gives him a piece of paper.
This is your class schedule.
There are two important numbers on your schedule.
The first is 104.
That is the number of your homeroom, Ms. Smith continues.
It is the classroom which you have to go to at the beginning of your school day.
After that, you will need to go to different classrooms for different classes.
Dont forget to check your class schedule carefully.
The second number is 78, your locker number.
Your locker is next to your homeroom.
You can store your books and personal belongings inside.
Jack thanks Ms. Smith and goes to his locker.
An Asian boy is standing next to it.
Hi, says the boy.
My locker is next to yours.
I know you are new here because you look a bit confused and lost, Ken says.
The first day at a new school is always difficult.
Do you want to meet me in the cafeteria for lunch?
Suddenly Jack feels better.
Ken seems to be such a nice guy that Jack gives him a big smile.
Sounds great, Jack says.
How did you know that I needed help?
Was it that obvious?
Ken laughs and replies, Last year, I was a new student as well, so I can totally understand your feelings.
By the way, would you like to play basketball with me after school?
You can make some friends on the basketball court.
I love basketball, but I can only stay for a short while, Jack answers.
I have to head back home for dinner, or my mom will .
Sorry to interrupt you, but youd better check out your class schedule again.
Classes end at half past two.
We will have plenty of time before dinner, Ken reminds Jack.
Jack is surprised to find that there are so many differences between the schools in Taiwan and the schools in the U.S.A., but he still has high hopes of fitting in soon in the future.
