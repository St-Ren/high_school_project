One day during the Vietnam War, a bomb dropped in the yard of an orphanage.
The explosion killed several children, and wounded several others.
Soon an American doctor arrived with a nurse, and they began to perform first aid on the wounded kids.
However, one little girl had already bled too much, and she needed a blood transfusion as soon as possible.
The doctor asked the other children to donate blood to the dying girl, for she hadn't brought enough bags of blood.
First, the doctor gave everyone a blood test and found five children with the right blood type.
However, the doctor and the nurse could not speak much Vietnamese, while the orphanage workers and kids could not speak English.
With the help of gestures, the doctor told the children, "Your friend is bleeding badly.
She needs your blood!"
The kids nodded their heads and seemed to understand.
But then one began to look very nervous, another started to cry, and still another closed her eyes and shook her head.
No one raised a hand to volunteer.
The doctor was surprised.
Why wouldn't they give some blood to save their friend?
Didn't they understand what she had said?
At last, one of the kids slowly raised his hand and then backed out quickly.
But a moment later, he raised his hand again, and this time he didn't put it down.
The doctor breathed a sigh of relief and made the little boy lie on the makeshift examination table.
As the needle penetrated his skin and began to draw blood out of his skinny arm, the boy lay there stiff with tears rolling down his cheeks.
The doctor asked if he was in pain.
He shook his head but didn't stop crying.
The doctor was confused.
She felt that something had gone wrong, though she didn't know what.
But she was certain that the problem was not the needle.
Just when the doctor began to panic, a Vietnamese nurse arrived on the scene.
The doctor told her about the situation.
The nurse bent over and whispered something in the boy's ear, and soon he stopped crying.
He even began to smile!
It turned out that all the children had misunderstood the doctor.
They thought she would drain them of all their blood to save the little girl.
The doctor finally understood why nobody except this boy was willing to give blood, and why he was weeping.
But now she wondered why he was willing to give blood even when he thought he would surely die.
The Vietnamese nurse asked the boy the question.
This time he responded without hesitation.
He said, "Because she is my best friend."
