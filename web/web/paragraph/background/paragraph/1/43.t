The Courageous Manager.
Cindy was a very powerful woman who owned several companies and made millions of dollars a year.
One day she threw a party at her house for the managers of all her companies.
When the executives arrived, they couldnt believe their eyesXCindy lived in a mansion.
Cindy welcomed everybody with a smile.
She offered to take them all on a tour of her luxurious mansion and the surrounding property.
Every room was as beautiful as it could be, but the really interesting part was outside.
Behind the house was a large swimming pool.
Look! someone gasped.
The huge pool was filled with hungry alligators.
Cindy looked at her managers and said, I brought you all out here for a reason.
I think executives should be measured by their courage.
Courage is what made me into the successful person you see before you today.
So this is my challenge for each of you.
If anyone here has enough courage to dive into this pool, swim through those alligators, and make it to the other side, I will give that person anything he wishes.
Even if he wants my money, my companies, or my beautiful house, I will give it to him.
Everyone laughed at Cindys ridiculous offer.
No one took her seriously.
As they turned to go back into the house, there was a loud splash.
Everyone turned and looked at the pool.
The youngest manager was in the pool, swimming for his life.
As the alligators swam toward him, he dodged them left and right.
After several minutes, he made it to the edge of the pool.
He pulled himself out just as a huge alligator snapped at his shoe.
He then dropped onto a chair, panting.
Cindy was astonished.
She held out a towel for the young man, You are amazing.
Ive never seen anything like that before.
You are brave beyond measure and I will be true to my word.
Just say the word and Ill make all your wishes come true. The young man looked up at Cindy and said, Yes, I do have a wish.
I want you to tell me who pushed me into the pool!
