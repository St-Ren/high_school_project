In the traditional story, Santa Claus had only eight reindeer.
They lived with Santa at the North Pole and pulled Santa's sleigh every Christmas Eve.
On his sleigh, Santa would deliver Christmas toys to all the good boys and girls who believed in him.
Then, in the 1s, an American department store was looking for a way to sell more goods at Christmas time.
One of its employees created a character to add to the story.
The new character was a reindeer with a bright red nose.
He was given the name Rudolph.
In the story, Rudolph found himself not fully accepted by the other reindeer.
In fact, they looked down on him because of his big red nose.
They told jokes about his strange appearance and wouldn't even let him join in their games.
One Christmas Eve at the North Pole, the weather was very dark and stormy.
Santa had no one to guide his sleigh on his trip around the world.
All at once, Santa thought of Rudolph and his bright, shiny nose, and asked Rudolph to lead the way.
Rudolph did a good job and, as a result, Santa was able to deliver his gifts on time.
Children woke up on Christmas morning and found their stockings filled with candy and toys.
That is the story of Rudolph made up by the department store employee.
But Rudolph did not become really well-known until the story was turned into a song, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."
Today, the song lives on in the hearts of people all around the world.
It carries the message of love and tolerance.
For many, that is the true meaning of Christmas.
And the following are the words of the song:
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say:
"Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee:
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
You'll go down in history."
