As a modern citizen, you will surely want to learn more about the world.
You can do so by learning a foreign language or traveling to the country of your dreams for a short stay.
You may also watch such TV programs as those on the Discovery Channel.
But there is something you really can't miss-the various foods on the menu!
Yes, food!
Food can be a very good tour guide.
It not only pleases your mouth and tongue, but also reflects the climate and geography of a place.
Take Thailand for example.
It is a warm tropical country, and most people there like sour and spicy food.
In the mountains, there are plenty of bugs and worms.
People there have the grasshoppers and scorpions roasted, fried, and spiced.
They also put red ant eggs on toast and in a Thai salad.
These foods may look weird to others.
To the local people, however, they are very tasty, low in fat, and rich in protein.
Up north in Alaska, there are not so many bugs but there are plenty of fish.
People there leave salmon heads and guts in the ground for weeks, and then have them made into a tasty dish when they become rotten.
Jellied moose noses and bear stews are also commonly seen on the tables of Eskimos.
These dishes may make other people wrinkle up their noses.
However, they show how Eskimos live on the things that are available in a world of ice and snow.
So, next time you are served unfamiliar food, don't wrinkle up your nose.
Instead, dig in or at least sample some of it.
The unusual dishes on the menu can be a lovely window on the world that is weird but wonderful!
