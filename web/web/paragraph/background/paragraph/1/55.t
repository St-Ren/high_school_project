Things I Learned from Dad.
During the process of growing up, many people influence our lives: our teachers, our classmates and friends, our brothers and sisters.
But perhaps most of all, it is our parents who have the greatest effect on us.
Influenced by their example, we learn how to behave and how to live in this world.
As we get older, we realize more fully just how important our parents have been in shaping our lives.
Below this two stories, from Great Dads, which show how two successful people, Rebecca Lobo and Richard Branson, have been influenced by their fathers.
Be Loving.
I knew---even when I was very young----just how much my mom and dad loved each other.
Whenever one of them went out, they kissed each other goodbye.
My brother, sister and I thought this was gross!
But when I get married, I can only hope that I will have found someone who loves me as much as Dad loves Mom.
Because there was always so much love in the family, I grew up with an incredible security blanket.
Mom battled breast cancer when I was in college.
Despite his worry, Dad was a pillar of strength for us and especially for her.
After her mastectomy, she decided against the added trauma of breast-reconstruction surgery.
Mom told me that in their entire marriage Dad never even suggested that she change her hairstyle.
Instead, he has always told her how beautiful she is.
And thats why she thinks fighting cancer wasnt as hard as it could have been.
She knew that no matter what, Dad and his love would be there.
Even now, when my mom goes away for a couple of days, Dad has a hard time with it.
I think its because it makes him think about what life would be like without her.
I dont know who said it originally, but Mom has passed it along---the most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother.
My dad is a perfect example of that.

Encourage.
My sisters and I grew up in a little village in England.
Our father was a struggling lawyer, but I always knew he was special.
He never criticized, but used praise to bring out our best.
Hed say, If you pour water on flowers, they flourish.
If you dont give them water, they die.
I remember as a child I said something unkind about somebody, and my father said, Any time you say something unpleasant about somebody else, its a reflection of you. He explained that if I looked for the best in people, I would get the best in return.
Ive tried to follow this principle in running my company.
Dad has also always been very understanding.
At 15, I started a magazine.
It was taking up a great deal of my time, and the headmaster of my school gave me a choice: stay in school or leave to work on my magazine.
I decided to leave, and Dad tried to sway me from my decision, as any good father would.
When he realized I had made up my mind, he said, Richard, when I was 23, my dad persuaded me to go into law.
And Ive always regretted it.
I wanted to be an archeologist, but I didnt pursue my dream.
You know what you want.
Go fulfill that dream.
As it turned out, my little magazine went on to become Student, a national magazine for young people in the U.K. My wife and I have two children, and Id like to think we are bringing them up in the same way Dad raised me.
