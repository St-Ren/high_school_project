Have you ever felt down because of the pressure at school?
Are you worried about your poor interpersonal relationships?
As a matter of fact, millions of people are suffering from a kind of light depression, often called the blues.
When that happens, sufferers may experience times of very low energy.
No matter what causes you to feel blue, you had better find a way to beat
the blues and keep on going.
Exercise, for example, is a great start.
Physical activities cause the body to release endorphins, which produce a feeling of well-being.
Endorphins raise your spirits in the short run.
Good health and the feeling of accomplishment that come with regular exercise do so in the long run.
To get the positive effects of exercise, you don't need to run a marathon.
Just keep your body moving with twenty minutes of jogging, bicycling, or brisk walking three to four times a week.
Some doctors also believe that there is a connection between food and mood.
To put it simply, what you eat can affect how you feel.
If you consume too much junk food, then you may end up feeling down in the dumps.
If you drink too much tea or coffee, the caffeine may provide an immediate boost of energy.
However, it may also keep you from getting a good night's sleep, making you feel even worse later on.
Fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, will always do you good and make you feel better.
There are some other ways to lighten your mood and they cost nothing.
For example, you can take a few deep breaths.
Controlled breathing can lower your blood pressure and raise your energy level.
Getting proper amounts of sunlight also helps a lot when you are moody.
Besides, being a volunteer will make you happy because you know you are still strong enough to help so many people in need.
You can also make a list of all the good things in life.
By doing so, you will appreciate your life more.
While the list of things you can do to beat the blues could go on and on, one important point is that you have to adopt an active lifestyle rather than react to events passively.
After all, it's you who have to be responsible for your own happiness!
