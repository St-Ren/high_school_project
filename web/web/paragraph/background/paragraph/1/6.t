Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.
Isn't this a song?
Yes, but it is also a poem.
We can also call it a nursery rhyme, a kind of short poem or song that is written for children.
Nursery rhymes are easily remembered, even by young children.
This is not only because they are short but also because they rhyme.
Rhyming is the magic that makes poems and songs so pleasant to the ear.
And because we enjoy their sounds, we learn to read them easily.
Writing rhymes is a kind of wordplay.
It is not only a job for poets; in fact, it is a game for everyone.
And if you want to try it by yourself, you are encouraged to read more poems first.
When you read them, remember to pay special attention to the rhyming words.
Here is another one for you to enjoy.
I Heard a Bird Sing
I heard a bird sing
In the dark of December
A magical thing
And sweet to remember.
"We are nearer to Spring
Than we were in September,"
I heard a bird sing
In the dark of December.
Did you enjoy listening for the rhyming words?
And did you notice their pattern?
Unlike "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star," this poem rhymes in every other line.
However, don't forget to read the poem as a whole in order to appreciate its beauty.
With a few simple words, the poet creates a beautiful picture.
Just imagine this: on a cold winter night, a bird is singing a sweet melody to tell everyone that spring is coming.
And this good news is just like magic.
It not only brightens up the world but also warms people's hearts on such a dark and chilly night.
Poetry is beautiful.
With rhymes, it is more fun.
