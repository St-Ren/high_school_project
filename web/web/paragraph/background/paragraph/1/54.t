Healthy Again.
Mr. Cho was worried when he saw that something was wrong with his goldfish.
They had red patches on their skin, they werent eating, and they didnt have much energy.
It seemed they had some sort of infection, and Mr. Cho was afraid they wouldnt last long.
He decided, however, that he would not take the fish to the veterinarian.
Instead, he would try his own cure:  acupuncture.
He stuck long, thin needles into the backs of the fishes, and he left them there for several minutes.
He repeated the treatment several times over the next few days.
Soon the fish appeared to be feeling much better.
Mr. Cho was relieved when he saw them swimming around energetically and beginning to eat again.
The red patches also disappeared.
Did the fish get better because of the acupuncture treatments?
Mr. Cho, who himself is a professional acupuncturist, thinks they did.
Although acupuncture for goldfish is uncommon, acupuncture for people is very common in some East Asian countries, where acupuncturists like Mr. Cho help many people to overcome a wide range of medical problems, including infections, backaches, and stomachaches.
They sometimes even use acupuncture during operations to prevent patients from feeling any pain.
To see what happens during an acupuncture treatment, we can take Ming Wang as an example.
Ming, a man who suffers from chronic headaches, decided to go to Dr. Han, an acupuncturist.
Heres what happened at Dr. Hans office.
First, Dr. Han examined Ming and asked him about his headaches.
Then, the doctor began to insert the one-inch-long acupuncture needles.
Ming was surprised to find that Dr. Han inserted the needles in his neck and foot, instead of in his head.
The doctor explained that the needles were not inserted in the place where the patient felt pain, but in special points corresponding to the bodys flow of energy.
As Dr. Han pressed the needles into Mings skin, Ming was surprised again.
He felt a slight pinch when each needle went in, but otherwise, he found it didnt hurt at all.
Acupuncture has helped millions of people like Ming, not only in Asia, but throughout the world.
Many, many people testify that acupuncture really works.
But how does it work?
One explanation, thousands of years old, was given by the ancient ChineseXthe first to use acupuncture.
They believed that energy flowed through the human body along certain paths.
They thought that too much or too little energy flowing to one part of the body would cause pain or sickness.
They discovered, however, that there were several hundred places on the body where an acupuncturist could change the flow of energy.
These places were called acupuncture points.
A needle inserted into an acupuncture point on a patients leg, for example, would change the flow of energy to the patients stomach.
When the energy flowed correctly again, the patient would feel better.
There is also a modern explanation of how acupuncture works.
Scientists point out that the acupuncture points have many more nerve endings than other places on the skin.
Nerve endings receive pain messages when someone is sick or hurt.
The pain messages then travel through the nerves.
Perhaps the acupuncture needles also send messages through the nerves, but these messages interrupt the pain messages before they reach the brain.
As a result, the patient feels better.
People who have been helped by acupuncture probably dont care which explanation is correct.
They are just happy to be like Mr. Chos goldfishXhealthy again.
