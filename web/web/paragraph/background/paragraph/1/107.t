Unit 9  The Warmer It Gets, the Worse Things Become.
The animated film Farewell, created by the Taiwanese artist Chu-Ling Hsu, won a Special Mention at the AniFest in 2009.
This short film portrayed the very last polar bear on Earth saying farewell from a melting iceberg before drowning.
Hsu made this film to warn that global warming had already become quite serious, hoping that her film could help focus public attention on environmental protection.
Just as this animated film shows, polar bears are at risk of becoming extinct.
They have not only been over-hunted and badly affected by water and air pollution, but also been threatened by global warming.
Because of global warming, large amounts of Arctic ice are melting away, and the seal population is falling sharply.
Polar bears, which live on seals, are thus rapidly decreasing in number since they have fewer places to live in and are often unable to find enough food to eat.
After learning of this, you might wonder whether human beings will become victims of global warming as well.
In fact, this is the case.
This fatal warming is caused by the huge amounts of carbon dioxide discharged into the atmosphere by the burning of fuels.
The carbon dioxide absorbs the suns heat and keeps it from escaping back into space, and thus causes the earth to warm.
As the planet has warmed up, ice in the polar regions has begun to melt, which results in rising sea levels worldwide.
Small islands and low coastal areas could soon be underwater, and the residents of major cities such as London, Shanghai, and Taipei are likely to have nowhere to live by the end of the 21st century.
Global warming can also lead to severe climate change, and this may cause the deaths of hundreds of people at a time.
Many readers probably still remember how in 2012 Hurricane Sandy took the lives of more than 200 people in the American continents and caused damage to property estimated at over US$68 billion.
And now, more and more land that used to be fertile has become barren, since the deserts near the equator are expanding.
Because of such negative effects of global warming, human beings might also face starvation before long, just as many polar bears have already experienced.
When polar bears are starving due to a lack of food, they are likely to kill and eat one another.
Imagine such a horrible scene and ask yourself if you can bear to let this happen.
If we want to save our furry friends, both the people and the governments of the world should take immediate action to deal with this issue before it is too late.
We need to seize every opportunity to slow global warming, or food shortages will be just one of the terrible tragedies that we will experience in the near future.
By then, it might just be our turn to say farewell to the planet.
