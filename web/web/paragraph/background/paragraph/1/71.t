Lunar New Year is the most spectacular festival for Chinese communities around the world.
It is an occasion for people to be away from work and get together with family and friends.
Lunar New Year is celebrated in several countries in Asia such as Tibet, Mongolia, Korea, China, Vietnam, and of course Taiwan.
Owing to their historical connection to China, no matter which calendar is followed, these countries celebrate the arrival of spring with shared traditions and special events.
The holiday lasts for a few
days, as in Korea and Taiwan, and up to two or more weeks, as in Tibet and Vietnam.
The origin of the Lunar New Year
Festival can be traced back to thousands
of years ago.
One of the most famous
traditions is about Nian.
Nian is believed to be
a terrible beast that came out to eat people on
New Year's Eve.
To frighten Nian away, red-paper
couplets are put on doors, lanterns are lit, and firecrackers are set off all night.
Early the next morning and throughout the festival, people say gong xi or "congratulations" to each other for getting through the night safely.
Another important tradition takes place on Lunar New Year's Eve when families get together for a big dinner.
Hong bao is given out and everyone tries to stay up all night to welcome the New Year.
Some families perform traditional religious rites after midnight to welcome the God of the New Year.
The rites are then followed by a storm of firecrackers.
Some say that the Lunar New Year's magic has worn off in Taiwan because of the island's modernization, but the festival is still the most important one of the year.
Therefore, even though the official holiday lasts just a few days and many people spend much time in traffic jams, at busy airports, and on full trains and buses, they are still excited to get home in time for the most important family dinner of the year.
Indeed, no matter  what changes may occur in the future, the connection to family will always lie at the heart of Lunar New Year celebrations.
