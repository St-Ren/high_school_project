When my son Joey was born, his feet were twisted upward with the bottoms resting on his tummy.
It meant that Joey had been born with club feet.
The doctors assured us that with treatment he would be able to walk normally, but would probably never run very well.
If he walked great distances, like at the amusement parks, he complained that his legs were tired and that they hurt.
We would stop walking, take a break, and talk about what we had seen.
We did not tell him why his legs hurt and why they were weak.
We did not tell him this was expected because his body had a problem ever since he was born.
We did not tell him, so he did not know.
The children in our neighborhood ran around as most children do during play.
Joey would jump right in and run and play, too.
We never told him that he probably would not be able to run as well as the other children.
We did not tell him he was different.
So he did not know.
In seventh grade, he decided to go out for the cross-country team.
Every day he trained with the team.
He seemed to work harder.
Perhaps he sensed that the abilities that seemed to come naturally to so many others did not come naturally to him.
We did not tell him that he should not expect to make the team.
The runners chosen for the team were the top seven runners of the school.
We did not tell him, so he did not know.
I will never forget the time he had a 39-degree Celsius fever.
He would not stay home because he had cross-country practice.
I worried about him all day.
I expected to get a call from the school asking me to come get him and take him home.
No one called.
I went out to the training area after school.
I thought that if I were there, he might decide to skip practice that evening.
I pulled up alongside him and drove slowly to keep pace with him as he ran.
I asked how he felt.
Okay, he said.
As the sweat rolled down his face, his eyes were glassy from his fever.
Yet he looked straight ahead and kept running.
We never told him he could not run four miles with a 39-degree Celsius fever.
So he did not know.
Two weeks later, the names of the runners picked for the team were called.
Joey was number six on the list.
He was in seventh grade.
The other six team members were all eighth graders.
We never told him he probably should not expect to make the team.
We never told him he could not do it.
So he did not know.
He just did it.
