Unit 10  Why Do We Lie?
When we were kids, we were taught the virtue of honesty through fairy tales and stories.
The story of Pinocchio showed us the importance of telling the truth.
The boy who cried wolf finally lost all his sheep as well as the trust of his fellow villagers.
From these stories, we understand that Honesty is the best policy, but many of us still lie.
We sometimes lie in order to cover up our mistakes.
While it is true that we make errors from time to time, some of us dont have the courage to admit that weve made them.
For example, some students might deceive their teacher about unfinished homework.
They might say that they left it at home when in fact, they didnt even do it.
These students didnt want to seem irresponsible, so they made up an excuseXthat is, a lieXto save face.
Another reason we lie is to get out of situations that we dont want to be involved in or cannot manage.
If we would rather sleep in on the weekend than go camping with our family, we might give this excuse: I have stayed up late recently to finish a company project, so I need to get some rest. This type of lie is also told by students quite often.
For instance, a boy who has been caught cheating on a test might not reveal what has happened to his family.
This student may decide not to tell the truth because he isnt confident enough to deal with the anger that he might face.
When we dont want to face consequences, lies are convenient ways to avoid difficulties.
In contrast, sometimes we tell white lies in order not to hurt other peoples feelings.
If a good friend gets a terrible new haircut, we are likely to lie and say, I like your new haircut.
It looks good on you, to spare his or her feelings.
This type of lie is generally not considered bad or wrong.
Many people tell white lies instead of the truth for the purpose of preventing negative reactions.
Therefore, white lies can sometimes be useful in maintaining good relationships.
Similarly, we tell protective lies so as to keep ourselves out of dangerous situations.
Parents may teach their children to use this type of lie in certain circumstances.
Some parents, for example, ask their children to say that Mom and Dad are too busy to come to the phone if a stranger calls while they are out.
In this situation, protective lies may keep people safe from harm.
It is clear that people lie for many reasons, both good and bad.
However, it is not always easy to determine which specific reason to give for a lie.
Before we lie, perhaps we should rethink our motives.
We never know when our lies might be exposed and cause us embarrassment or the loss of peoples trust.
