Mrs.
Summon's child, Billy, was dying because he had been plagued by leukemia.
As she watched him, her heart was filled with sadness.
Like any parent, she had wanted her son to grow up and fulfill all his dreams.
Now, that was no longer possible.
But she still had hope in her heart.
She took her son's hand and asked, "Billy, do you still dream of being a fireman when you grow up?"
Billy replied, "Yes, I'm always dreaming of that."
Later that day, Mrs. Summon went to the local fire department, where she met Fire Chief Bob Rosen.
She told him about her son and asked if he might be able to give him a ride around the block on a fire engine.
The chief said, "We can do better than that.
We can make him an honorary fireman for the whole day.
And if you give me his size, we can even make him a real fireman's uniform!"
Three days later the chief came to pick up Billy.
He dressed Billy in his own little uniform, and escorted him from the hospital to a hook-and-ladder truck.
Billy sat in the front of the truck and helped steer it back to the fire station.
Later, he went out with the crew on three calls.
He rode in different fire engines, the ambulance, and even the fire chief's car.
He was also videotaped and appeared on the local news that night.
After his dream came true, Billy seemed to get stronger.
He lived three months longer than the doctors had predicted.
Then one night his vital signs began to drop, and the nurses called Billy's family to the hospital.
One nurse called the fire chief.
She asked if a fireman in uniform could come to the hospital to be with Billy.
The chief replied, "We can do better than that.
We'll be there in five minutes.
But when you hear the sirens screaming and see the lights flashing, please announce that there is no fire.
It's just the fire department coming to see one of its finest members."
About five minutes later, a fire truck arrived at the hospital and extended its ladder up to Billy's window.
Sixteen firefighters climbed into the room, and each gave the boy a hug.
Billy looked up at the fire chief and asked, "Chief, am I really a fireman now?"
"Billy, you are," the chief said.
With those words, Billy smiled and closed his eyes one last time.
