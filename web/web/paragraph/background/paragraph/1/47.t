Do You Believe in Ghosts?
Do you believe in ghosts?
When people die, do you think their spirits will go to heaven or hell?
It is said that after people die, their spirits often hang around on earth for a while.
While they are hanging around with nothing better to do, they may do some evil things.
To avoid this kind of trouble, many cultures have special ways of dealing with these lost spirits.
The midsummer Chinese Ghost Festival was originally a Buddhist holy day.
According to an old story, Mulian, a religious Buddhist with special powers, saw his dead mothers spirit suffering in hell.
He kept sending his mother food to relieve her pain.
However, the food would burn up in the flames before she could eat it.
He prayed to Buddha, and he was told  to prepare a feast for all the good spirits still on earth on the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month.
In this way, he not only helped the spirits enter paradise, but also released his mother from her pain.
Now on July 15, people in Taiwan place food outside and burn paper money for the ghosts.
Thousands of years ago, people in Ireland believed that on the night of October 31, the souls of those who had recently died would come back.
What they wanted to do was take over the bodies of the living.
In order to frighten these lonely ghosts away, people dressed up in horrible costumes.
They walked noisily around the neighborhood, dancing and shouting at the top of their lungs.
Today, October 31 is known as Halloween, and  many kids in the West still dress up as ghosts, mummies, witches, and vampires on that day.
They hope that by scaring away the evil spirits, the good spirits may come out on the following day, All Saints Day.
It seems that different cultures have similar ideas about ghosts, and about how to deal with them, but the actual festivals may vary.
Just like the living, some ghosts are friendly and some are lonely.
Maybe the so-called evil ghosts are just lonely.
Why not be nice the next time you meet a lost soul?
