The moment I arrived in Lijiang, a big waterwheel, the town's landmark, came into view.
It indicated the important role of water in the people's everyday lives.
The water came from melted snow in the nearby mountains and turned into countless streams that flowed through the town.
These streams formed a well-rounded canal system that supplied water for the people's daily needs.
On some streets, I found wells with a unique design.
The so-called "three-eyed" well was made up of three linked pools.
Each pool was at a different level.
In the early morning, I saw a child take drinking water from the first and highest pool.
Then his older sister washed food in the second pool.
His mother washed clothes in the last and lowest pool.
Each pool had a different purpose, and the water was used again and again at different levels.
It was not wasted.
Another admirable design of water use was their "street cleaning" system.
The marketplace was built on a slope.
A canal flowed along the west and the higher side of the slope.
When a day's trade was done, the ground of the square was dirty.
The people closed a water gate on the canal to let water flow over the streets.
Everyone picked up a brush and took part in the cleaning.
The dirty water then flowed into a lower canal, a ditch, on the other side of the square.
From there, it was directed out of town to water the nearby farms.
I also got a brush and joined this "street washing carnival."
I saw smiles on the faces of the people.
The Lijiang people were happy with the way they lived.
They cherished water as a gift from heaven.
They made the best use of this resource so that they could live in harmony with nature.
