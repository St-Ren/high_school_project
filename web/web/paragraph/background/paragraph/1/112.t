What did your parents do to celebrate when you were born?
Of course you cant remember, but maybe they have photos from a ceremony of some kind.
People usually have ceremonies to mark important events in life.
For example, there are wedding ceremonies.
Getting married is an important event, and having a baby is, too.
In most cultures, there are ceremonies and other traditional ways to celebrate a new child in the family.
In the United States, the proud parents of a new baby often decorate their front door.
Its an exciting time for them, and they want to share the good news with their neighbors.
For example, they may put balloons on their door.
Pink balloons mean the baby is a girl.
Blue ones are for boys.
New fathers used to hand out cigars to all their friends.
Today, that tradition continues, but things are a little different.
Only about 25% of American adults smoke, so the cigars are sometimes made of chocolate.
People around the world often celebrate a new baby with some type of ceremony, perhaps a religious ceremony.
This may take place when a baby is a few days or weeks old.
In Korea, theres a traditional ceremony on the babys 100th day.
In Mexico, many new parents dress their babies in special clothes and take them to church.
In some African cultures, the family plants a tree.
New babies in every culture have one thing in common: they all need names.
Sometimes the parents choose their babys name before the child is born.
However, a babys name is not always the parents decision.
Sometimes the name depends on family traditions, and some babies get their names at religious ceremonies.
Parents in the United States sometimes put the news about their baby in the newspaper.
For example:
Smith, Michael James, Jr. Born July 4, son of Michael J. and Sarah Dean Smith of Deerfield .
This baby has the same name as his father.
Michael is a very common American name.
Some American parents want unusual names for their children.
Apple Kaufmann has a very uncommon  first name.
She says, My parents let my eight-year-old brother name me!
The parents of new babies often receive presents.
In the United States, friends send them cards, flowers, and baby clothes.
Presents, celebrations -these things are great.
But what do most new parents really need?
More sleep!
