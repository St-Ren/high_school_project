Can Dogs Talk?
Can you understand your dog?
Can your dog understand you?
Some people say the answer is yes to both questions.
In Germany, researchers studied a dog that could understand more than 200 words.
In Tokyo, a company invented a device called the Bow-Lingual.
This device can translate a dogs bark into words.
The Bow-Lingual is becoming very popular.
In fact, now you can get one in different languages all over the world!
Rico, a nine-year-old dog in Germany, knew the names of over 200 toys.
In an experiment, the researchers put a new toy together with seven of Ricos old toys in a room.
Then they told Rico to get the new toy, calling that toy by its new name.
Rico understood the order and finished the task 7 out of 10 times.
One month later, they did the experiment again, and Rico still remembered the name of the new toy.
Thus, according to the researchers, a dog can hear and learn new words just like a child.
Dogs can listen to and understand their owners, but can their owners understand them?
The Bow-Lingual Dog Translator may be able to help.
The Bow-Lingual is a small device with a microphone.
You can attach the microphone to your dogs collar.
When your dog barks, the Bow-Lingual records the sound.
Then it translates the sound into six emotions: happy, sad, watchful, frustrated, needy, and confident.
After it translates the sound into an emotion, it matches the emotion with common phrases which fit your dogs emotional state.
These include This bone is delicious, I feel great, and Lets go, etc.
This device helps everyone understand dogs.
Understanding dogs language is a great help in knowing what is wrong with a dog if he has a health problem, and also in dog training.
With the help of the Bow-Lingual Translator, Dr. Dolittles dream of talking with animals is no longer a fantasy.
As long as there is a need for pet-owner communication, there will probably be more new inventions.
The Bow-Lingual is so popular that soon there may be one for cats, too.
Of course, it will be the Meow-Lingual.
