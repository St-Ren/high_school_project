Earth Ride: Water on Earth.
Welcome to the earth ride!
Get ready for a roller-coaster ride around the only planet in the solar system that has life.
On earth, every form of life depends on one thing VV water.
Water covers 70 percent of the earths surface.
But once upon a time, there was none.
How did water first appear on earth?
To answer this, the earth ride will take us back to a period when the world was very young.
Frozen water came to the earth in comets.
Its amazing to realize that every creature on the planet is partly from outer space!
Also, some water that was inside the planet became very hot and was pushed to the surface.
After the earth cooled down, water vapor in the atmosphere held the suns heat and kept the planet warm.
Because of this greenhouse effect, life began.
Over time, much of the water rained back down.
It created oceans and started the water cycle we have today.
The water on the planet is used and recycled by all living things.
The rain that falls today is the same rain that fell when dinosaurs walked the earth.
On the earth ride we can follow water droplets and enter a tree.
Plants are the foundation of the food chain.
Without water they cant grow.
Its just a short ride for a water droplet to travel from a leaf to other forms of life, such as a monkey.
Water is also important for animals.
A camel can drink 120 liters at one time.
Humans should drink at least two liters of water every day.
Since it started out as ice from outer space, this water has traveled a long way to get to our bodies!
Today, the water cycle is changing a lot because of humans.
Ice is melting at the poles.
Deserts are growing larger.
Are we using too much of earths limited water supply?
No one is sure which direction the ride will go next.
Water remains our most precious resource.
We should do what we can to protect the water cycle.
Without water, there would be no magical roller-coaster ride of life!
