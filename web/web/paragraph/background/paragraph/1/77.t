Today Sally Oh, a reporter, is interviewing a successful advertising agency executive, Amy Baines, who uses the Internet at work to watch her 3-year-old son Harry while he is at day care.
Sally:Tell us about your work and about Harrys schedule while youre at work.
Amy:I start work at 9:00 and finish at 6:00.
I work all week, and sometimes I have to travel.
Harry is at the day-care center from 8:30 until 6:30.
Its a long day for both of us.
Sally:And you can keep in touch with Harry during the day?
Amy:Thats right.
Sally:How do you get to see Harry during the day?
Amy:The day-care center has a video camera that is connected to a special website.
When I want to see him, I can call up the website and see the center on my computer screen.
Sally:How does that make you feel?
Amy:Wonderful.
For example, when I dropped Harry off at the center yesterday, he started to cry.
I had to leave, but he just wouldnt stop crying.
I felt bad, but I needed to get to work.
Then at work, I was so worried that I couldnt concentrate.
So I logged on and went to the website.
I could see Harry playing a
game, as happy as could be.
It made me feel better.
What a relief!
concentrate on my
work and had a very
productive morning.
Sally:Can anyone visit the website?
You need a special name and password to get into the system.
Sally:Do the day-care workers like it?
Amy:At first, they felt self-conscious.
But now, they dont seem to notice.
The activity in the day-care center goes on as usual.
Sally:How often do you log on to see your son?
Amy:Usually about four or five times a day.
I just like to see him and know what kind of day hes having.
Sally:Does the camera follow the children everywhere?
Amy:Almost everywhere.
Its not on in the room where the children take their naps or in the book corner.
But if I log on and dont see him, I can ask his teacher to bring him over into the view of the camera.
Sally:Do you consider it good for the day-care center to have such a system?
Amy:I think so.
Its good because I can check in and find out whether the center is doing good work with Harry.
I can see whether he is getting enough attention and if the center is following the educational program that they say they offer.
Sally:Are there any other benefits to this system?
My parents, who live 2,000 miles away, can log on and see their first grandchild doing important new things.
With the Internet, its as though were living in the same house.
Sally Oh thanks Amy Baines for the interview.
Sally concludes by saying that day-care centers with video cameras linked to websites are good for working parents.
These parents can concentrate at work because they know that their children are getting good care thanks to the wonders of technology.
