Unit 6  When in Bulgaria, Do as the Bulgarians Do.
On the first day of Mikes trip to Bulgaria, he had his lunch in a local restaurant.
After Mike finished his delicious meal, a friendly waitress asked him about his food.
Mike spoke very little Bulgarian, so he nodded his head to tell her that he had enjoyed the meal.
To his surprise, Mike noticed the waitress frown after his reply.
Was there something wrong with the waitressXor with Mike?
The story above shows that even though people throughout the world use body language to communicate without speaking, the meanings of the same gesture can vary widely.
A positive gesture in one country can mean something quite different in another.
Therefore, it is better for travelers to get to know a countrys culture before they visit it.
In India, for example, people use the head bobble to express their approval.
Indians tilt their heads from side to side when they agree with others.
This can confuse people who shake their heads from left to right to show disagreement.
Some people say that the Indian head bobble grew out of watching snake charming.
The snakes move from side to side when they are not going to bite, which means I am of no threat to you. This may offer an explanation for Indians use of the head bobble to express a positive answer.
From time to time, using the wrong gesture in the wrong place can bring about a lot of trouble.
In Greece, the gesture of showing ones palm toward someone is called the moutza. This gesture is very insulting and may bring trouble on those people who make it.
Thats because Greek criminals faces were covered in ashes (moutzos in Greek) as a punishment in earlier times.
The ashes were placed on a criminals face with an open palm, so the gesture itself became insulting.
As a result of this tradition, it would be impolite of you to let your palm face outward when you wave goodbye in Greece.
Luckily for Mike, an English-speaking couple who were sitting next to him in the restaurant came to his rescue.
They explained that nodding ones head is a negative answer in Bulgaria, while shaking ones head from left to right is a positive one.
Mike, thus, realized that he had made a mistake.
He called the waitress over, pointed to his plate, and shook his head.
By doing so, he hoped that she would bring him some dessert.
