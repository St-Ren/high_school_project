I learned most of what I really need to know about belief and living in kindergarten.
Wisdom is as important at the top of the graduate school mountain as it is in the sandbox at nursery school.
These are the things I learned: Share everything.
Play fair.
Don't hit people.
Put things back where you found them.
Clean up your own mess.
Don't take things that aren't yours.
Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody.
Wash your hands before you eat.
Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you.
Live a balanced life.
Learn some, think some, draw, and paint some.
Sing, dance, play, and work some every day.
Take a nap every afternoon.
When you go outside, watch for traffic, hold hands, and stick together.
Be aware of wonder.
Remember the little seed in the plastic cup.
The roots go down and the plant goes up.
Nobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that.
Goldfish, hamsters, white mice, and even the little seed in the plastic cupthey all die.
And then remember the book about Dick and Jane and the first word you learned, the biggest word of all: LOOK.
Everything you need to know is in there somewhere.
The Golden Rule, love, basic cleanliness, ecology, politics, and sensible livingyou name it.
Think of what a better world it will be if we allthe whole worldhave cookies and milk at  three o'clock every afternoon and then lie down with our blankets for a nap.
Also think of what if we would always put things back where we found them and clean up our own messes.
And it is still true; no matter how old you are, when you go outside, it is best to hold hands and stick together.
While what I learned in kindergarten is much more basic than what I learned in graduate school, the lessons are no less important.
