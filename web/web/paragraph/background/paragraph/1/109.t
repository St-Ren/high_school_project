At the top of a three-story brick building in Greenwich Village, where many artists lived, Sue and Joanna had their studio.
They had met at a restaurant and found their tastes in art, food, and fashion so similar that they decided to become roommates.
That was in May.
In November the cold, wet weather brought sickness to the neighborhood where the two women lived, and Joanna became very ill with pneumonia.
She lay on her bed, looking through the window at the side of the next brick house.
One morning the doctor spoke to Sue.
She has one chance in ten, he said.
And that chance will come only if she wants to live.
Your friend has made up her mind that shes not going to get well.
When a patient begins to think that way, there is little that medicine can do.
After the doctor had gone, Sue cried and cried.
Finally she walked into Joannas room and found her lying on the bed with her eyes wide open.
She was looking out the window and counting backward.
Twelve, she said, eleven, ten, nine,....
The leaves on the ivy vine are falling faster now.
There are only five left.
When the last one falls, I must go, too.
Im tired of waiting.
I want to let go of everything, and go sailing down, down, just like one of those poor leaves.
Oh, I have never heard of such nonsense, complained Sue.
Try to sleep.
I must go talk to Mr. Behrman.
Old Mr. Behrman was a painter who lived beneath them.
He was past sixty and was a failure in art.
He had always said he was going to paint a masterpiece, but had never begun one.
For years he had painted almost nothing, but spent much of his time drinking.
He was a fierce old man, yet he was very fond of Sue and Joanna.
Sue told Behrman what Joanna had said about the leaves.
Ah, that poor little Miss Joanna, said Behrman.
Some day I will paint a masterpiece.
The next morning Sue found Joanna again staring out the window.
But, what had happened?
Though it had rained heavily the night before, and the wind had blown hard, there yet stood out against the brick wall one ivy leaf.
It was the last on the vine.
I thought it would surely fall during the night, said Joanna.
It will fall today, and I shall die at the same time.
Yet, as the day passed, and it began to grow dark, the lone ivy leaf clung to its stem against the wall.
The next day as well, the ivy leaf was still there.
Ive been a bad girl, Sue, said Joanna.
Something has made that last leaf stay there to show how wrong I was.
It is a sin to want to die.
The doctor came in the afternoon and again spoke to Sue.
Take care of her, and she will recover.
Now I must go and see the old artist downstairs.
He has pneumonia, too, but he is an old, weak man.
There is no hope for him.
By the next day, Joanna was out of danger.
Sue came to her bed and put one arm around her.
I have something to tell you, Joanna,she said.
Mr. Behrman died of pneumonia today.
He became sick two days ago.
When someone found him in his room, his shoes and clothing were wet through and icy cold.
They couldnt imagine where he had been on such a dreadful night.
And then they found a lantern, a ladder, and some brushes and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed on it.
Darling, look out the window at the leaf on the wall.
Didnt you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew?
Its Behrmans masterpiece-he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell.
