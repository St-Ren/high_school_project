Unit 12  A Hero Called Frankenstein.
Are you a fan of sci-fi movies such as Transformers, Man of Steel, or Spider-Man?
The sci-fi elements in these films may appeal to you, but did you know that the majority of sci-fi movies have actually been inspired by Mary Shelleys Frankenstein?
Frankenstein is regarded as the first work of science fiction.
If Mary Shelley had not written this novel, many popular sci-fi characters might not have ever been created.
The title of this novel comes from the name of its hero, Victor Frankenstein, an enthusiastic scientist who found the incredible secret about the creation of life.
Excited by this discovery, Frankenstein kept exploring more deeply into the secret to creating a human being.
Often in the dead of night, he stole and collected dead bodies from graves.
Fascinated by his project, Frankenstein buried himself in his work.
At last, his creature was completed and finally came to life.
Contrary to Frankensteins expectations, however, the creature that he had made turned out to be a giant, frightening monster.
Frankenstein was so alarmed that he fled in horror.
The following day, he returned but found that the monster was gone.
When wandering the world alone, the monster was not welcome anywhere because of his terrible appearance.
Hatred for his creator gradually grew in the monsters mind, and this drove him to murder Frankensteins brother.
Frankenstein blamed himself as he learned of his brothers death.
He thought that he should never have created such a horrible being.
Just as Frankenstein fell into a deep depression, the monster turned up in front of him.
Upon meeting Frankenstein again, the monster poured out his heart.
In tears, he asked Frankenstein to create a female monster for him, since it was impossible for humans to love a monster.
Otherwise, the monster told Frankenstein that he would make Frankensteins life more miserable.
Although agreeing to the monsters request at first, Frankenstein soon had second thoughts.
The thought that the two might bear children frightened him, so he destroyed the half-finished creature.
I should not have made such a promise, he thought to himself.
Upon learning what Frankenstein had done, the monster became so angry that he killed Frankensteins wife and his best friend in revenge.
To prevent more misfortunes, Frankenstein followed the monster to the North Pole to hunt him down.
Nevertheless, he never succeededXin the end he died from the cold.
After learning of Frankensteins death, the monster disappeared and was nowhere to be seen again.
Perhaps it never occurred to Frankenstein that he had to be responsible for the monster he created.
He had probably never expected that his enthusiasm for science would lead to so many tragedies.
Interestingly, many people have often mistaken the creatures name for Frankenstein. For them, maybe the scientist is the real monster.
