Long ago in Italy, in the city of Verona, there lived two noble families, the Capulets and the Montagues.
For as long as anyone could remember, an argument had existed between these two families.
One day Romeo, a Montague, heard that there was going to be a party that night at the house of the Capulets.
He decided to go in a mask so that none would know him as a Montague.
Romeo arrived at the Capulets home just as the dancing began.
He looked around the room.
Suddenly his eyes fell upon a girl so beautiful that he almost lost his mind.
O, she does teach the lights to burn bright!
I never saw true beauty until tonight.
Then Romeo watched for an opportunity to speak to the girl.
next dance ended, he went forward and took her by the hand and said, I wish I could have a tender kiss!
Please give me your hands, not your lips, the girl answered.
O, dear, let lips do what hands do, said Romeo, and he kissed her gently.
Just then a woman told the girl to speak with her
Who is her mother Romeo asked.
The lady of the house, said the woman.
Romeo was shocked.
It seemed that the whole world was falling apart.
He, a Montague, had fallen hopelessly in love with the daughter of old Capulet!
He left the party in confusion.
Juliet saw him leaving and sent her servant girl to find out his name.
When the girl returned with the news that he was Romeo, the only son of old Montague, Juliet found it too horrible to believe.
My only love started from my only hate! she said sadly.
Romeo walked home past the Capulets orchard.
He stopped and climbed over the orchard wall.
Romeo hid in the darkness and looked up at the Capulets house, hoping to see his love.
Suddenly he saw her.
What light breaks through the window he said to himself.
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. He watched as Juliet stood at the balcony, leaning her cheek upon her hand.
O, if I were a glove upon the hand, said Romeo, I might touch that cheek!
Juliet sighed sadly.
Romeo, Romeo!
Where are you, Romeo?
Give up your father, and refuse your name; or, if you promise your love, Ill no longer be a Capulet.
Romeo listened as she went on.
Its your name that is my enemy,  O, be some other name!
Whats in a name?
That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
Juliet was surprised to hear Romeos voice answer from the darkness: Call me but love, and Ill have a new name; from now on, I never will be Romeo. Juliet asked how he had made his way into the garden surrounded by high stone walls.
With loves light wings I landed on these walls, he said, for stony limits cannot hold love out.
That night they exchanged vows of love and agreed to get married the next day braving all hardships and great dangers there might be in their future.
