Communicating with Parents: An Impossible Mission?
Do you find it impossible to communicate with your parents?
If so, youre not alone.
Most teenagers say their parents dont communicate with them but instead just say no to every request.
However, the following examples may show you a possible way out.
Jessie: Last summer vacation, Dad didnt let me get a part-time job.
I felt so angry I wanted to walk away, but I didnt give up because I wanted to learn to be independent through a part-time job.
At first, Dad said no.
But seeing that I was determined, he changed his mind and said he would help me to find a job.
I was delighted when Dad said yes.
To repay his agreement, I worked hard all summer as a convenience store clerk and learned a lot.
On payday, I took my parents to a nice restaurant.
Being patient and understanding helps me bridge the generation gap.
Lisa: Last semester, my mom stopped me from joining the dance club.
She thought it would take time away from studying.
I lost my temper and yelled at her.
I felt bad about my behavior, but I was too embarrassed to apologize.
It tortured me for a whole night.
The next morning when I saw Mom, I stuttered, Mom, Im K sorry.
IX She interrupted, saying, Never mind, dear. The apology comforted her.
I promised to study hard to get straight As, and she finally allowed me to join the club.
From this, I learned that apologizing is the key to opening a closed mind.
Allen: Once I came home late because I was studying in the library and had lost track of time.
Mom scolded me as soon as I got home.
I felt upset and locked myself in my room, thinking, Im old enough.
Why not trust me I even thought of leaving home.
However, the next morning when I heard Mom making breakfast, I changed my mind and wrote her a letter, explaining why I had come home late and apologizing for the trouble Id caused.
To my surprise, Mom called me and said she was sorry.
So, writing a note can be a good way to communicate.
From these students, we learn that a positive attitudeXpatience, understanding, and not being afraid to apologizeXcan help us communicate with our parents.
When they wont listen, we may even try writing them a letter.
So, if we practice these methods, communicating with our parents may be a mission possible.
