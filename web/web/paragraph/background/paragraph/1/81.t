On January 9, 2003, 159 whales were discovered on a beach in New Zealand.
Although about 50 people worked very hard, they managed to help
only about 40 whales return to the sea.
More than 100 died before they
could be rescued.
People have been aware of the problem of beached whales
for a long time.
Even the ancient Romans wrote about finding
whales on their shores.
Although efforts to help beached
whales have increased, they are still usually unsuccessful.
Little is known about the reasons why whales end up on beaches in the first place.
However, people have come up with a number of possibilities.
Some think that the whales get lost and swim to shore.
Others believe the whales first become sick and then float to shore.
Still others think the whales sometimes have problems with their sonar navigation and therefore cannot see the beach.
It has even been suggested that the whales are killing themselves in order to leave more food for members of their family.
So which reason is it?
Why do whales end up on beaches?
It seems to be a combination of some of the above reasons.
If a whale gets sick (like the whale found on a beach in Spain that had swallowed over 50 kg of plastic bags), it may not be able to swim and may float to shore.
But as in the case of the New Zealand whales, how could so many get beached at the same time?
The reason is, whales are social animals.
If one member of a whale group swims onto a beach, it is possible that others may follow.
Some people think that noises made by human activities (from ships or submarines) affect the whales use of sonar.
Whales use sound waves to know where they are going and may get confused if there is too much background noise in the ocean.
In fact, the U.S. Navy admitted that its powerful sonar could be the reason for the beaching
of whales in the Bahamas in
March, 2000.
People, who try to help beached whales, know that saving beached whales is very difficult.
A whale is a huge animal whose body cannot support its own weight out of water.
Also, the sun and sand can quickly cause a beached whale to get too hot.
All agree that the best place for a whale is in the ocean, but sometimes the whale just does not seem to think so.
It will take many more years of study before humans can help the whales stay safe in the water.
