Volunteers are caring and selfless people of all ages, genders, occupations, and nationalities.
You must have heard touching stories about the volunteers who helped victims of natural disasters.
They rushed to help the victims after the 1 earthquake in Taiwan, the 2 Asian tsunami, and the 2 earthquake in Sichuan.
Yet volunteers do much more than that.
Some volunteers clean up beaches and neighborhoods or take care of stray animals.
Others run errands for old people living by themselves.
And still others help traffic police or firefighters on the job.
There are always opportunities for caring individuals to offer their services.
In Taiwan, there are some well-known volunteer organizations, including Tzu Chi Foundation, the Red Cross, World Vision, and the Genesis Social Welfare Foundation.
These associations have millions of members who serve people in need every day.
The Youth Knowledge Network (YKN) is a smaller but equally active volunteer organization mainly composed of college and high school students in Taiwan.
It helps these young people learn and grow by serving in many volunteer projects.
The YKN members have taught the elderly Net surfing and helped children in remote areas build up a connection with the outside world.
They have studied the controversial issue of Makau National Park and launched the AIDS Caring Project to protect the rights of AIDS victims.
In each project, they use the Internet to exchange ideas and information with other young people around the world.
You may wonder why more and more people want to devote themselves to volunteer work.
In fact, volunteering offers many benefits.
First of all, it offers valuable job experience and skills for your future career.
Volunteer work can also teach you a lot about yourself and promote your personal development.
In addition, you can learn about your strengths, weaknesses, and the kind of work you like to do.
You can learn how to deal with other people and build relationships.
Best of all, since you know you are helping others and making a difference, volunteer work brings a deep sense of happiness.
Volunteers make the world a better place and make themselves better people.
So if you've never done any kind of volunteer work, now it's time to get started!
