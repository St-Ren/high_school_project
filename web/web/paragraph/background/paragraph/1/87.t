Unit 12  Working for Nothing Pays Off.
Volunteers have long played an important role in our lives.
They are enthusiastic people who simply like to help others and never ask for payment.
The concept of volunteering began centuries ago.
In the early American colonies, people were expected to spend their spare time helping out in their communities.
Benjamin Franklin, one of the most influential politicians in American history, put this idea into practice by setting up a volunteer fire department in Philadelphia.
Today, most rural communities and many small towns in the U.S.A. still depend on volunteers to fight fires.
In modern society, volunteer work remains as important as it has ever been.
In fact, more and more people are taking part in volunteer work.
For example, they take scout groups on camping trips, clean up town parks, and pick up litter along hiking trails.
Whats more, they also visit the sick and the elderly to provide them with care and help.
It is obvious that volunteer work helps society.
However, does it also help the volunteers?
Do volunteers get anything out of their work, besides the sense of achievement?
Sure they do.
Through volunteer work, most people can get valuable experience and knowledge.
Many volunteers can also learn new skills which prepare them for full-time jobs.
Moreover, it might surprise you that such experience is sometimes as helpful as a degree when it comes to landing a job.
Let us say you sort mail in the office of a hospital on weekdays.
When the weekend comes, it is time for you, the volunteer, to go out and raise funds on the busy city streets or in front of shopping centers.
Now, it may seem worthless to do all of this unpaid work.
But when you are looking for a paid job, the experience youve gained as a volunteer may give you an advantage over other job seekers.
That is, job seekers with volunteer experience are more likely to be hired than those people who have never volunteered.
The reason is that they have had more chances to learn how to handle difficulties.
Of course, volunteer work may have nothing to do with the career you want to pursue.
Does that mean theres no benefit in it?
Absolutely not!
Volunteer work can teach you a lot about yourselfXand this is probably the greatest benefit of all.
Volunteer work can also help you explore what you are able to do best.
In addition, it can help you learn about certain kinds of work and the way to deal with other people as well.
Your future is important, and your service to society is important, too.
Have you ever volunteered?
If you havent, its time for you to get involved in such unpaid work!
