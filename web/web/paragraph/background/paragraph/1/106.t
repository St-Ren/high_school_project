Unit 8  Mothers Hands.
Night after night, Mom came to tuck me in, even long after my childhood years.
As part of her nightly routine, she would lean down, push my long hair out of the way, and then kiss me on the forehead.
I dont remember when it started annoying meXher hands touching my face that way.
But it did annoy me, for they felt rough against my young skin.
One night, I finally roared, Dont do that anymoreXyour hands are too rough! Upon hearing this, Mom stepped out of my room without saying a word.
I lay awake long afterward with my words haunting me.
However, pride suppressed the voice of my conscience, and I didnt tell her I was sorry.
From that day forward, Mom would never again close out my day with that familiar expression of her love.
With the passing years, my thoughts have time after time returned to that night.
I realized one thing: If I had been mature enough, I would not have said such a mean thing to my mom.
I missed Moms hands and her good-night kiss.
Sometimes, the incident seemed very close and sometimes far away, and yet it was always thereXin the back of my mind.
Years have passed, and I am no longer a young girl.
Mom is in her mid-seventies, and those hands I once thought were too rough are still taking care of me and my family.
They have reached into medicine cabinets for a remedy to calm a girls upset stomach or soothe the pain of a boys scraped knee.
These very same hands have also cooked the best fried chicken in the world, gotten stains out of my jeans, and dished out ice cream on hot summer days.
Now, my own children are grown and gone, and Mom doesnt have Dad any longer.
On special occasions, I go to her place to spend the night with her.
On the night before a Thanksgiving, as I drifted into sleep in my old bedroom, a loving hand hesitantly stole across my face to brush the hair from my forehead.
Then a kiss, ever so gently, touched my eyebrow.
For the thousandth time, I recalled the night when my young voice had ungratefully complained.
I understood that if I had apologized to Mom on the spot, I might not have been so regretful later.
Right then, upon sensing that she was about to leave, I involuntarily seized her hand in mine.
I told her how sorry I was for that night.
To my surprise, Mom didnt get angry at me; in fact, she didnt even remember the incident.
She had forgivenXand forgottenXlong before.
That night, I fell asleep with a new appreciation of my gentle mother and her caring hands.
The guilt I had carried around for so long was nowhere to be found.
