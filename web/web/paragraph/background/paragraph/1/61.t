Have you ever thought about what famous people from the past were like in real life?
What did people who met them think about them?
The following are the stories about three famous people.
My Father Isn't That Rich.
This is a story about the millionaire, John D. Rockefeller, and was told by a friend of his.
This friend said that though Rockefeller gave away millions, he was known for being very stingy about small sums of money.
One day he went to a hotel in New York City.
When he arrived, he asked for the cheapest room they had.
When the manager gave him a room, Rockefeller said, "Is that the cheapest room you have?
I'm staying here by myself and only need a small room."
The manager said, "That room is the smallest and the cheapest one we have," and added, "but why are you taking such a cheap room?
When your son stays here, he always takes our most expensive room; yours is the cheapest one we've got."
"Yes," said Rockefeller, "but his father is a wealthy man; mine isn't."
Something for Everybody.
One day Abraham Lincoln was ill and did not want to listen to people asking him for jobs.
Just as one of these men came for a long interview, the President's doctor happened to enter the room.
Lincoln asked him, "Doctor, what are these red spots on my hands?"
"That's mild smallpox.
It is very contagious."
Lincoln's visitor got up at this point and said, "Well, I need to leave now.
I just came to see how you were.
I'll come again."
Then he headed for the door in a hurry.
"There's one good thing about this," said Lincoln as the man left,
"I now have something to give everybody."
Mark Twain 's Absent-mindedness.
The famous American writer Mark Twain was well-known for his absent-mindedness.
One day, when he was riding on a train, the conductor asked him for his ticket.
Mark Twain looked for the ticket in all his pockets but without success.
However, the conductor knew the writer by sight, and said, "It doesn't really matter.
Show me your ticket on your way back.
And if you don't find it, there's no harm done."
"Oh, but I must find the darned thing; otherwise, how will I know where I'm going?"
From the stories above, you can see that, despite their different professions, the three famous people all had one thing in common: a great sense of humor.
Obviously they were able to amuse others and be amused, and to bring joy to all.
