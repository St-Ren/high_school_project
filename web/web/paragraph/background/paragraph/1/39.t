A Prescription for Mozart.
Imagine going to your doctor with a headache.
Your doctor gives you a prescription.
It is not for aspirin, but for Mozart.
Many kinds of music can produce strong feelings.
For some people, romantic music brings feelings of love.
Spiritual music can help some people feel peace.
But one musician in particular seems to have an ability to heal the human body: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
Scientists have found Mozarts music to be able to calm its listeners.
It can also help them express themselves clearly.
Many cases in which Mozart is used as a healing aid have been reported.
For example, a premature baby named Krissy, who weighed just one and a half pounds, was on total life support.
Doctors thought she had little chance to live.
But her mother kept playing Mozart for Krissy and thought it might save her daughters life.
To their surprise, Krissy lived, and at the age of four she showed an interest in music.
Krissy was able to play musical pieces from memory that were far beyond the ability of an average four-year-old.
Other stories also show the effect of Mozarts music.
Officials in Washington State report that newcomers from Asia learn English more quickly when they listen to Mozart.
In Canada, it seems that Mozart string quartets performing in city squares can calm pedestrian traffic.
Even animals respond to Mozart.
In France, cows give more milk when they listen to Mozart.
Why Mozart, not Bach or the Beatles?
Any kind of music can have an effect on some people.
But Mozart has more balance than most.
It is not too fast or too slow; it is just right.
Don Campbell, writer of The Mozart Effect, says, Its like food.
A hot spicy meal will affect you differently than a sweet dessert.
While you might love these foods, they arent good for you to eat every day.
You need simple, nutritious food on a steady basis.
Thats the way Mozart is.
Its like a well-balanced meal that brings order and harmony to your body.
