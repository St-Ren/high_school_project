For many people around the world, the first bicycle they ever rode was probably a Giant bicycle.
A Giant bicycle is not an oversized bike designed for extremely large people, but a bike made by Taiwan's Giant Manufacturing Co., Ltd.
There is a saying, "Once you learn how to ride a bike, you never forget."
Company chairperson King Liu has never forgotten how to ride a bike!
At the age of seventy-three, Mr. Liu circled Taiwan on a 1-day journey called "Ride Life."
He experienced Taiwan's culture, food, and people along the way on his bicycle.
"Driving is too quick; it doesn't allow you to see anything," Liu said.
"And walking is too slow.
Indeed, cycling is the best way to experience the beauty of the island."
Liu encouraged people to experience a "Ride Life" as he did.
"Life is more exciting if it is experienced on a bicycle," he said.
When Giant started business over thirty years ago, bicycles were used mainly for transportation.
Through the years, however, Giant has made a great effort to promote the concept of "Ride Life."
In this effort, Giant has set up bicycle rental services in some big cities.
This helps spread the popularity of cycling as a leisure activity.
As a result, more and more people in Taiwan are now seeking a healthier lifestyle through cycling.
Giant is quite different from other companies.
Years ago, many companies gave up or changed over to making other products.
But Giant stayed with what they believed in-bicycles.
Now Giant is one of the largest and most successful bike producers in the world.
But its officials are not satisfied with that.
They want people to protect the environment by driving less.
They also hope that everyone can experience life in a fun and healthy way.
It is no wonder that Giant deserves to be a giant in the bicycle world!
