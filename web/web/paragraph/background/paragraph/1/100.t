Unit 2  In Love with a Cell Phone.
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
I left my cell phone at home, so I went back to get it, Adam said as he apologized to Vicky after arriving an hour late for their first date.
Vicky tried to be polite, so she forced a smile and replied, Its all right.
Lets order something to eat. While they were waiting for their food, Vicky discovered that Adam had been checking his cell phone.
Just as she got the chance to talk to him, Adams cell phone rang and he answered it without delay.
He talked continuously and totally ignored his date, who was sitting right next to him.
Twenty minutes later, when Adam finally hung up and turned back to Vicky, he saw nothing but a furious face.
Why dont you date your cell phone said Vicky.
Then, she stood up and shouted, Dont ever call me again!
Obviously, Vicky felt insulted and believed that Adam had a greater crush on his cell phone than he had on her.
In fact, like Adam, many people who have cell phones in modern society cant stand to be separated from their cell phones.
With their cell phones, they talk to others, listen to music, check e-mail, and download applications as well as photos.
Their dependence on this technological device has become so great that the cell phone is now often considered a necessity rather than a luxury.
Some cell phone addicts cannot even imagine life without their cell phones.
As a result, a psychological term known as disconnect anxiety was born.
According to psychologists, when these addicts are not using their phones, they may start to feel uneasy.
Some feel socially isolated when they cant get access to their cell phone contacts.
Others worry about not being able to respond to emergencies promptly.
Still others are so psychologically influenced by their cell phones that they often believe their phones have been ringing without their knowledge.
Those who suffer from disconnect anxiety frequently check their cell phones for any missed calls or messages.
In addition, they like to keep contacting their friendsXeven just to kill time.
Whats more, if these heavy cell phone users discover that they have forgotten to bring their cell phones along with them, they will insist on returning home to get their cells.
Its nice to have a cell phone, and it makes sense, of course, to enjoy all the advantages this clever product has brought.
However, we need to use it wisely.
For example, when we are doing something important, we should turn off our cell phones to concentrate on our work.
As for Adam, he had better leave his cell phone at home on his next date with VickyXif he gets another chance to go out with her!
