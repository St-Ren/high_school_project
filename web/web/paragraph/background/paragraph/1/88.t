Unit 2  A Lesson in Forgiveness.
When I was a kid, I delivered newspapers in my community every day.
On a quiet Saturday afternoon, my friend and I were bored, so we randomly picked an old ladys house to be part of our game of throwing stones.
We wanted to see the stones turn into missiles as they rolled to the roofs edge and shot out into the yard.
To me, they looked just like comets that fell from the sky.
I found a stone and sent it for a ride.
However, the stone was too smooth to grasp, so it slipped out of my hand when I threw it.
It hit a small window in the ladys house with a crash.
Since we were frightened of being caught, we escaped at the sound of the broken glass.
For the next few days, I was so worried about myself that I did not think of the old lady and her broken window.
Later on, when I was sure that I wasnt in trouble, I started to feel guilty.
Every day, the old lady greeted me with a warm smile as I passed her the paper, but I didnt feel comfortable in her presence anymore.
Finally, I made up my mind to save the money which I made from delivering newspapers.
I calculated that seven dollars should cover the cost of repairing her window, and in three weeks, I had the seven dollars ready.
I put the money in an envelope and wrote a note that said, I am sorry for breaking your window.
I hope that the money will cover the cost of repairing it.
When it was dark, I crept quietly to the old ladys house and slipped the envelope under her door.
After I did so, I felt relieved and couldnt wait to look her straight in the eye once again.
The next day, I handed the old lady her paper and happily returned the warm smile that I received from her.
She thanked me for the paper and gave me a bag of cookies.
I thanked her and then left.
I walked away and enjoyed the cookies.
They tasted great.
After I had eaten several, I discovered an envelope inside the bag and pulled it out.
When I opened it up, I was very surprised.
In the envelope, there were the seven dollars and a short note that said, Im proud of you!
