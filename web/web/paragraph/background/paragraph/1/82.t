There are no secrets of success.
What is success?
Success is doing the things you know you should do.
Success is not doing the things you know you should not do.
Success is not just one area of your life.
It includes all of the roles you play and your relationships, such as student, friend, wife or husband, parent, neighbor, worker, and many others.
Success is not confined to any part of your personality but related to the development of all the parts: body, mind, heart, and spirit.
It is making the most of your whole self.
Success is finding your best talents and abilities and using them in the way they will make the best contribution to others.
It is true to say that achieving something is a way of finding out your ability.
Success is focusing your full
power on what you have a burning
desire to accomplish.
Success is a result of ones attitude.
It calls for love, joy, optimism, confidence, faith, strength, imagination, and patience.
Success is not arriving at the top of a mountain as a final goal.
It is moving up a spiral of progress that never stops.
It is continuous growth.
Success is having the courage to meet failure without being beaten.
It is not allowing present loss to interfere with your long-term goal.
Success is accepting the challenge of the difficult.
In the inspiring words of Phillips Brooks: Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers.
Pray for powers equal to your tasks.
Then the doing of your work shall be no miracle, but you shall be the miracle.
