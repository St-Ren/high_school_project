Bugs All Around.
Good night, sleep tight,
Dont let the bugs bite;
If they do, dont squall,
Take a spoon and eat them all.
When someone talks about insects or bugs, most of us express a feeling of disgust.
However, this nursery rhyme expresses this feeling in an interesting way.
After all, we dont eat things we dislike.
Among all insects, mosquitoes are certainly the most irritating ones in our life.
We all have had the experience of being disturbed by them and of swatting them at once without thinking.
But poets have the ability to change such a disturbing creature into a lively figure.
The following poem is a good example:
The Mosquitoes
Mosquitoes are thin.
Mosquitoes are rude.
They feast on your skin
For take-out food.
Here the poet talks about mosquitoes in a humorous way.
Mosquitoes are not just irritating insects, for they become diners who feed on our blood.
Not all insects are as irritating as mosquitoes.
Some, like crickets, are liked by most people.
Crickets are the theme of the following poem:
The Crickets
You dont need tickets
To listen to crickets.
They fiddle and sing
By rubbing each wing,
And never will charge you a fee.
Crickets are fiddlers who play free music in this poem.
Their sound at night is more pleasant to people than the buzzing noise of mosquitoes.
And most of all, crickets dont bite.
Perhaps they might even be your favorite insect.
From these poems, we can see that the things around us, even things we hate like insects, may become lovely if we just use our imagination.
If we are able to observe things carefully, we can write simple poems about them.
Then we will become poets who turn common things into wonders.
