Its just another morning in 2050.
Mario, your buddy bio-bot, comes over to wake you up: Time for school, Elmer.
Dont forget to hand in your final report.
Remember, its your fifth year in high school. What a nice buddy Mario is!
With a word of thanks to Mario, you hurry to the bathroom.
Morning, Elmer, says the wireless magic mirror.
You look good as usual.
But be careful about your BMI.
Youre about to become overweight. A bunch of icons appear on the wall.
You press one of them.
At once a flash of light flies across to you and your body fat changes into electricity for heating the water.
Now, you can enjoy a nice hot shower, quite sure that you have just reduced your BMI.
On the other side of the house, the mobile table in the kitchen detects your hunger.
It starts the toaster and makes your scrambled eggs the way you like them.
As you finish breakfast, you turn your attention to your heartbeat-powered watch.
It reads 7:57 VV only three minutes to your first class!
Suddenly, you recall the flying car parked in the garage, a gift to your father from his boss.
He wont be driving it today; he walks to the office when it is sunny.
The flying car can take off and fly three meters above the road.
Beep, welcome! it says to you as it opens its door.
Thanks for riding in me.
Where are you heading?
School! you say.
Full speed! Quickly, the flying car takes off, and within just thirty seconds youre in school.
You get to your classroom right on time.
After school, you fly home again.
As Mario passes to you an ice-cold bottle of soda, you notice a text message hovering in the air.
Your new order, the wearable computer, has arrived.
You can collect it from the store at any time.
Thank you. What a nice surprise!
You have been expecting one since it was put on the market a week ago.
Just as you are wondering how to show off this new gadget to your classmates, another text message flies in and hovers right in front of you, this time for your father:
Mr. Wilson, the vehicle registration card of your flying car will be suspended.
You have been accused of speeding.
Air Traffic Police
