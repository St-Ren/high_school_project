The Luncheon.
I met her at the play and sat down beside her.
It was long since I had last seen her, and I almost didnt recognize her.
How time flies! she said.
Do you remember the first time I saw you?
You asked me to luncheon. Did I remember?
It was twenty years ago.
I was living in Paris and was earning very little money.
She said she would like to have a chat with me, and asked if I would give her a little luncheon at Foyots.
Well, Foyots was such an expensive restaurant that I had never thought of going there.
But I was too young to have learned to say no to a woman.
I had eighty francs for the month, and a simple luncheon should cost fifteen.
If I cut out coffee for the next two weeks, I could manage.
We met at Foyots.
She was charming and talkative.
I was surprised when the menu was brought, for the prices were much higher than I had expected.
But she reassured me.
I never eat anything for luncheon, she said.
Oh, dont say that! I answered politely.
I never eat more than one thing.
A little fish, perhaps.
I wonder if they have any salmon.Well, salmon was not on the menu, but I asked the waiter if there was any.
Yes, a beautiful salmon had just come in.
I ordered it for my guest.
The waiter asked if she wanted anything else.
No, she answered.
I never eat more than one thing, unless you have a little caviar. My heart sank a little: I knew I could not afford caviar, but I could not tell her that.
I told the waiter to bring caviar.
For myself I chose the cheapest dish on the menu, a pork chop.
I think youre unwise to eat meat, she said.
I dont believe in overloading my stomach.Then came the question of drink.
I never drink anything for luncheon, she said.
Neither do I, I said quickly.
Except white wine, she went on.
Its wonderful for the digestion.I ordered half a bottle.
What are you going to drink she asked.
Water.She ate the caviar and the salmon.
She talked gaily about literature and music.
I wondered about the bill.
The waiter came again.
She waved him away.
No, no, I never eat anything for luncheon.
I couldnt possibly eat anything more unless they had some of those giant asparagus. My heart sank lower.
I knew they were horribly expensive, but I ordered some.
Arent you going to have any?No, I never eat asparagus.Oh, the fact is, you ruin your sense of taste by all the meat you eat.We waited for the asparagus.
Panic seized me.
I did not know whether I had enough to pay the bill.
I decided if it was too much, I would jump up and say my money had been stolen.
The asparagus looked delicious.
I watched the woman eat them in large mouthfuls, and I talked politely about literature and drama.
At last she finished.
Coffee I said.
Yes, just an ice cream and coffee, she answered.
I was past caring now, so I ordered coffee for myself as well.
You know, she said, as she ate the ice cream.
I believe one should always get up from a meal feeling one could eat a little more.Are you still hungry I asked weakly.
You see, I never eat more than one thing for luncheon.
I was speaking for you.Oh, I see!Just then, the waiter came by with a basket of huge peaches.
But surely peaches were not in season then.
I knew they must be extremely expensive.
My guest, going on with her conversation, took one.
You see, youve filled your stomach with a lot of meat and you cant eat anymore.
But Ive just had a snack and I shall enjoy a peach.The bill came, and I was barely able to pay it.
But when I left the restaurant I had the whole month before me and not a penny in my pocket.
Follow my example, she said as we shook hands, and never eat more than one thing for luncheon.?
Ill do better than that, I said, Ill eat nothing for dinner tonight.Humorist! she cried gaily, jumping into a cab.
Youre quite a humorist!But I have had my revenge at last.
I am not a mean person, but I must say I was pleased when I saw her again at the play.
She now weighs three hundred pounds.
