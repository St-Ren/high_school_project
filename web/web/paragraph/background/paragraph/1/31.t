Into Aesops World.
A fable is a short story, or folktale, which uses animals as characters and teaches us some kind of moral or moral lesson.
Many people are familiar with Aesops Fables.
The following are two of them.
Maybe you can figure out the moral each fable is trying to teach you.
The Jay and the Peacock.
A jay that was not satisfied with his appearance walked into a yard where peacocks lived.
He found that on the ground were a number of feathers.
They must have fallen from the peacocks when they were changing feathers.
I can collect and use them to decorate my body, thought the jay.
Then he tied the feathers to his tail and strode with pride toward the peacocks.
But the peacocks soon discovered the jays trick, and they said, Look!
On his tail are the feathers that fell from us!
He is a big cheater! They then strode up to him, pecked at him, and plucked away his borrowed feathers.
The jay had no choice but to go back to the other jays.
However, his companions, who had watched his behavior from a distance, were angry at him.
They said, Now you have learned a lesson.
It is not only fine feathers that make fine birds.
The Wolf and the Mastiff.
One night a wolf, who was almost skin and bone, met a fat mastiff.
After the wolf said hello to the big dog, he praised its good looks.
If you like, answered the mastiff, you can get as fat and strong as I am. What do I need to do asked the wolf.
Almost nothing, answered the mastiff.
Then they took a walk together.
As they went along, the wolf noticed a spot on the mastiffs neck.
Whats that mark Oh, nothing special, just the collar I wear when I am tied up. Tied up! cried out the wolf, stopping suddenly.
Do you mean you cant always run around at will Well, not always, but does that matter said the mastiff.
It matters a lot to me, said the wolf, and he ran once more back into his native forest.
Moral: Better to starve free than to be a fat slave.
