Unit 10  Ice-Cream Tasters Have a Sweet Job.
John Harrison has an enviable job in most peoples opinion.
Hes the official taster for Dreyers Grand Ice Cream, one of the best-selling ice-cream brands in the U.S.A. On an average day, Harrison has to sample sixty ice creams at the Dreyers headquarters.
When he isnt doing that, he travels all over the country, buying Dreyers ice cream in supermarkets so that he can carry out spot checks for appearance, texture, and flavor.
But, no matter how wonderful this job may sound, it is actually quite tough.
Its difficult work, requiring discipline, selflessness, and thorough preparation.
Before tasting a sample, Harrison uses his eyes first.
If the ice cream doesnt look attractive, he skips it.
Then, he uses a gold spoon instead of one made of wood, plastic, or other metals.
This is because regular spoons leave an aftertaste that can dull the taste buds.
In addition, the temperature of the ice cream may also influence the tasters taste buds.
If the ice cream is too cold, it will numb the taste buds.
Whats more, ice-cream tasters dont swallow any ice cream while theyre on duty.
When Harrison samples ice cream, he first takes only a small bite of the ice cream, swishes it around in his mouth to introduce it to each of his taste buds, lightly licks his lips, and then gently breathes in so as to bring the smell up through the back of his mouth to his nose.
With each step, he carefully sizes up whether the ice cream conveys the ideal balance between dairy sweetness and the flavor of the added ingredients.
And last of all, no matter what the ice cream tastes like, he spits it out, since a full stomach makes for a dull palate.
For Harrison, keeping a sharp palate means that other sacrifices must also be made: No onions, garlic, or cayenne pepper.
He also doesnt have any caffeine, since this blocks the taste buds.
Thus, he usually has a cup of caffeine-free herbal tea for breakfast in order that his job will not be affected.
But to him, this is just a small price to pay for what he calls the worlds best job.
Harrisons family has been in the ice-cream business for four generations, and Harrison himself has spent almost his whole life in it as well.
Yet, he has never lost his love of the cold, creamy sweetness.
He orders ice cream in restaurants for dessert, even when hes not at work.
On these occasions, he swallows the ice cream, taking in about a liter a week.
Though he has gained some weight over the years hes been with Dreyers, he couldnt care less.
Who would trust a skinny ice-cream taster he jokes.
