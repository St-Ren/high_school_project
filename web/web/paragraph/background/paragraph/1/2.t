I still remember the night before my first day of high school.
I wanted to look perfect on the first day.
After I made sure everything was ready for the next day, I happily went to sleep.
The next morning, I woke up and felt excited, and I ran to the mirror.
When I saw myself in it, I let out a cry, "Oh my God!
How could this happen?"
Right on the tip of my nose was a huge red zit!
I was surprised and upset.
I thought that the zit must have been the work of mean little aliens!
They came to Earth and landed their bright red spaceship right on my nose in order to ruin my first day of high school!
It was terrible to have a nose so ugly that it made Rudolph's nose look normal.
I felt so embarrassed.
I tried to hide my ugly pimple, but nothing I did worked.
I wanted to skip school, but my mom wouldn't let me.
I worried that people at school would see my zit and know me not as the "freshman It girl," but as the "freshman Zit girl!"
It was so depressing!
Fortunately, the day went well, and miraculously no one said anything about my pimple!
But for the rest of the year, I was sure that everyone was talking about my funny-looking zit every day when I was not around.
On the first day of tenth grade, I guessed that no one remembered my old zit anymore and said to my best friend, "It's great for me to be off to such a good start this year."
She replied, "I don't understand."
I pointed at my nose and yelled, "Don't you remember the huge zit I had on the first day of school last year?"
She said, "No, but you must remember my disgusting orange shirt."
I paused and then said, "No, I don't."
Then I realized that most people only care about their own faults and have no time to think about others'.
I can recall all of my embarrassing moments in high school, but even when I try, I can't remember any such moments of my friends'.
Now the zit story has become just a funny memory to me.
It has taught me to be more carefree and to wash my face more often!
