A folktale is a story that one generation passes down to the next by word of mouth.
It is told to amuse, amaze, or teach the listeners.
The story happens in a place and time far distant from that of our lives: "Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom...." Much to one's enjoyment, these tales feature kings and princesses, giants and dragons, fairies and talking animals.
The animals in a folktale not only talk but act like people.
The following is an animal tale from Africa.
Some time ago in the African rain forest, a baby snake set out to play.
As he slid away, his mother sang words of caution:
"Watch out, young son, for things with claws, for things with a beak, for things with strong jaws."
"Claws, beak, jaws.
Claws, beak, jaws," Snake Baby replied.
At the same time, a baby frog set out to play.
As he hopped away, his mother sang words of caution:
"Watch out for the hiss; watch out for the coil; watch out for the squeeze; they will cause turmoil."
"Hiss, coil, squeeze.
Hiss, coil, squeeze," Frog Baby replied.
Snake Baby and Frog Baby met in the rain forest and played the day away.
What good games they played!
First they played Leap Frog.
Then they played Hide and Hug.
That night Frog Baby told Frog Mama about his fun and the games he played.
"No, no, Frog Baby!
Hide and Hug is not a game for you.
It's the game of the hiss, coil, and squeeze.
Promise you'll never play with him again."
Also that night Snake Baby told Snake Mama about his fun and the games he played.
"No, no, Snake Baby!
Hide and Hug is not a game for you.
Hide and Hug is what you must do.
This is the way you get your meals!
Promise me you'll hiss, coil, and squeeze.
It'll feel so good and then your belly will become full"
The next day as Frog Baby set out, he fearfully repeated his words of caution, "Hiss, coil, and squeeze."
But as Snake Baby set out, he happily sang, "Hiss, coil, and squeeze.
Make a meal for me."
Now we know why we never see frogs and snakes playing games together; it is against their natures.
