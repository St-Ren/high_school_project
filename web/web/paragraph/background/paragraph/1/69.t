September 1997 marked the 100th anniversary of the publication of one of the most famous newspaper editorials of all time-an essay which was written to answer an eight-year-old girl's question: "Is there a Santa Claus?"
Like many children, Virginia O'Hanlon of New York City believed in Santa Claus.
But some friends of hers had told her that Santa did not exist.
When she asked her father, he did not give her an answer.
So she told him that she was going to write to The New York Sun, a popular newspaper of that time.
Her father replied, "If you see it in The Sun, it's so."
Virginia's letter was answered by Francis P. Church.
Today, people think his letter is a literary masterpiece.
Church told her, "....
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.
He exists as surely as love and kindness and devotion exist.
You know that they are plentiful and give to your life its highest beauty and joy.
The world would be terribly dreary if there were no Santa Claus!
It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias.
Without Santa, life would be intolerable; there would be no childlike faith, no poetry, no romance.
We should have no joy, except in sense and sight.
The light with which childhood fills the world would turn off."
"Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that does not mean there is no Santa Claus.
The most real things in the world are those that cannot be seen by either children or adults.
Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn?
Of course not, but that's no proof that they are not there.
Nobody can imagine all the wonders that we don't see and we are unable to see in the world."
"Thank God!
He lives, and he lives forever.
A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years from now, he'll always make children happy."
Since the editorial first appeared on September 21, 1897, it has been translated into many languages.
Its fame is due to the hope it gives not only to children but to adults too.
The world has changed in many ways since 1897.
But even today, those timeless words-"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus" -still speak to people who hope that their dreams will come true.
