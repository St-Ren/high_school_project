Colleen Keefe and Shauna Dickey wrote the following letter in memory of their friend, Meghan.
Sadly, Meghan had died in a car crash at the age of sixteen.
Dear Meghan,
Shauna and I had a chance to say goodbye to you last week.
But we still have a long way to go together.
When I heard the news of your leaving us so soon, all I could do was hug my blanket and close my eyes.
I hoped that when I opened them, the nightmare would be gone.
On my way to comfort your mom and dad, I realized I needed to give you a part of me.
It symbolizes our friendship.
So when you are walking around the clouds above, everyone would ask what it means.
So I give to you a piece of my blanket in the shape of a heart.
There is also a picture of the three of us-you, Shauna, and me.
We three enjoyed taking photos, and this one is our favorite.
This blanket was given to me by my grandfather.
He is in heaven with you.
He will recognize the blanket.
He might not recognize my picture because he has been gone for over fourteen years.
He gave this to me to keep me warm, and now I give it to you to keep you warm.
And don't be afraid when he stops you and talks in that big deep voice.
Give him a big hug and a kiss for me, and tell him I said to take care of you.
Now that we know you are taken care of, we can move on with our lives.
We will always remember you, and as Shauna and I know you are looking down on us, we are sure we will make you laugh in our usual silly, clumsy way.
So keep smiling, for that is how we remember you.
We found out that one of the recipients of your organ donation is doing well.
Even in your death, you have helped others.
Goodbye, my friend, we miss you already.
Give us a nudge when we are heading in the wrong direction and, of course, keep "dancing."
Shauna wants you to say hi to Elvis for her.
He's probably in the food court.
Every time I wrap my blanket around me, I will feel your presence.
Stay warm.
Colleen Keefe and Shauna Dickey
