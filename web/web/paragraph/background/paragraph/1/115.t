In the mid-1990s, two language researchers did an interesting experiment with a group of English-language students in Japan.
These students were retaking the English courses they had previously failed.
On language tests, these students were far behind the regular university students.
Since most of these students disliked studying English, few expected much improvement.
The researchers put these students in a special class for the second semester of the English course.
The class met for the same amount of time as the regular English courses, but the way the class was taught was very different.
At the end of the semester, the students took another language test and the results were surprising.
In just one semester, the students in the special class had improved so much that their scores on the new test were almost as high as those of the regular English students.
In addition, these students, who had been afraid of English, started to enjoy the class.
What was this secret method that produced such surprising results with these previously reluctant learners?
The class was an extensive reading course.
Extensive reading is simply reading a lot of English at a fairly easy level.
The students in the course spent almost all of their class time simply reading enjoyable books.
In study after study, researchers are finding that extensive reading can play a big role in language learning success.
In fact, one study found that reading for pleasure and seeking opportunities to read in English are the two factors most strongly related to successful language learning.
Extensive reading allows students to see the language in context over and over again, giving them the exposure they need to understand, organize, remember, and use it.
It builds vocabulary and grammar knowledge.
In short, extensive reading provides a very strong foundation for all language skill.
