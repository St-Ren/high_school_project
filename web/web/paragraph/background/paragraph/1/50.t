The Power of Advertising.
Advertising is everywhere.
Do you know how it affects you?
Advertising messages bombard you from everywhere.
You see them or hear them every time you turn on the TV or listen to the radio.
Whenever you open a newspaper or surf the Internet, theyre there, too.
Ads cover billboards, sides of buses and buildings.
Its impossible to count the number of advertisements you see every day.
One organization in America tried.
The organization estimated that by the time Americans are sixty-five, they have seen two million TV commercials.
Add other advertising to that, and you realize just how many ads people see.
Advertising tries to convince you to buy a particular product or service.
Some ads are so creative and persuasive that you cant help buying the product!
The more often you see an ad, the more familiar you become with the product.
You find yourself remembering the slogans, catchphrases and jingles of advertisements.
When you do, you may be more likely to buy those products.
Does it work?
Companies pay a lot of money to advertising firms to think up catchy phrases that people cant get out of their heads.
Even years later, people remember the slogans and jingles.
American Express credit cards remind you to Never leave home without it. McDonalds wants you to think Im lovin it when you eat their sandwiches.
Pepsi belongs to Generation Next And Nike wants consumers to Just do it. The power of advertising cant be underestimated, especially on children.
By the time children are six, they know two hundred brand names.
They will be loyal to many of them for life.
In advertising, slogans and jingles sell products and so do famous faces.
Companies think you will use their products if celebrities tell you they do.
As a result, companies pay millions of dollars to sports stars, pop stars and movie stars to endorse their products.
Nicole Kidman promotes Chanel No.
5 perfume.
Tiger Woods drives a Buick, and Celine Dion, a Chrysler.
Even Jackie Chan wants you to wear Hanes T-shirts just like he does.
Whatever method they use, advertisements are meant to encourage you to buy products.
They want to convince you that their product will make you happier or better looking.
Think about the people you see in ads.
Almost all of them are attractive and are usually smiling.
But the subtle message that things make you happy simply isnt true.
If you believe it, youll end up spending more and more money.
Youll find yourself searching for the elusive happiness the ads promise but the products dont deliver.
People need to know how advertisers use images and language to get them to buy their products.
After seeing an ad, people should think critically.
They should ask questions such as the following: What ways are used to get my attention What values and points of view are presented in the message Do I need this product Thinking critically about an advertisement will reduce the pressure to buy.
You may have to look at advertisements, but you dont have to buy what they sell.
