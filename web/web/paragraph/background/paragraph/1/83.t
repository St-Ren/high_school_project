I grew up in a little community in the south of Spain.
I was 16 when one morning, my father told me I could drive him to a small village about 18 miles away, if I would take the car in to be serviced at a nearby garage.
I was happy to take him because I had just learned to drive and rarely had the chance to use the car.
I drove Dad to the village and promised to pick him up at 4 p.m. Then I drove to a nearby garage and dropped off the car.
I decided to catch a movie or two at a theater near the garage while the car was serviced.
However, I became so immersed in the films that I lost track of time.
When the last movie had finished, I looked down at my watch.
It was six oclock.
I was two hours late!
I knew Dad would be angry if he found out I had been watching movies.
He would never let me drive again.
I decided to tell him that the car needed some repairs and that they had taken longer than had been expected.
I drove up to the place where we had planned to meet and saw Dad waiting patiently around the corner.
I apologized for being late and told him that I had come as quickly as I could, but the car had needed some major repairs.
I will never forget the look he gave me.
Im disappointed that you feel you have to lie to me, Jason.
What do you mean?
Im telling the truth.
Dad looked at me again.
When you didnt show up, I called the garage to ask if there were any problems, and they told me that you hadnt yet picked up the car.
So, I know there were no problems with the car. A feeling of guilt ran through me as I confessed the real reason for being late.
Dad listened sadly.
Im angry, not with you but with myself.
You see, I realize that I have failed as a father.
After all these years, you feel that you have to lie to
Im going to walk home now and contemplate
where I have gone wrong.
But Dad, its 18 miles to home.
cannot walk home.
He would not listen.
I had let my father down, and I was about to learn one of the most painful lessons of my life.
Dad began walking along the dusty roads.
I quickly jumped in the car and followed behind, hoping he would give up.
I begged all the way, telling him how sorry I was, but he ignored me.
For 18 miles I drove behind him, averaging about five miles per hour.
Seeing my father in so much physical and emotional pain was the most distressing and difficult experience that I have ever faced.
However, it was also the most successful lesson.
I have never lied to him ever since.
