Every culture associates certain meanings with colors.
For example, in English-speaking societies, the color blue is linked to sorrow, green is considered envy, and yellow is connected with cowardice.
However, in some cases, the same color has obviously different meanings in different cultures.
Some interesting examples include red, black and white, which are seen differently by western and Chinese societies in terms of their meanings.
In Chinese culture, the color red is thought to stand for good fortune and happiness.
Therefore, this color is often seen in weddings, New Year's celebrations, and festivities surrounding the birth of a new baby.
While red is generally given a positive meaning in Chinese culture, in western culture it typically has negative meanings.
This color is closely linked to anger (as in the expression"seeing red") and embarrassment (as in the idiom"red in the face").
In soccer, a player who breaks a major rule is given a"red card"and taken out of the game.
Another interesting example of how red is given a more positive meaning in Chinese than in western culture can be observed in the way the color is used in business.
In Chinese stock markets, increases in share values are marked in red, while losses are indicated in green.
The opposite is true in western stock markets, where dropping stock prices are marked in red.
In fact, the English expression"in the red"means that a company is losing money, while being"in the black"means that profits are being made.
There are also major differences between the two cultures in the way they see black and white.
In the western world, black is the color of mourning and is worn at funerals by both men and women.
In Chinese culture, on the other hand, it is the color white that traditionally has this role, although black is sometimes worn on such occasions nowadays as well.
At a traditional funeral, mourners are usually dressed in white and give white envelopes with money inside to the dead person's family.
In most western cultures, on the other hand, white is associated with purity.
That's why new brides wear this color on their wedding day nowadays, though the brides in the past used to wear green, which stood for fertility, or other colors.
There is more to color than meets the eye.
The next time you are at some kind of ceremony or other special events, look at the colors all around you and think about the special meanings some of them may have.
