Unit 5  Blame It on the Brain.
Jim and I got into another fight over the mess he made in the living room again!
I was trembling with rage after he told me to stop nagging. With his arms crossed, he said that he had been stressed out and needed some silence.
I stood still next to the sofa and waited for an apology from him.
However, I almost hit the roof because he just sat there and kept changing channels.
Shortly afterward I called my best friend Nicole to complain about it, but she only laughed and said, Oh, just give Jim a break.
Men and women are different.
Its almost like theyre from different planets.
Actually, Ive learned a lot about men from two famous relationship experts.
One is Mark Gungor, and the other is Dr. Amen. Frankly, at first I wasnt going to believe anything Nicole said about those experts.
In my eyes, relationship experts only choose facts that support their theories, I said.
However, after speaking with Nicole, I went online and watched some clips of these experts.
They talked humorously about gender differences, and they both communicated one important messageXmens and womens brains simply work differently.
According to Gungor, there are many small boxes in mens brains, and one of them is named the Nothing Box. When men are under stress, they go to the Nothing Box to relax.
Thus, it is not necessary for most men to talk about their problems with friends.
Gungors claim amazed me because sharing feelings is so important to women, especially when were in bad moods.
I couldnt wait to learn more!
After viewing some more clips, I had learned a lot about Dr. Amens brain scans of both sexes.
On the whole, women have larger and more active emotional centers than men do.
In other words, women are more likely to be affected by emotions than men are.
I couldnt help but have a chuckle.
No wonder every time Jim and I have a quarrel, I always cry in the end.
Amen also adds that since mens brains are less active, men need more excitement and stimulation.
For that reason, they may unconsciously keep surfing channels for something new and different.
Well, I guessed I would have to forgive Jim for always doing that.
I turned off the computer and stepped back into the living room.
Much to my surprise, the living room had been tidied up!
A thought struck meXmaybe it is true that men and women come from different planets, but fortunately, my husband attempted to bridge the gap.
Though Jim never said he was sorry, he apologized in his own way.
That night, Jim hugged me with his head tilting toward me as we watched TV.
