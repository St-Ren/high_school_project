Unit 7  The Power of the Press.
Freedom of the press is rightly protected in most democratic societies, yet it is just this protection that sometimes allows this freedom to be made bad use of.
The press has a strong influence which can bring about significant changes to the lives of ordinary people, and sometimes even bring down a government.
Stories about individual people tend to attract far more public attention than political events do.
To increase the sales of their newspaper or magazine, journalists may try every means to explore these stories.
Thus, they can easily cause individuals great inconvenience by visiting them frequently and publishing details of their private lives.
The story of the first quintuplets in America clearly illustrated the power of the press.
There was a poor family living in Aberdeen, a small town in the U.S.A. Raising five children in conditions of poverty was already a struggle for the parents of this family.
When the pregnant mother learned that it was another four girls and one more boy that were on the way, she and her husband were shocked beyond belief.
Without a doubt, they were going to face even more urgent economic problems.
Nonetheless, this event changed their lives in ways they had never expected.
The day after the birth of the five babies, there were sixty reporters and photographers waiting outside their door.
The couple soon made national headlines, for they had become the parents of the first quintuplets in America.
The family gained fame and fortune overnight.
Newspapers and magazines offered them huge sums of money for exclusive rights to publish their stories as well as their photos.
Gifts poured in not only from unknown people, but also from baby food and soap manufacturers who wanted to advertise their products.
Though their lives were indeed improved, reporters kept pressing for interviews, which forced the family to hire lawyers to act as spokespeople for them at news conferences.
Moreover, the birth also brought great changes to Aberdeen.
Plans for a new highway were developed, since this town was likely to attract thousands of visitors.
Even the name of the town on the road signs was changed to Quint-City, U.S.A. Locals also discussed the possibility of setting up a quint museum to satisfy the curiosity of the public and to protect the family from gossipy visitors at the same time.
While the babies were still quietly sleeping in the hospital, their parents began paying the price for fame.
It would never again be possible for them to lead normal lives.
The town itself received so much attention that almost each of the residents there was affected to a certain extent.
This was the power of the press, but such power could easily be misapplied.
