Interesting Experiments: Not All Bubbles Are Made with Soap.
Doing chemical experiments is not as boring as many people think.
In fact, it can be a lot of fun, as the following two experiments show.
Balloon Blow-Up
What Do I Need?
A bottle with a narrow neck
Baking soda
Funnel or straw
What Do I Do?
1 Pour about an inch of liquidXhalf vinegar, half waterXinto the bottle.
2 Use the funnel to fill the balloon half full of baking soda.
(If you dont have a funnel, you can use a straw to load the balloon.
Stick the straw into the baking soda, and put your finger over the top of the straw.
Lift the straw out, put it into the balloon, and blow or tap gently.)
3 Stretch the open end of the balloon over the neck of the bottle.
Make sure its on tight!
Let the heavy end of the balloon dangle so no baking soda goes in the bottle.
Hold onto the balloon at the bottle neck, and pick up the heavy part of the balloon so that all the baking soda falls into the vinegar at the bottom of the bottle.
Hear the fizz?
There are thousands of bubbles!
And look at whats happening to the balloon.

What Do I Need?
For more bubble fun youll need:
A can of clear soda (e.g., 7-Up, ginger ale)
What Do I Do?
Get a can of clear soda and shake it as hard as you can.
Knock sharply on the top two or three times.
Now open it.
Or give it to a grown-up to open, if you dare.
Watch out!
(This may be messy, so do it over the sink or outside.)
What happens?
What did you expect?
Fantastic Feats of Fizz
Now that your can of soda is open, pour it into a glass.
Drop in five or six small raisins.
Watch tiny bubbles form all over them.
In a minute or so, the raisins will start to wiggle around and dance.
Then theyll float up to the top of the soda.
After a minute, theyll sink back down again.
If you tap on the side of glass, theyll sink right away.
How long will they keep dancing?
