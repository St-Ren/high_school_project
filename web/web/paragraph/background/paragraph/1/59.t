The Bermuda Triangle---A Modern Mystery.
The Bermuda Triangle---sometimes called the Devils Triangle---is an area between Bermuda, Florida, and Puerto Rico.
It is well-known for the unexplained disappearance in the area of several hundred ships, aircraft, and people.
In most cases, the victims have vanished without warning in seconds, and often in good weather.
Wreckage and bodies are almost never recovered.
Strange events in the area go as far back as Christopher Columbus, who in 1492 saw strange lights in the sky there.
The name Bermuda Triangle, however, was not used until 1964 when it appeared in an article by Vincent H. Gaddis in the magazine Argosy.
In 1918, the U.S. Navy ship Cyclops, and all three hundred people on board, disappeared completely.
In 1941, two more U.S. ships, the Proteus and the Nereus, both vanished traveling from the Virgin Islands to the U.S.A.
Many other vessels have been lost, including the nuclear-powered submarine Scorpion, with a crew of ninety-nine, which disappeared in 1968.
But perhaps the most famous of all disappearances has been Flight 19.
In 1945, five U.S. Navy planes and their fourteen crewmen vanished.
A rescue plane sent to find them vanished, too.
Much larger aircraft also have disappeared, including a Super Constellation in 1954 with forty-two passengers aboard.
An Air Force KB-50 tanker with eight crew members vanished in 1962.
There are many theories about why so many planes and ships have been lost in this area.
It is known that compasses in this region often give false readings because of natural changes in the earths magnetic field.
This can lead to human error.
This also happens in an area named the Devils Sea off the east coast of Japan.
This area also is famous for disappearances of ships and planes.
In addition, the weather in the Bermuda Triangle can be very unpredictable, and thunderstorms are a hazard.
However, many of the disappearances have happened very suddenly.
Some people suggest strange forces such as alien abductions and time warps in the skies, and others say the lost city of Atlantis is in the region and that this has a mysterious power that causes the disasters.
Whatever the cause, one thing is certain: the Bermuda Triangle remains a great modern mystery.
