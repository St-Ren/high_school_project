Country Music.
Country music is very old.
It came from the United States, Canada, Ireland, and Great Britain.
Country music is a mixture of music from all of these places.
In the American West, cowboys had to take care of the cattle.
They had to watch them all day and all night because the cattle were nervous and sometimes ran away.
A cowboys life was lonely and dangerous.
When he was alone in the desert with the cattle, he drank strong coffee with lots of caffeine to stay awake at night.
He also sang to the cattle to calm them.
He sang about the stars and the moon, about his family and his friends.
The cattle listened to the cowboy and went to sleep.
They did not run away if he sang beautiful, peaceful music.
The cowboys played music either on guitars or on harmonicas.
Later, they used violins and other instruments.
In the American South, many people came from Ireland, Scotland, and England.
Other people came from French Canada.
They enjoyed their own kind of music.
They used guitars, violins, and harmonicas, too.
However, they also added instruments from their homes, like bottles, cans, and spoons.
Country music describes life.
It talks about love, jobs, home, and money.
It also talks about friends and enemies, trucks and highways, farms and crops.
People in many parts of the world like country music because everyone knows something about these things.
When it comes to songs, it would be difficult to really understand or even enjoy them without listening to both the words and the music.
The following is a classic country song.
Why not put on some cowboy clothes like many country music fans do and sing it?
You will certainly have a better understanding of the music.
Who knows?
You may even fall in love with it.
Take Me Home, Country Roads
by John Denver
Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue ridge mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Blowing like a breeze
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads
All my memories gather round her
Miners lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads
I hear her voice, in the morning hours she calls me
Radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling
That I shouldve been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads
