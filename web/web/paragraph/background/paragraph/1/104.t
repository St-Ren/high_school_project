Unit 6  Lets Dig In!
Fried insects are regarded as a delicious dish in some parts of the worldXjust as roast mice make a perfect meal in other parts.
Many of us, however, would turn down these foods.
Similarly, horse meat that is served as a delicacy in certain areas of France might never be acceptable to most Americans, even those who are so hungry that they could eat a horse.
What makes people choose certain foods over others, then?
After digging into this issue, experts have discovered several factors.
Among these factors, customs as well as traditions are the major ones, and so is geography.
Customs and traditions play important roles in peoples choices of foods.
In Japan, lobster is considered essential for a birthday meal because a lobster looks like an aged person with a hunched back.
Another example of this can be found in Greece.
On New Years Day, Greeks bake a special type of bread containing a coin made of silver or gold.
The person who finds the coin in his or her piece of bread will be blessed with good luck for the coming year.
Likewise, on Chinese New Years Eve, many Chinese gather around the table with their family members to make and eat dumplings.
A dumpling looks like a yuanbao, which was a type of money used in ancient China.
A yuanbao represents wealth and satisfaction in Chinese culture.
Therefore, many believe that making dumplings is helpful in making more money, and so is eating dumplings.
This is one of the things that Chinese people do to try to insure a prosperous year.
In addition to customs and traditions, geography is another important factor that influences peoples food choices.
Take millet, for example.
It is one of Africas main crops because it flourishes in hot climates.
This is exactly the reason why millet can also be found in certain Asian countries where the average temperature tends to be high.
In contrast, the cold climate close to the North Pole drives the Inuit to get the fat and protein they need from the blubber of whales.
The potato is a classic example, too.
It is a staple in many peoples diets, especially those who live in mountainous areas with poor soil.
The potato adapts itself well to different climates; therefore, it is often grown in many European countries, and is even thought of as second bread.
In most cases, people choose to eat some foods and not to eat other foods for specific understandable reasons.
Actually, complex factors often lead to different food choices.
Keep this in mind if you have the opportunity to visit Sweden and taste soured herring.
Better still, try to find out the origin of this Swedish specialty.
What you discover may keep you from losing your appetiteXif you are able to put up with its unique smell!
