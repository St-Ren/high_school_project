ORBIS is an international organization devoted to preventing and curing blindness worldwide.
The word "orbis" means "eye" in Latin.
The organization has a very unusual airplane-the "Flying Eye Hospital."
The plane's mission is to help blind people see again.
The loss of sight is a tragic blow to an individual and has a great impact on his or her family.
People often feel hopeless when they become blind.
The good news is that 7 percent of all blindness can be cured.
The problem is that there are not enough well-trained doctors in many remote areas.
ORBIS tries to solve this problem by reaching out to those places and providing training for the doctors there.
The Flying Eye Hospital has the most advanced equipment and operating rooms.
When it stops at a place, the doctors on board give operations to some patients.
A video camera sends clear pictures of the operation to the ground.
The local doctors can watch and learn advanced operating skills.
In places where the aircraft cannot land, ORBIS also has training programs in local hospitals.
To date, more than twenty million blind people have benefited from ORBIS, and the number is still growing.
ORBIS has permanent programs in several countries.
ORBIS Taiwan is one of the sixteen ORBIS International offices.
A number of volunteer eye doctors from Taiwan have been working on board the Flying Eye Hospital.
They join doctors from around the world to help the blind, giving them the chance to see the blue sky, the green grass, the red flowers, and the smiling faces of their relatives.
