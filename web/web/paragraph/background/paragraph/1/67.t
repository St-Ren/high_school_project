The Earth is getting warmer because people are adding gases to the
environment that trap heat.
Many scientists regard burning too much fossil
fuel as one of the main causes of global warming.
As global temperatures rise, our climate and our environment change greatly.
People, animals, and our living environment are experiencing the consequences of these changes  in many ways.
The extreme weather may be the most serious result of climate change.
Snowstorms and heatwaves are examples.
In recent years, thousands of people in Europe and North America were hurt, made ill, and even killed because of the extremely high or low temperatures.
An increase of droughts and floods also damages food production and causes serious illness in Asia and Africa.
"Can we do something to lessen the impact of climate change?"
Many people ask this question.
In Taiwan, people have taken action.
For example, there are new laws to push for developing green and clean energy such as wind and solar power.
The new policies aim to reduce the use of fossil fuels and carbon emissions.
Electric scooters and bikes are also more and more popular.
People hope to slow down the climate change by releasing less carbon and heat into the air.
When people view the climate change as a serious thing, they understand that dealing with climate change is not an easy job.
Everyone has to work together for the living environment.
Adopting new lifestyles with less carbon emissions can be a very good start.
We believe that everyone's goodwill for the Earth will bring us a better world.
