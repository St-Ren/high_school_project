The Daffodils is one of the best-known poems of the English language.
It was written by William Wordsworth in 1804.
Wordsworth was inspired by a long belt of daffodils that he and his sister, Dorothy, found during a walk on April 15, 1802.
However, the beauty of the daffodils did not strike him until much later.
It was on a day when he was feeling sad and lonely that he remembered the daffodils, and that cheered him up considerably.
Dorothy later wrote to her brother about this walk: I have never seen such beautiful daffodils.
Some rested their heads upon mossy stones as if they were pillows, and others tossed and danced and seemed to be laughing with the wind that blew upon them over the lake.
They looked so gay, dancing and changing all the time.
William Wordsworth was inspired by what his sister wrote and composed this famous poem shortly after that, as shown in the following.
I WANDERED LONELY AS A CLOUD
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high oer vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils,
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee;
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company;
I gazed V and gazed V but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:
For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
