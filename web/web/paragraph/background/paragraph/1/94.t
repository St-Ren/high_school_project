Unit 8  The Long-Haired Spirits and the Thao.
Sun Moon Lake, which is located in the center of Taiwan, is known for its natural beauty.
The Thao, one of Taiwans indigenous tribes, live nearby.
A legend about longhaired spirits has been passed on to Thao children from generation to generation.
For centuries, the longhaired spirits had lived at the bottom of Sun Moon Lake, and they had shared the fish in the lake with the Thao.
One day, a group of Thao fishermen found that their fishing nets had been seriously damaged, but no one knew the reason for this.
They could only tell that the number of fish in their nets was sharply decreasing.
Thus, the Thao began to worry about their future.
Numa, a strong Thao hero, volunteered to go into the lake to find out the cause of it.
After he jumped into the water, he headed directly for its deepest area and came upon the answer thereXa longhaired spirit was destroying the Thaos fishing nets.
Numa swam quickly toward it and tried to stop it from tearing more of the nets.
The two then had a fierce fight underwater for three days.
Finally, the spirit spoke, Listen to me, you foolish man!
I would rather lose my life today than let your people bring destruction on all of us! The spirit continued, In the past, there were enough fish in the lake for both of us.
However, you humans have been blinded by your greed!
With the large number of small-mesh nets you use, you are emptying the lake of its fish.
Dont you know that once the fish in the lake are gone, we will all die of hunger?
When Numa heard the spirits warning, he was shocked and embarrassed at what the Thao had done.
It dawned on him that the lake had supported his tribe for generations.
He made peace with the long-haired spirit before he returned to his tribe.
Numa then told the tribes elders what had happened in the lake, and they made a wise decision: The Thao would catch just enough fish to eat instead of letting their greed lead them to destruction.
To avoid catching baby fish, the Thao no longer used small-mesh nets from then on.
Therefore, the fish in the lake wouldnt become extinct.
The Thao chose to listen to the spirits voice that called for harmony with nature, and they came to realize that they could wisely use the natural resources they had been blessed with.
