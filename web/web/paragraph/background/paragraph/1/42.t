Understanding Your Dreams.
Do you know we spend about one third of our lives sleeping?
During that time, we are also dreaming.
While dreaming, we can interact with different people, places, and things.
Below are the meanings of some common dreams that people have.
Im Naked!
Clothes are a means of hiding yourself.
Without them, everything is there for all to see.
You are left without any defenses.
A dream in which you are naked may be telling you that you are trying to be something you really are not, or that you are afraid of being laughed at and made fun of.
Im Being Chased!
Chase dreams often come from some anxiety in your life.
Often in these dreams, you are being pursued by someone who wants to hurt or kill you.
You are running away, hiding, or trying to outwit your pursuer.
Ask yourself who is the one chasing you, and you might discover the source of your fear or sense of pressure.
Im Flying!
Many dreamers have described the ability to fly in their dreams as an experience of joy and freedom.
The ability to control your flight shows your sense of power.
Having trouble staying in flight shows a lack of power in controlling your own life situation.
Things like power lines, trees, and mountains may block your flight.
They are like barriers that are standing in your way in your waking life.
Im Falling!
Falling dreams are a common theme in the world of dreams.
These dreams obviously express your basic human fear of heights, the anxiety you feel when you stand near the edge of a high place.
They may reflect the way you feel in a relationship.
Falling dreams can also express your fear of failing in your job or in school, or your fear of falling in status.
I Failed the Test!
Such dreams reflect your anxiety.
You may find that you cannot answer any of the questions on a test.
Is time running out?
Are you late for the exam?
Does your pencil keep breaking?
These dreams usually have to do with your self-esteem and confidence.
You are worried that you are not meeting other peoples expectations of you.
Dreams can help us discover our deepest secrets or hidden feelings.
But five minutes after the end of a dream, half of its content is forgotten.
After ten minutes, 90 percent is lost.
So if you want to understand your dreams, youd better have a good memory!
