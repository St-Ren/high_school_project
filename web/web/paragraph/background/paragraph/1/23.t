"Only let this one teardrop, this Taj Mahal, glisten spotlessly bright on the cheek of time, forever and ever."
This was the way that the Indian poet Tagore praised India's famous monument, the Taj Mahal.
This was also the poet's sigh when he thought of Emperor Jahan and his lasting love for his wife.
The moment you enter the Hindu-touch gateway, a raised marble watercourse comes into sight.
Looking down to the end of it, you see a pure white marble mausoleum.
It stands seventy-six meters high, bathed in milky white sunlight.
Its reflection lies glassy in the water.
It is so beautiful that you can't take your eyes off it.
The perfectly symmetrical, Persian-style garden is divided into sixteen flowerbeds.
At the end of the 1-meter watercourse is the main structure, whose Muslim design and fine decorations are really amazing.
Inside the building, the tombs of Emperor Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal take the tourists back three hundred years to the time of the most touching love story.
When Emperor Jahan was only fifteen, he fell in love with Mumtaz at first sight.
After that, he loved no lady except her.
The two were inseparable companions-Mumtaz traveled everywhere and overcame every difficulty with him.
She was such a perfect wife that he named her"Jewel of the Palace."
But sadly, while giving birth to their fourteenth child, she died suddenly at the age of thirty-eight.
Legend has it that the emperor cried out in sorrow like a ship tossed by a terrible storm.
He hid himself from the public for a year.
Returning to public life, Emperor Jahan ordered the construction of the most magnificent monument in memory of his wife.
The construction took twenty-two years.
It was a labor of love on the part of the grieving husband.
The emperor had no concern for anything else.
After the completion of the Taj, Jahan fell sick and was faced with an even sadder fate.
His son put him under house arrest.
He was locked in a room where no one was allowed to visit him.
All he could do was cast his eyes on the Taj Mahal, thinking about his late wife.
He became weaker with time and died eight years later.
To many tourists, the Taj Mahal is simply a world-famous building.
It is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site and a"Wonder of the World."
Yet to some, it is a place to silently reflect on a very old, very sad, yet also very beautiful love story.
