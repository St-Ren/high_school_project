I am an astronaut working in the International Space Station.
My daily routine is quite unique because I work 2 miles above the Earth, where the gravity is close to zerothe so-called "microgravity."
My main jobs are doing scientific experiments, changing machine parts and keeping the spaceship clean, and I carry out all of them while floating in the air!
Microgravity not only adds a twist to my work, but also makes other aspects of my daily life different from that of other scientists down on Earth.
Food is as important in space as it is on Earth.
Yet most of us experience loss of appetite at the beginning of our days in space because our bodies are trying to get used to a completely new environment.
Besides, food doesn't taste as good up here, so seasonings such as salt and pepper are a nice addition to space meals.
But they must come in liquid form rather than in the form of powders, which may float around and get stuck in the vents.
Exercise is another must-do.
Our muscles don't need to support our bodies, which weigh nothing in microgravity, so they may shrink.
To prevent our muscles from shrinking, we need to exercise two hours a day on specially designed bikes and running machines, or do weight training by pulling tight ropes that are fixed to the wall on one end.
After our stomachs are full and exercise is completed, we need to clean ourselves before bedtime.
The idea that we take showers every day doesn't work here.
The supply of water is limited, so we only take showers from time to time.
They are taken inside a large plastic capsule so that no water gets away.
After the shower, we turn on a machine that sucks up all the water.
On no-shower days, we clean our skin with wet towels or a special soap that doesn't need to be washed off.
After many hours of work, there is nothing like a nice, long rest.
To avoid floating around, we shut ourselves in a special space about the size of a phone booth, and attach our sleeping bags to the wall.
This way, we won't bump into each other in our sleep, or wake up in the restroom!
Living in space is a unique experience.
Having gone through hundreds of hours of simulation during training down on Earth, we are still amazed when we first get up here.
In fact, the feeling of amazement never really goes away.
Living and working like this is sometimes difficult, but most of the time it is enjoyable!
