She had no job.
She was a single mother, living in a small apartment with her baby daughter.
Life was hard.
Now, she is a great success.
Children and adults buy her books all over the world- in thirty languages.
It seems her books win awards and break records almost every day.
Who is she?
J. K. Rowling-the woman who wrote the Harry Potter Stories.
What is the secret of her success?
STEP 1 : Do something that you enjoy.
Rowling says she wrote Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone- the first book in the series- because she wanted a challenge.
She wanted to achieve something special.
She likes writing.
In fact, she wrote her first book (called Rabbit) when she was six years old.
Perhaps this is the first reason for her success- she chose to do something that she enjoyed.
But how did she become such a great success?
Well, in 1992, Rowling left her job in England and went to Portugal.
She moved to Portugal to have more time to do what she loved most- write.
She worked as an English teacher.
She used her free time in the mornings to write Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone.
STEP 2 : Follow your dream.
She got married, but later divorced.
She returned home to the U.K. with her baby daughter Jessica.
She lived in Edinburgh in Scotland.
She lived in a very small, cold apartment.
Life as a single mother was hard, but she was determined to finish writing Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone.
She wrote mostly in cafes and while her daughter was asleep.
She had no money for a computer or typewriter-she used a pen and paper.
When things became difficult, she didnt forget her goal, and she didnt stop working.
STEP 3 : Never give up.
The road to success was hard for Rowling, but eventually she succeeded.
Her advice to people who want success is simple: Try your best.
If you really want to succeed, then you will.
Be prepared to make mistakes- learn from them.
You have to be strong, and never give up.
Sounds simple, doesnt it?
