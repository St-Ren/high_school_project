In Taiwan, people have two very special and different ways of celebrating the Lantern Festival.In the north, they send thousands of sky lanterns into the night sky, creating a beautiful and peaceful scene of lights floating up toward the heavens.
Down south, millions of firecrackers are set off in the streets.
The mood is much wilder, with tens of thousands of people running, jumping, and screaming as they try to escape one missile after another.
People who join the Sky Lantern Festival, held in Pinghsi, say they are very moved as they watch the big paper lanterns float away, higher and higher into the sky.
Some even feel as if they are sharing a special gift with the rest of the world.
To make this gift more special, they often write messages or wishes on the lanterns before they are launched.
Thus, it seems the mood of the festival is much the same as when it first started in the 19th century.
At that time, there were many bandits that traveled around the countryside, especially during the Chinese New Year.
People were so afraid of them that they often left their homes and hid in the mountains.
When the bandits were gone, the village leaders would send lanterns into the sky to tell everyone it was safe to return.
The lanterns were a sign of peace in the village.
Nowadays, even as the festival gets bigger and more popular every year, this idea has not been lost.
For example, in 1999, after the 921 earthquake in Taiwan, festival organizers asked people who were launching lanterns to pray for the earthquake victims and for world peace.
The feeling down south in Yenshui, on the other hand, is completely different!
Instead of prayers for peace, it looks like war games are taking place!
Many people come to the festival fully prepared for danger.
They wear helmets, face masks, and heavy clothing to protect themselves from the firecrackers, which shoot out in all directions on downtown streets.
Even with all this protection, some people still end up getting hurt.
Sometimes their clothing or hair catches fire, or they are pushed down by the crowd.
Although the festival originally started in the 19th century as a means to protect people from danger and disease, it seems now that the sense of danger is what the festival is all about.
Some even say that getting hit by firecrackers is a good sign from the heavens.
These are certainly two very different faces of the Lantern Festival.
So, whichever appeals to your personality, you can head either north or south this year to join in the fun and festivities!
