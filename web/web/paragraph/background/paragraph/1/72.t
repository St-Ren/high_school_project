Goal setting has been defined as the process of deciding the level
of performance we want to reach.
Most of us have goals in many areas: academic, social, and personal.
Some goals are short-term, others are medium-term, and still others are long-term.
For example, a high school freshman who is interested in journalism might set his or her long-term goal on becoming the editor of a college newspaper.
For a short-term goal, the student might decide to finish reading five books in a month.
A medium-term goal would be to become an editor of
the high school newspaper.
By setting shorter-term goals, the student finds
a plan of action to follow to reach his or her long-term goal.
Therefore, the
student gains a sense of accomplishment while he or she is moving closer to
the long-term goal.
This is the reason why setting shorter-term goals is the
key to the success in ones life.
Goal setting is a planning process and an important part of planning our lives.
However, although goals help encourage our actions, just setting them will not get the whole job done.
We still have to work hard to accomplish
Setting goals is only the first step in the process of becoming a more successful person.
Goals help us become aware of our values and help us decide what we want to do.
Think about your goals.
Do your goals motivate you in a positive way to be a successful learner or do your goals motivate you to just get by, and do as little work as possible?
The following is a students reflection about his experience with goal setting.
A Students Reflection
In the past, I never really gave much thought to developing personal goals.
My dad always told me to set my standards high, and
if I put my mind to something, I could do anything.
I never believed this, but I do now.
Setting goals is something that I need to do so
that I know where I want to go and how I can get there.
friend who wrote down five goals that he would like to accomplish
this semester and put them up on the wall of his room.
saw this, I thought to myself: Wow, he knows what he wants
to accomplish. I want to do well in school, but I do not have any specific goals!
I want to set goals so I have a way of showing myself that I have accomplished something.
I feel better about myself when
I accomplish something that I set out to do.
After reading his experience with goal setting, are you ready to set your own?
