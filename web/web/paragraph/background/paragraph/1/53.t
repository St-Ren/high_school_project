Feeding the World in the Future.
Today there are six billion people on earth.
By the year 2050 there may be as many as 12.5 billion, which is a lot of people to feed.
Can farmers all over the world provide enough food for everyone?
The Western world's answer to the question is to use technology to produce food more quickly.
This approach has been very successful.
Since 1961, farmers in the West have produced nearly a quarter more food per person, and they have produced it at a cost 40 percent lower than before.
The foods they are producing include wheat, corn, and rice.
These are important because they represent half of all the food we eat in the world.
One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants.
For thousands of years, farmers have tried to make their crops stronger.
Every season, they pick the strongest and healthiest plants for the next season.
But this method works very slowly.
Since 1983, however, scientists have been able to develop stronger plants more quickly by changing their genetic material.
Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods, or GM foods.
These GM foods, many people believe, are the best answer to feeding the worlds growing population.
Some GM plants may have other advantages as well.
They may also be able to help fight human diseases.
A kind of rice is being developed, for example, which may help prevent some people from going blind.
GM foods are being welcomed by both rich and poor countries.
Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and because they can bring in more money.
Poor countries are interested in them because they can be used to feed many people.
China is already growing thousands of hectares of GM foods, and African countries are beginning to grow them as well.
However, GM plants are not perfect.
Many people believe they are unnatural.
Some even think they could harm us.
In one experiment, genetic material from a snowdrop, a kind of flower, was added to a potato plant to help the plant fight disease.
The potatoes were later fed to rats and the rats became ill. Did they become ill because of the GM food they ate?
No one knows for sure.
No one knows how good or bad these foods may be for human beings.
There is another problem with GM plants.
They are not built to live through all kinds of changes.
The weather and climate can change, for example.
Sometimes, a whole crop of wheat may fail if the winter suddenly becomes very cold.
New diseases can also occur, and farmers may lose all of their plants to such diseases.
Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050.
There are strong feelings against them because they are unnatural.
They may feed people, and then hurt them or their children later.
But both rich and poor countries are very interested in their use, and they are not going to go away.
In 2050 we may think differently about them.
