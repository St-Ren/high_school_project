Unit 11  The Best Medicine.
The human body has an amazing ability to heal itself.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the human body can naturally fight off 85 percent of all illnesses.
Many doctors would add that a persons emotions and mental attitude may either support or weaken the bodys healing ability.
Studies focusing on the link between emotions and the bodys immune system indicate that negative attitudes, thoughts, and emotions may lower the bodys immune responses.
On the other hand, positive ones like love, joy, and laughter can support the bodys immune responses.
Doctors have found clear proof to back up the claim that in many ways laughter is the best medicine.
First of all, laughing relaxes muscles.
As one study showed, people were able to relax their muscles more quickly after they had watched funny cartoons than after they had looked at beautiful pictures of nature.
And you dont need complicated equipment to test this effect.
Next time your friends laugh, ask them how they feel afterward.
Generally, people will respond that they feel more relaxed than they usually do.
Laughter also provides excellent exercise for your heart.
After a good laugh, a persons heart rate is well above normal, and this may last for up to five minutes.
Thus, some doctors refer to laughter as internal jogging.
In addition, laughter can stimulate the bodys production of immunoglobulin A (IgA).
IgA is what the body uses to fight colds and the flu.
Several studies have found that after people watch 30 minutes of comedies, the level of IgA in their blood has increased.
What is more, these studies included both adults and children.
Although no studies have been able to show a clear link between laughter and pain reduction, many patients have reported a decrease in pain after a good laugh.
This reduction in pain may result from chemicals produced in the blood.
Also, patients might feel less pain because their muscles are more relaxed, or because they are simply distracted from thinking about their pain.
It doesnt matter what the truth may be, since there are plenty of people who would agree with the comedian Groucho Marx, who once said, A clown is like aspirin, only he works twice as fast.
