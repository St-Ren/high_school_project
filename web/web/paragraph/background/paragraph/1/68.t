Like many other universities, Monsters University has everything you need in an American university.
It holds its teachers and students to high standards that require all of them to work hard.
But this is not an ordinary university.
It is a university that trains its students to become professional "scarers," whose goals are set upon getting energy from human screams.
Monsters University is a 2013 3-D animated comedy produced by Pixar Animation Studios, an American computer animation film studio based in Emeryville, California.
The success of the 2001 hit, Monsters, Inc.6, motivated the Studio to film this 2013 prequel.
Monsters University tells the story of how its heroes, Mike and Sulley, meet in university and later become workers of Monsters, Inc., a successful power company in the monster world, whose workers generate their city's power by scaring human children.
Inspired by his childhood tour to the Monsters, Inc., Mike plans to become a professional scarer.
He is admitted to the university and begins his new adventure.
 Mike studies hard while his roommate, a talented monster Sulley, tends to rely on his natural ability.
In the middle of the school year, both of them do poorly in studies and school activities.
They fail the test for SCARE 1018, and they will drop out of school when the school year ends.
To prove himself, Mike enters the school's Scare Games and teams up with Sulley, a lazy student and a cheater.
Though the team fails the first challenge, they finally win the final test.
Later, Mike discovers that Sulley cheats in the game.
To prove his ability of being a powerful scarer, Mike breaks into a school lab and enters a door that leads him to the human world.
His human adventure in a summer camp turns out to be a disaster because he fails to scare the human children.
Later he is joined by Sulley in the human world.
However, they are trapped by Dean Hardscrabble, who closes the door to the human world.
When they realize that the only way to get back into the monster world is to generate enough scream energy, Mike and Sulley finally work together to scare the adults.
They generate a huge amount of scream energy and get back to their own world.
This is a story of friendship and teamwork.
Mike says in the movie, "You and I are a team.
Nothing is more important than our friendship."
Though they complain about each other, they both always believe that they are the best team.
"I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you," says Mike.
This is also a story about two different kinds of people, a hard-working one and a talented one.
Who will win in the end?
Not a smart student, Mike has to work hard and fumble along the way; yet, without Mike's help, the talented Sulley will never get to his aim.
As a team, two of them can generate great power and energy, which would open any door to any place they want to be.
Using state-of-the-art technology, Pixar not only creates a fantasy 3-D movie for kids; it also uses its funny monsters to teach its young audience a great lesson.
