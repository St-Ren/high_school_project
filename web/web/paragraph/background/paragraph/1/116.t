As you drive or walk along the streets in almost any city, you cant help but notice that there are signs everywhere: store signs, street signs, and traffic signs.
Walk into a store or office, and youll see more signs.
While many of these signs use words as well as images to communicate, there are also many that rely entirely on symbols.
Think, for example, of this sign: (No U-turn).
Or this one: (No Smoking).
No language is necessary to know what these symbols mean.
Anyone from any country, speaking any language, can understand them.
That is why they are called international signs.
International signs have become increasingly important around the world as more and more people are traveling from country to country.
You will find them very often at places like airports, train stations, and bus stations.
While many of these signs, like the ones mentioned above, can be understood quickly and easily, others may be new to you.
A sign like this, for example, tells you where you can find a cart for your luggage, while tells you where there are lockers available for you to store your belongings in.
If youre hungry, you probably wont need anyone to tell you what this means: (restaurant).
You will also come across many international signs on highways and important roads.
Its easy to find a gas station, a motel, or even a phone, for example, if you just watch for the, and signs.
Even more important than these are signs that indicate traffic regulations or warn against dangerous driving situations.
, for instance, means that the driver will soon enter a divided highway, while means that the road is about to become narrower.
The driver who sees knows that rocks may fall from the side of a hill into the road.
There are even signs in some areas that will warn you of deer or cows  wandering onto the road.
International signs are certainly a great help to travelers.
Unfortunately, there are many situations in which symbols cannot replace the need for language.
Some very important signs still include words-for example, signs that say Entrance or Exit or Danger! Therefore, in order to understand signs, we need to know the words as well as the symbols.
