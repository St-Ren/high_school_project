Everyone is a poet, especially when he or she is in love.
In lovers' eyes, everything about their beloved ones is the fairest and most wonderful in the world.
To praise the beauty of their love, lovers often come up with numerous poetic expressions.
For example, they may compare their lovers' eyes to the shining stars and their smiles to the winter sunshine.
This kind of comparison, or figure of speech, is often used by poets in their works.
By comparing one thing to another, poets make what they want to describe more vivid and concrete to readers.
There are two major types of this kind of expression: similes and metaphors.
Simile is from the Latin word simili, which means likeness or similarity.
It is a comparison of two different things using the words "like" or "as."
When people say, "My love is like a red, red rose," or "Your eyes are as blue as the sky," they are making use of similes.
As for the metaphor, it is a direct comparison between two different things that does not use "like" or "as."
You may have heard someone say, "You are my sunshine" or "Life is a journey"; both of these are well-known examples of metaphors.
Now you are going to read two love poems that are written with similes and metaphors.
Read them slowly and see how the poets use these poetic devices.
My Love Is like an Ocean
My love is like an ocean
It goes down so deep
My love is like a rose
Whose beauty you want to keep.
My love is like a river
That will never end
My love is like a dove
With a beautiful message to send.
My love is like a song
That goes on and on forever
My love is like a prisoner
It's to you that I surrender.

If You Were a Shining Star
If you were a shining star
And I were your midnight,
I'd let you shine above me,
You'd be my only light.
If you were a scoop of ice cream
And I were an ice cream cone,
I'd put you on my shoulders
And hold you for my own.
If you were a grand piano
And I were a sweet love song,
I'd let your keys tickle and tease
My melody all day long.
If you were the pages of my book
And I were reading you,
I'd read as slow as I could go
So I never would get through.
