A Name Is Not Just a Name.
Jiayi, a high school student in Taiwan, has a new e-pal, Elizabeth, an American high school girl.
In her last e-mail to Jiayi, Elizabeth asked about the meaning of Jiayis name in Chinese.
In the following e-mails, they share stories about their names.
Dear Elizabeth,
Thanks for the reply.
Id be pleased to tell you about my Chinese name.
My full name is Tao Jiayi.
Tao is my family name and Jiayi is my given name.
Tao means a potter, a person who makes clay pots by hand.
Our ancestors  might have been potters thousands of years ago.
My given name, Jiayi, is from a fortune teller.
Most parents in Taiwan go to fortune tellers for a babys name.
We Chinese believe that a persons name should match his or her time of birth, or he/she may have an unlucky life.
My name is made up of two characters, Jia and Yi.
Jia means beautiful and Yi happy. According to the fortune teller, this name is perfect for my time of birth.
But in fact, Jiayi is a very common name.
There are twenty other students named Jiayi in my school.
How about your name?
What does it mean?
Dear Jiayi,
It was so great to get your reply.
Thank you for telling me such an interesting story about your name.
Naming is also a big event here but we dont go to fortune tellers; parents do the job of naming instead.
My mom and dad had an equal share in naming me Elizabeth Casas Smith.
My first name, Elizabeth, came from my great grandmother on my fathers side, in memory of her.
Its a biblical name which means Gods promise. Many English names have meanings that come from the Bible, like David and Sarah.
My family usually call me Liz, which is short for Elizabeth.
My middle name, Casas, is my mothers maiden name.
My mothers family came from Spain and Casas means house in Spanish.
My family name, Smith, is one of the most common English family names.
It refers to a blacksmith.
So one of my ancestors probably worked as a blacksmith a long time ago.
My parents always joke that my name means God promises me a house made by a blacksmith. I dont think I want to live in a house made of iron, though.
BTW, Id like to have a Chinese name.
Do you have any ideas?
