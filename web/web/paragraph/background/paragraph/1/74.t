Jenny decided to dump Henry, but instead of saying I want to break up with you, she said Youre a good guy.
As Professor Brown went into the classroom, he said Its pretty hot here, and two students turned on the air conditioner.
You may have found that sometimes our words do not literally mean what we want to say in our hearts.
But why cant we just say what we mean?
Why is so much communication not direct?
Why do we have to pick up the actual meanings of words in the voice and on the face?
First, it is important to get along and have good relationshipswto make people happy.
It is far better to get what we want and to be understood, without saying what we really mean.
It makes us feel the fine pleasure of being on the same wavelength.
This is the pleasure of those special conversations when we say just a few wordswor no words at allwand feel understood.
It is the communication prize and the reason we play the birthday-present and do-you-love-me games.
People can protect themselves by using indirectness.
Second, there is a benefit in self-defense.
If what we want or think does not meet with a positive response, we can take it back, or say that is not what we meant.
Through indirectness, we give others an idea of what we have in mind so that we can see what they might think before we give too much awaywa natural way of balancing our needs with the needs of others.
It is better to give a hint to our listeners about what we want to say.
By doing this, we can get a sense of others ideas and how others might react to our ideas.
The beauty and dangers of language are two sides of the same coin: the more indirect we are, the more room is left for listeners to interpret.
A word spoken or a small gesture can mean much more than its literal sense.
But subtle signals can be missed, and meaning can be taken that was not intended and that may or may not be a good thing.
Our power to communicate so much by so few words can inevitably cause communication problems.
If others respond oddly to things we say, we may try to state our intentions more directly.
When we find others indirect, we can ask the speaker to explain what he or she means.
However, we must realize that some people will feel challenged if their meaning is questioned, and then talk in a way that will make some people uncomfortable.
Therefore, the most important thing is to bear in mind that misunderstandings are natural and normal; they are not signs that there is something wrong with someone, or with the relationship.
