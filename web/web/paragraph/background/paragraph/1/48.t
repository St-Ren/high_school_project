Bird-Watching in Taiwan.
It is a cloudy day in October.
Over the Tseng-wen estuary in Taiwan, a group of large white birds with black faces appears.
These beautiful black-faced spoonbills are some of the worlds rarest birds.
There are only about six hundred of them in the world.
The birds have flown all the way from their summer home in Korea.
Now, they circle and land.
Almost immediately, a crowd of people begin to shoot them.
Is this the end for the spoonbills?
No, the people who have been waiting are happy to see the spoonbills.
They are only shooting photographs.
These people are some of Taiwans enthusiastic bird-watchers, or, as they are usually called, birders.
Birders look at birds from a distance, usually through binoculars.
This hobby began in Europe in the 1800s and spread around the world.
Although it did not come to Taiwan until the 1960s, it has become very popular here, especially among young people.
Groups of young birders compete to spot the most species.
Why do so many people enjoy birding?
It gets them out of the cities and into nature, they explain.
I never knew how beautiful Taiwan was until I started birding, says one young bird-watcher.
In addition to local birders, there are also many bird-watching tourists from North America, Europe, and Japan.
Taiwan is a paradise for birders.
This small island has many different climate zones, from tropical on the coast to cold in the mountains.
Each of these areas attracts different speciesXabout 440 species altogether.
For comparison, in the United States, which is over 250 times larger than Taiwan, there are only 800 bird species.
In fact, Taiwan has more bird species per square kilometer than almost any other place in the world.
Only Madagascar has a greater number of species per square kilometer than Taiwan.
The Wild Bird Society of Taiwan says that 40 percent of Taiwans birds are residents.
Resident birds live in Taiwan all the time.
Most of them live in the mountains in the middle of the island.
Of these, 15 species are found in no other country but Taiwan.
Another 40 percent are migrants.
In other words, they dont live in Taiwan all the time.
Many birds fly south from Siberia, Korea, and Japan in the fall.
Some continue south to Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand.
Others stay in Taiwan for the winter.
In the spring, Taiwan is visited by birds from the south.
The remaining 20 percent of Taiwans birds are, well, lost.
They usually stop on the island because of bad weather.
These birds are called vagrants.
Taiwans birders love to watch birds, but they also try to protect them.
They have had some success.
In 1981, the Taiwanese government created special areas for birds.
Birders also try to stop industrial development in places where rare birds live.
They are fighting against a plan to build an oil refinery and steel mill near the spoonbills nesting ground.
The plan has been delayed for now, and the population of spoonbills has almost doubled.
Today the birds, tomorrow the humans, birders often say.
In other words, the same ecological problems that kill birds now may someday endanger the health of people.
In Taiwan, birders are working to save birds for future generations to enjoy.
And thanks to the birders, the black-faced spoonbills still have a home to come to from their long trip across the sea.
