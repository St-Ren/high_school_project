Four-year-old Jane Goodall was puzzled by the question of how hens laid eggs.
So she set out to find an answer to this mystery.
She hid in a henhouse, waiting to see how a hen laid an egg.
Finally, four hours later, she had her answer.
Excited, she ran off to tell her mother.
For Goodall, this event began a lifetime of discovery.
Goodall was born in England in 1.
She grew up reading Tarzan books and spent as much time outdoors as she could.
When she was nine, she dreamed of going to Africa.
She never attended university.
Instead, she worked as a waitress for several years, saving money for her trip to Africa.
Then at age twenty-three, she finally boarded a ship in England and made her way to Kenya, where Goodall met the famous anthropologist Louis Leakey.
She worked as his secretary for a while.
Then one day, Leakey told Goodall he wanted to send her to the African rain forest to study chimpanzees.
She would have to stay awhile.
He told her that the research project might take as long as ten years.
Goodall was excited by the opportunity, but officials worried about her safety in the African rain forest.
At that time, chimpanzees were thought to be violent animals.
Many people said Goodall wouldn't last three weeks in the rain forest.
They seriously underestimated her.
Goodall's study of the chimpanzees has lasted for more than forty years.
Those forty years have been full of wonderful and surprising discoveries.
The more Goodall watched the chimpanzees, the more she noticed how similar they are to humans.
Chimpanzees, for example, show affection in much the same way humans do.
They kiss, hug, hold hands, and even tickle one another.
Goodall helped us realize that animals can experience emotions.
They know both joy and sadness.
Amazingly, Goodall discovered that chimpanzees make and use tools.
Before this discovery, scientists thought that humans were the only tool makers on earth.
Goodall's discoveries have forced us to look at chimps in a completely new way.
We have realized just how much we have in common with other living things.
Goodall, who watched hens lay eggs as a little girl, has in fact taught the world another important lesson.
She has shown us that a little curiosity and a bold, adventurous spirit can lead to amazing discoveries.
