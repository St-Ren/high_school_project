Today, about 4 billion people are using English for their everyday life and work.
Of this 4 billion, about 40 % are native English speakers and 60% are non-native speakers.
As English becomes an important second language throughout the world, it is changing into a simpler version of itself.
During the last century, American English was getting more popular than the Queen's English.
Now, the English language is transforming into a new global language.
People call it global English or Globish-a tool of communication.
Globish aims to help people from different countries to communicate easily.
As a result, there are a number of things that make Globish different from the "standard" English.
First of all, Globish vocabulary starts with a limited number of English words-just 1,500 easy words.
Also, Globish takes all different English spellings.
For example, people can use both theatre and theater.
Most importantly, when people use Globish, clear communication is their biggest concern.
Every speaker should help the listener understand his or her message.
Therefore, a Globish speaker will try to use shorter sentences and keep grammar simple.
In addition, Globish speakers may repeat the same sentences twice or add body language to help the listener understand.
They would not use such questions as "You don't like cats?"
in their talk because the listener may not know how to answer the question.
To help the listener understand, Globish speakers will ask "Do you like cats?"
with gesture.
Then, the listener will answer the question with a full sentence like "Yes, I like cats."
Or "No, I don't like cats."
in Globish.
A lot of people find Globish easier than the "standard" English.
This is true.
However, some people think Globish can be too simple and direct.
Speakers may become impolite or even rude when they use too much short and direct language.
For some people, the study of the English language and its culture is still useful and can be fun.
Yet, Globish is not an official language but a linguistic tool for people to use in this globalized world.
It is one of the modern choices for busy working people around the world.
