We have always found our "secret" night-time journeys fascinating.
However, do you know that by the time you are sixty you will have slept 175,200 hours, dreamed 87,000 hours and had 197,100 dreams?
Probably not.
Also, many of us probably don't remember what we dreamed during our childhood sleeping hours, and don't know what they meant.
Some say: Our dreams tell us about our present state of consciousness; this is why we dream.
We dream during the REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep.
We have about five periods of REM sleep during the night.
The first REM cycle lasts about ten minutes.
As the night goes on, REM cycles get longer.
By early morning, REM cycles can last for up to ninety minutes.
Usually in this last REM cycle, we remember our dreams.
Dreams change as people age.
Infants dream about half of the time they are asleep.
But, of course, we do not know what they dream about.
At age eight or nine, children start to tell their dreams as stories.
People aged twenty-one to thirty-four report that many of their dreams are about feeling guilty for things that they did.
Older people usually dream about work or their families.
Many dreams show common ideas and concerns.
People often dream about falling, flying, or floating in the sky.
In many dreams, people forget something important, such as going to work on time or putting on clothes.
In addition, people miss their bus, plane, or train, or they are late for an appointment in their dreams.
Furthermore, most people's dreams have two other people in them.
Bad dreams are more common than good ones.
When people are in trouble, they often have negative dreams.
People who had experienced accidents when they were young dream about death more often than those people who had not.
Moreover, more women than men talk about their dreams.
Do you want to remember your dreams?
If you do, you can train yourself to remember your dreams.
One way is to tell yourself or record your dream when you wake up.
Keep a pen and paper or a tape/MP recorder near your bed to do so.
We never stop dreaming.
But we cannot really say what dreams mean or how they happen.
Dreams are still a mystery.
