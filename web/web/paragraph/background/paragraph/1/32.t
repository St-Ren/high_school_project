Chien-ming Wang: The Prince of Baseball.
After Chien-ming Wang had pitched for eight innings, Yankees pitching coach Ron Guidry came to talk to him.
Wang was told that he had only one more inning to prove his worth.
Under great pressure, Wang gave it his best shot on the mound.
That night, he tossed a two-hit shutout to beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 6-0.
It seems that extra stress always fuels him.
In 2006, at the age of twenty-six, he was one of the best young pitchers in Major League Baseball.
Back in 2000, Atlanta offered Wang more money than the Yankees.
Instead of signing with Atlanta, however, Wang chose to sign with the Yankees.
His reason was simple.
He just wanted to be close to his childhood idol, Roger Clemens, a Yankees pitcher.
Another episode also reveals Wangs simple personality.
Once John Cox, the scout for the Yankees, paid Wang a visit, and asked what he could do for Wang.
To Johns surprise, Wang only asked for a rice cooker.
Wang is a man of few words.
Mike Mussina, another superb Yankees pitcher, once said, Ive never seen him get excited or upset about anything.
But being a pitcher, thats a good way to be. Though he is quiet, he never loses a chance to make people around him laugh.
Sometimes he parrots the slang words he has learned from his teammates and uses them on his coaches or friends.
Most of the time, he has good  comic timing.
His humor therefore has won him many friends on foreign soil.
With more and more calluses on his fingers, he seems to be pitching better and better.
Now he is a national hero in Taiwan.
Whenever he shows up, fans stop him and ask for an autograph.
This big boy from Tainan has finally found his place on the mound.
