What is a friend?
A friend is many things: someone who can share our joys and our sorrows, someone who will laugh at our jokes and wipe away our tears, someone who will help us to find success and to overcome failure.
A friend will walk by our side when we are lonely, and will step aside when we need room to grow.
A friend is someone we can depend upon in good times and bad times.
It is someone who is always there, even when we are miles away.
A friend is someone who will always tell us the truth, and who wants to hear the truth from us.
It is someone with whom we can always be ourselves.
The following poems offer some more ideas about friends.
Reading them, you will probably find yourself thinking about the special friends in your own life.
New Friends and Old Friends
by Joseph Parry
Make new friends, but keep the old;
Those are silver, these are gold.
New-made friendships, like new wine,
Age will mellow and refine.
Friendships that have stood the testX
Time and changeXare surely best;
Brow may wrinkle, hair grow gray;
Friendship never knows decay.
For mid old friends, tried and true,
Once more we our youth renew.
But old friends, alas!
New friends must their place supply.
Cherish friendship in your breastX
New is good, but Old is best;
Make new friends, but keep the old;
Those are silver, these are gold.
By Jan Anderson
The friends of our childhood, the friends of our past
We think of them fondly from first to last:
As children they were our playmates;
As students they were our classmates.
But through the years some are forgotten and move away
As each has gone his own separate way.
But others become our friends for life
They always share our triumphs and strife.
They urge us on when we want to quit;
They are the ones well never forget.
Even when we get older, independent and bolder,
Sometimes our life becomes lonely and colder,
And we need to cry on a true friends shoulder
Friends give us comfort when we are sad,
Correct us with love when we are bad,
Calm us down when we are mad,
And give us new hope to make us glad.
At every stage of life we always need friends,
For on them much joy in our life depends.
