Dont Be Fooled Again.
There is no easy way of telling when someone is lying, but there are various signs to look for.
For example, liars often touch their faces.
A liar may stroke his chin or touch his nose.
In fact, the fairy tale Pinocchio is closer to reality than one might think.
According to the Chicago Smell and Taste Foundation, peoples noses get bigger when they lie because blood goes to the nose.
As a result, people often scratch their noses when they are lying.
Researchers found this out when they watched a tape of a person talking.
When the person was telling the truth, he didnt touch his nose.
When he was lying, he touched it once every four minutes.
You should also watch a persons eye movements.
Most people think that we keep eye contact when we tell the truth and look away when we lie.
However, this is not true.
Many people look right at you because they want to appear sincere.
In fact, there is an unconscious reason why people may not look at you when they are telling the truth.
When people have to recall information from memory, their eyes move up.
They do this unconsciously again and again.
In addition to body language and eye contact, you can also pay attention to change of voice.
A variation in the pitch of a voice or the rate of speech can be a sign of lying.
So can lots of umms and ahhs. For instance, if the speakers pitch turns high, then it is very possible that the speaker is lying.
Complex lies result in a slower speech rate, while simple ones produce the opposite result.
The point here is that no particular behavior means a person is lying.
The secret is to watch people closely and follow their mental processes.
As you watch their body language, eye movements, and any changes in voice, look for the patterns.
The more you practice detecting lies, the better youll get at it.
