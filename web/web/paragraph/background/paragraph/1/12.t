Idioms are phrases whose meanings are different from the literal meanings of the words they contain.
The meaning of an idiom is often not obvious or clear.
You may find it difficult to understand the expression even if you think you know every word in it.
There are all kinds of idioms that are used to express a number of different and special meanings.
One very common theme of English idioms is body parts.
If you listen or read carefully, you will probably find that many idioms contain body parts.
Body parts are often used in idioms probably because they are so close to us.
Imagine the following situation: your American friend Matt told you that he had his heart set on buying the latest cell phone.
However, he knew that it would cost an arm and a leg, so he had to get a part-time job and work his fingers to the bone on evenings and weekends in order to pay for it.
Matt also told you about his part-time job at a convenience store.
One day, a suspicious-looking customer came into the store.
Matt suspected that the guy had sticky fingers.
He watched him carefully and caught him red-handed trying to slip a packet of gum into his pocket.
You might have a difficult time understanding what Matt was talking about.
However, from the context of what he said and the way in which he used the words, you could figure out that Matt wanted very much to buy a really expensive cell phone, and that he had to work very hard to make enough money to buy it.
In the store, Matt saw a shoplifter who was trying to steal some gum, and he caught him on the spot.
Idioms may be difficult to understand, and may take a lot of time to learn.
However, they make our language much more interesting and colorful.
Learn more about them, and you will find that using and understanding them can be a lot of fun!
