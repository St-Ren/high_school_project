Science plays a big role in everything we do in the kitchen.
It is the magic that turns a pile of ingredients like flour, sugar and eggs into something new, like a chocolate cake.
Have you ever boiled eggs, and found them split open in the water?
Next time try remembering this physics lesson: heated air expands!
But how will this lesson help you boil an egg?
The fat end of an egg has a small air bubble.
When this air is heated by the boiling water, it expands and causes the egg shell to crack.
Use a pin to make a small hole into the bottom of the egg before you boil it.
This will give the expanding air a way to escape, without cracking the shell.
Do you know the chemistry behind a good steak?
The heat from the pan causes a reaction in the meat.
This happens when protein and sugars in the meat join together to form a new molecule.
Its this new molecule that slowly changes the color of the meat from red to pink and gives the steak its flavor.
Remember the pan must be hot enough for this reaction to occur; otherwise , youll have a gray and flavorless steak.
Have you ever sliced an onion?
Did it make you cry?
When you cut up an onion you are allowing a reaction to occur.
Onions contain sulphur compounds.
When you cut the onion, these compounds are released into the air and irritate your eyes.
The next time you need to chop an onion, remember this short science lesson: reactions happen slower at lower temperatures.
Put the onion in the refrigerator first; it will then release fewer irritating compounds when you cut it.
So you see, all of that science you learn in school can be put to good use!
Often, you need only to look closely at something to see the science that makes it work.
As in the case of the onion, you just might be able to keep yourself from shedding too many tears!
