For 9% of the people in the world, it is natural to live their lives mainly using the right hand.
They use their right hand to write and draw.
They use it to hold chopsticks and forks, toothbrushes, and remote controls.
They also use it to play basketball and Wii.
There are, however, people who prefer to reach out to the world with their left hand.
These left-handed people face a lot of difficulties.
They have a hard time writing from left to right.
They also look awkward when they use scissors.
That's why left-handedness was once thought of as being abnormal and sometimes even a disease.
But, in fact, left-handed people are normal and healthy.
They can also be very outstanding.
For example, da Vinci and Napoleon were both left-handers, and so is the popular singer Wang Leehom.
As for the causes of left-handedness, some scientists think it comes from one's parents.
Others say it comes from hormones.
Actually, the main causes are still unknown.
Fortunately, people are now more aware of their left-handed friends out there.
There are tools made for the safety and convenience of left-handed people.
The designs of doors, desks, and computer mouses are more friendly to them.
Special shops and websites can also be found for left-handers.
In England, there is even a piano for the left-handed.
The keyboard and pedals are reversed!
There is one way the public can show thoughtfulness to lefthanders, which is to say "Happy Left-Handers' Day!"
every August 1. Who knows?
It's possible that people might even meet their Mr. or Ms. "Right" while they are celebrating the uniqueness of a left-handed friend on this special day.
But a person should be careful when he or she greets a left-handed friend with a friendly hug or a polite kiss on the cheek.
Their heads might bump into each other!
