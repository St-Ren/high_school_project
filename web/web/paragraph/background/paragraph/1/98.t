Unit 11  The Alternative Nobel Prize.
Having a meal is an easy and delightful process for most people.
However, for a woodpecker, its not that simple.
What does a woodpecker do to get its dinner?
Well, what it has to do is hit its head against a tree dozens of times.
Yet, amazingly, it never suffers any ill effects like brain damage, even though it has to peck numerous times per day.
According to research, it is the woodpeckers thick head bones that protect it from the impact of the blows.
For explaining that, Ivan Schwab won an Ig Nobel Prize for Ornithology.
The Ig Nobel Prizes are organized by The Annals of Improbable Research, an American magazine that celebrates the funny side of science.
Each year, ten winners are awarded prizes in honor of their achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think. Most of the award-winning research, like Schwabs, may seem unusual, but it usually grabs peoples attention indeed.
And no matter how ridiculous the research sounds, people can find it inspiring and amusing.
With these awards in mind, you might be more interested in Brian Wansinks research.
He took home an Ig Nobel Prize for Nutrition for looking into the influence of visual factors on peoples appetites.
He used specially designed bowls that refilled themselves with soup while people were eating.
Since these people had no idea this was happening, they just kept eating from these bottomless bowls. They said they didnt feel full because their bowls were not empty yet.
The results of this research showed that people in this experiment ate 73 percent more soup than normal.
Owing to these results, Wansink concluded that its not peoples stomachs that decide when they have eaten enough, but their eyes.
In addition to facts and discoveries that people have never heard of, the Ig Nobel Prizes also give attention to science and technology that is a part of our daily lives.
Take the karaoke machine, for example.
It was born in 1971, and its inventor Daisuke Inoue was given an Ig Nobel Peace Prize for creating it.
Inoue was employed at a nightclub, playing the piano for the customers who wanted to sing.
Since he wasnt skillful enough to play all the songs properly, he tried to think of some ways to clear up the problem.
Thus, he created the karaoke machine.
To Inoues surprise, the machine caused considerable changes in entertainment worldwide.
The Ig Nobel Prize was awarded to Inoue not only because his invention was entertaining, but also because it has brought about an entirely new way for people to learn to tolerate each other.
These research results of Ig Nobel Prizes may not be as great as Edisons light bulb or Newtons laws of motion.
Nevertheless, they do show peoples willingness to take action and to try new ways to solve problems.
It is not about how much a person accomplishes, but about how desperately he or she has tried to achieve something.
According to Marc Abrahams, a founder of the Ig Nobel Prizes, if you win one, it signifies that you have done something.
