Well, it's Mother's Day!
Mother's Day seems to be a time when families spend money and have fun nowadays, but this holiday had a very serious meaning in the beginning.
It all began with Julia Ward Howe, a songwriter who was horrified at the death and destruction of the American Civil War.
She called on all mothers to protest the killing of their sons.
In 1, Howe proposed an international mother's day to promote peace.
Years later, a woman named Anna Jarvis also called for an official mother's day.
At her church in West Virginia, Jarvis handed out carnations in remembrance of her mother and in honor of peace.
Finally, in 1, President Woodrow Wilson declared that the second Sunday of May would be Mother's Day, a day to remember the great contributions made by mothers to their families and to society.
From then on, people began honoring their mothers by sending cards, flowers, or anything that would please their moms.
However, the increasing number of people spending money on gifts greatly upset Anna Jarvis.
She hated to see businessmen taking advantage of this holiday to sell gifts and services.
Therefore, Jarvis did many things to stop commercial activities held on Mother's Day.
For example, she protested the sale of flowers.
She interrupted a meeting of the American War Mothers and got arrested.
And she was not happy with the postage stamp featuring her mother, a vase of white carnations, and the words "Mother's Day."
All such activities seemed to Anna Jarvis only a misuse of this holiday.
Despite the commercialization of the holiday, there are some Mother's Day customs that are worth mentioning.
In Mexico, a mother is usually treated to a song sung by her family or a hired band.
A family breakfast is also customary.
In Finland, a mother is served with breakfast in bed and presented with a bunch of flowers freshly picked in the wild by her family.
In Sweden, the Red Cross sells small plastic flowers and donates all the money to poor mothers and their children.
Most of the activities mentioned above don't cost a lot, but the love thus shown is the same.
So, what are you going to do to show your love for your mom this year?
