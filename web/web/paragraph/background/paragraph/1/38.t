Bob, a well-dressed man
Young Bob, Bob, twenty years younger
Young Jimmy, Young Bobs best friend
Narrator: A New York City policeman on his beat walks up an empty street.
It is almost ten oclock at night.
The wind is chilly and it looks like it will rain very soon.
The policeman finds Bob standing in the shadows.
Bob: Its all right, officer.
Im just waiting for a friend.
Policeman: Yes?
Bob: Its an appointment made twenty years ago.
Can you see the store there?
Twenty years ago it was a restaurant ---- Big Joe Bradys.
Policeman: That was torn down five years ago.
Narrator: Bob strikes a match and lights his cigar.
The light shows a little white scar near his right eyebrow.
He wears a large diamond pin on his scarf.
Bob: Twenty years ago tonight I had dinner in the restaurant with Jimmy Wells, my best chum and the finest chap in the world.
He and I grew up right here in New York, just like two brothers.
I still remember that dayK
Narrator: Twenty years ago, young Bob and Jimmy are talking at Big Joe Bradys restaurant.
Young Bob: Are you sure you dont want to go west with me, Jimmy?
Im telling you, we can make our fortunes out there.
Young Jimmy: I guess Ill stay right here in New York, Bob.
To me, this is the only place on earth.
Young Bob: Ill miss you, pal.
Young Jimmy: And Ill miss you.
Young Bob: Say, why dont we make an appointment to meet each other again?
Young Jimmy: What do you mean?
Young Bob: Lets meet up again, years from now, when well have our destinies worked out and our fortunes made.
What do you say we meet again in twenty years?
Young Jimmy: No matter who we are, or what were doing, or how far we have to come, twenty years from tonight lets meet right here, at Big Joe Bradys.
Young Bob: Its a deal.
Ill see you then, pal!
Scene Three
Policeman: Thats very interesting.
But havent you heard from your friend at all since you last saw him?
Bob: Well, yes.
For a time we wrote letters.
But after a year or two we lost track of each other.
But I know Jimmy will meet me here if hes still alive.
Hell never forget.
I came a thousand miles to be here, but it will be worth it if my old pal turns up!
Narrator: Bob takes a diamond-studded watch from his pocket.
Bob: Its three minutes to ten.
It was exactly ten oclock when we parted here.
Policeman: Did pretty well in the West, didnt you?
Bob: You bet!
I hope Jimmy has done half as well.
He is too honest to make a fortune.
Policeman: I have to go.
Hope your friend comes around all right.
Are you going to wait until ten oclock?
Ill wait for him at least until ten-thirty ---- maybe longer!
Goodbye, officer!
Policeman: Good night, sir.
Scene Four
Narrator: It begins to rain.
Bob waits, smoking his cigar.
After twenty minutes, a tall man in a light overcoat crosses the street.
Man: Is that you, Bob?
Bob: Is that you, Jimmy Wells?
Man: Bless my heart!
Its Bob, sure as fate.
I was certain Id find you here if you were still alive.
Well, well, well!
The restaurants gone, or we could have another dinner here.
How was the West, old man?
Bob: It has given me all I wanted.
Youve changed a lot, Jimmy.
I never thought you were so tall.
Man: Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty.
Bob: Are you doing well here in New York, Jimmy?
Man: Not bad.
I work for the city.
Come on, Bob, lets find a place to talk about old times.
Narrator: The two men walk up the street, arm in arm.
Bob tells his friend all about his career.
The other man listens with interest.
Soon they pass a brightly-lit store.
Under the lights, the two men take a good look at each other.
Bob: Hold on!
Youre not Jimmy Wells!
Twenty years is a long time, but its not long enough to turn a mans eyes from brown to blue!
Man: It can be long enough to turn a good man into a bad one.
Youve been under arrest for the past ten minutes, Silky Bob.
The Chicago police department thought you might come to New York.
They have some questions to ask you.
Bob (sighs): Ill come quietly.
But how did you know where to find me?
Man: Heres a note for you.
You can read it before I take you to the police station.
Its from Patrolman Wells.
Narrator: Bob reads the note.
Policeman: Dear Bob, I was at the appointed place on time.
When you struck the match to light your cigar, I recognized your face from a wanted poster sent from Chicago.
Somehow I couldnt arrest you myself, so I went around and got a  plainclothes detective to do the job.
Signed, your friend after twenty years, Jimmy.
