Unit 7  A Little Science Works a Lot of Magic.
Things often have more uses than you could ever imagine.
Some common items that we use every day can seem to perform magic when you know how to use them.
Take sugar cubes, for example.
You can add one to coffee or tea to make the drink sweet.
However, most people dont know that theres another thing that sugar cubes can doXkeep cookies crisp!
Just prepare two jars of cookies, and put several sugar cubes into one of the jars.
After two weeks, you will find that the cookies in the jar with the sugar cubes in it are crisper than those cookies in the other jar.
Its an easy way to keep cookies crisp, isnt it?
If your friends are surprised, tell them how it works.
The sugar cubes in the jar can absorb moisture.
Thats why you can keep cookies from turning soft.
Better yet, the same method can be used to store milk powder, melon seeds, peanuts, and so on.
If your friends are not impressed by the magic of sugar cubes, try the following trick: Use oil or citrus peel to get rid of the stains which are made by markers or correction fluid.
Have you ever stained your desk with markers or correction fluid by accident?
When you have difficulty removing the stains with tissues, rags, or even your bare hands, what else can you do?
Try using some oil or citrus peel!
Believe it or not, baby oil, medicated oil, or even oil from potato chips can help remove stubborn stains effectively.
Just follow these steps.
First, prepare some baby oil.
Then, put a few drops of the oil on the stain.
Two minutes later, gently wipe up the oil and the stain with some tissues.
Amazingly, the stained area will look clean again.
Citrus peel also works in this situation.
Just prepare some peel from a citrus fruit such as an orange, lemon, or lime.
Next, squeeze a few drops of juice from the peel on the stains.
Lastly, rub the stains with the citrus peel.
The stains will gradually come off, and finally they will be gone.
The secret behind the magic is that the organic substances from these kinds of oil and the acid content from a citrus peel can help break down the stains, and thus, make them easier to remove.
Although these tricks may seem like magic, they are really just examples of the use of science in our everyday lives.
Science can look like magic when you dont understand it.
However, when you do, you will realize that science is not just for the laboratory, but also for life.
