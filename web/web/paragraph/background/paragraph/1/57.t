Something Old, Something New.
Although weddings vary greatly in the United States, at most American weddings, the bride follows certain traditions of dress.
These traditions are often expressed in an old saying that tells women what they should wear or carry when they marry: Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue.
This good luck saying dates back to Victorian times in the 1800s, and many American brides today still try to dress according to this saying.
Something old symbolizes the connection with the brides family and the past.
Many brides wear a piece of family jewelry or a mothers or grandmothers wedding dress.
Something new symbolizes good luck and success in the brides new life.
The wedding dress is often the new item.
However, the bride may also wear new jewelry.
Something borrowed reminds the bride that friends and family will help her when she needs them to.
The borrowed object might be something such as a lace handkerchief, or a best friends bridal veil.
Something blue is a symbol of faithfulness and loyalty.
Often the blue item is the garter worn on the brides leg.
It might also be a ribbon or a piece of jewelry.
The bride carries flowers as a symbol of happiness.
At the end of the wedding reception, the bride tosses her bouquet to all the single women who are attending the party.
The single woman who catches the bouquet is believed to be the next who will marry.
Throwing the garter began in France, where pieces of the brides clothing were considered lucky.
The bride would throw her garter to the guests at the wedding and whoever caught it could expect good luck.
In the United States, the groom traditionally removes the garter from the brides leg and throws it to the unmarried men.
The man who catches it is thought to be the next who will marry.
At some weddings, the man who catches the garter will place it on the leg of the woman who caught the bouquet.
It is also common for the recipients of the bouquet and garter to have their photo taken with the bride and groom.
Whatever the bride wears, it is also traditional that she be the best-dressed woman at the wedding party.
So, it is considered very impolite for other women at the wedding to dress more beautifully than the bride.
