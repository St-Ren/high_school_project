Passing through an airport one morning, I caught one of those trains that take travelers from the main terminal to their boarding gates.
Free and clean, the trains run back and forth all day long.
Not many people consider them fun, but this Saturday I heard laughter.
At the front of the first car, a man and his son were looking out the window at the track.
The train had just stopped and let off passengers.
As the doors closed again, the father said excitedly, Here we go!
Hold on to me tight! The boy, about five years old, screeched in delight.
Look! the father said to his son.
See that pilot?
I bet hes walking to his plane. The son craned his neck to look.
As I got off, I remembered something I had wanted to buy before boarding the plane.
I was early for my flight, so I decided to go back to the terminal.
Later, just as I was about to re-board the train for my gate, I saw that the man and his son were back at the platform, too.
Do you want to go home now the father asked.
I want to ride some more!
More the father said.
Youre not tired?
This is fun! his son said.
All right, the father replied, and when a door opened, we all got on.
I then realized that they had not been heading for a flight at all, but had just been riding the shuttle for fun.
Where are all these people going, Daddy the son asked.
All over the world, the father replied.
The other people in the airport were leaving for places or arriving at the ends of their journeys.
The father and the son, though, were just riding this shuttle together, making it exciting, and sharing each others company.
There are parents who can afford to send their children to Europe or Disneyland, yet many of those children turn out rotten and cause social problems.
There are parents who live in poverty and cannot give their children cars or swimming pools, but their kids grow up to be happy and successful.
There are so many social problems.
There are so many debates over possible solutions.
Yet, the answer to these problems is simple: if parents care enough to spend time with and pay attention to their kids, these problems will not happen.
Here was a father who just cared about spending the day with his son and came up with this plan for a Saturday morning.
It costs nothing, yet it is the most priceless thing in the world.
The train picked up speed, and the father pointed at something, and the boy laughed again.
I smiled to myself and thought, The answer is so simple.
