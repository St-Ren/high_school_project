The Truth about Fitness Myths
Are you trying to lose some extra pounds so youll look good in your summer clothes?
In the summer, many people decide to get fit.
But while their motivation is good, their methods sometimes are not.
Over the years, statements like eat less to lose weight have been passed around as good advice.
But in fact, such fitness strategies are unhealthyXand even dangerous.
Unfortunately, many people want to lose weight so badly that they will believe any adviceXgood or bad.
Here are four of the most often-heard myths about getting fit.
If I just eat less, I will lose weight.
Many people only focus on the amount of food they consume each day.
They fail to pay attention to what theyre eating.
So they may be eating less, but theyre not eating healthily.
Be sure to eat a good balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats.
You need all three food groups to maintain a healthy body.
What you eat is important.
Running is all the exercise I need to lose weight.
You need aerobic exercise to burn off your extra fat.
But that alone doesnt help you get fit.
You must also lift weights to build muscle.
You need both to get the most effective workout.
If I build muscle, I will gain weight.
This statement is actually true.
Muscle is more dense than fat, so the same amount weighs more.
But muscle also takes up less space.
When you replace fat with muscle, you will be thinner and your clothes will feel looser.
The miracle diets advertised on TV will help me lose weight.
Just go channel surfing and you will see ads for the latest diet pill or exercise machine.
They promise a miracle solution to your weight problem.
But usually, the products dont live up to their promise and can even be dangerous.
Dont waste your money on them.
The best advice
As you can see from the above, not all fitness advice is good advice.
Be careful which advice you follow.
So, what is the best way to get fit?
Eat healthily and maintain a good balance of aerobic and muscle-building exercises.
Make your healthy lifestyle last for a lifetime, not just for the summer.
