Now don't get me wrong.
I am not so dumb.
I get around.
I have two older sisters.
So, I know what is going on.
It was funny how I met him.
It was a winter night like any other night.
I did not have my chemistry homework done.
I looked out the window and noticed the moonlight on the twigs and the snow blowing in the wind.
I just could not stay inside.
The skating rink is just a five-minute walk from my house if the sidewalks are not slippery, so I went skating.
I was out of breath when I got there.
I waited a moment to feel calm.
You know, to start to skate in a crowded rink is like jumping onto a moving merry-go-round.
Upon getting into the rink, however, I was fine.
At least, I found out exactly where the rough ice was.
It was "round, round, jump the rut, round, round, jump the rut, round, round."
And then, there he was!
All of a sudden his arm was around my waist so warm and tight.
And he said, "Mind if I skate with you?"
Then he took my other hand.
Just like that and we were skating.
It was not that I had never skated with a boy before.
Don't be silly.
I told you before.
I get around.
But this was different.
He was smooth!
He was a big shot at school and the best dancer in town.
This was different.
 Then we sat on the big snow bank by the rink and just watched.
It was cold at first, but pretty soon I got warm all over.
He threw some snow at me and it fell in a little white shower on my hair.
And he leaned over to brush it off.
I held my breath.
The night stood still.
Then he sat up straight and said, "We'd better start for home now."
He went to get my shoes.
He was still smiling when he came.
He took off my skates and tied the wet skate strings in a knot and put them over his shoulder.
Then he held out his hand and helped me up from the snow bank.
It was snowing harder now.
Big, quiet flakes clung to us lovingly.
It was all so lovely that I was sorry I lived only a few blocks away.
There was a very short and respectable kind of conversation and then we were home.
The porch light was on.
We stood there a moment by the front steps and the snow turned pinkish in the light and a few feathery flakes settled on my hair.
Then he took my skates and put them over my shoulder and stood very very close to my cheek and softly said, "Good night now.
I'll call you."
 "I'll call you."
That was what he said, "I'll call you."
I could not sleep all night.
That was last Thursday.
Tonight is Tuesday.
I cannot think of anything but snowflakes and ice skates and a yellow moon and Thursday night.
The telephone is sitting on the corner tablesilent.
My heart still prays but my mind just laughs.
Outside the night is still, so still I think I will go crazy.
However, I am not even sad because, all of a sudden, I know.
For suddenly I know; I know what the stars knew all the timehe will never, never callnever.
