Global warming is an issue that is being discussed everywhere.
We have learned to help solve the problem by saving energy and recycling resources.
However, we may not be aware that changing our diet can also help stop global warming.
For a start, we can simply choose to eat more vegetables and less meat.
According to a study of consumer behavior in the U.S., meat consumption is one of the major causes of damage to the environment.
For one thing, all farm animals, such as cows and pigs, release methane from their bodies.
One cow can produce up to 6 liters of methane each day, and methane is the second most common greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide.
Many environmental experts now believe that methane is even more responsible for global warming than carbon dioxide.
For another thing, meat production affects the environment through the use of water and land.
Look at the charts below.
The amount of water and land used to produce meat is many times as much as that used to grow crops.
Obviously, a vegetarian diet can benefit not only our health but also our environment.
In addition, food that travels a long distance to the market is not friendly to the environment.
Therefore, some people are now promoting the idea of eating local foods.
We may count how many calories our food contains, but we rarely count how many miles the food has traveled before it reaches our table.
For example, California grapes travel more than 1, kilometers to Taiwan, and Fuji apples over 2,.
This long-distance transportation by truck, ship, or plane means more consumption of oil.
Thus, if we eat more local foods, we can reduce the amount of greenhouse gas we produce.
Like eating local foods, eating seasonal foods is also a good way to lower the burden on our environment.
Fruits and vegetables that are not in season need more fertilizer to grow and more electricity to store.
Therefore, out-of-season foods are usually more expensive.
Smart consumers, especially housewives, should make better and wiser choices.
Our choice of food obviously has a serious influence on our whole planet, especially when its limited resources are nearly used up.
So for ourselves, and for a better environment for our future generations, let's start to change our eating habits.
