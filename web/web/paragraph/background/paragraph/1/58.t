Using Politically Correct English.
If you dont want to offend someone, you had better know which English words to use---and which to avoid.
Imagine that you are in a restaurant in America.
You want some water, so you call out, Waitress!  A waitress comes to your table, but she looks a little irritated.
What did you do wrong?
You may have offended her by calling her a waitress.  Today many people prefer the word server to waiter or waitress. Why?
As society changes, so does our language.
Today the word server is considered more politically correct (or PC) by many people.
Politically correct English is an attempt to make language more respectful to all people.
Words that put too much emphasis on gender are slowly being taken away from the English vocabulary.
They include words that end in ess or man.  For example, many women who serve passengers on airplanes now prefer to be called flight attendants, not stewardesses.  In the past, only women could be flight attendants.
But today, many men have entered the profession, too.
Flight attendant is a better word, because it includes both men and women.
And many women are entering jobs that were once only occupied by men.
So words like policeman are being replaced.
Now police officer is the preferred term.
The use of pronouns is another problem.
Unfortunately, English has no gender-neutral singular pronoun that can be used to replace he or she.  This creates problems for advocates of PC English.
How do you treat both genders fairly without such a pronoun?
People sometimes say, If a person wants to learn English, he should study every day.  In this sentence, he is supposed to mean he or she.
But studies show that when people read the word he, they visualize only a male.
So to treat both genders fairly, people change he to they and make the sentence plural: If people want to learn English, they should study every day.
PC English goes beyond gender.
It also includes issues of race and disabilities.
For example, some people prefer the term person with a disability to handicapped.
The word handicapped can be considered disrespectful because it implies that a person is helpless.
Changing ones language takes time, however, and some non-PC words are still frequently heard and used.
But if you dont want to offend someone, its best to try to avoid these words.
Some people think PC English has gone too far.
They dont like being told what words they have to use.
And they dont like changing their speech, just to make others feel better.
But most people agree that using respectful language is fair.
So they simply change with the times.
