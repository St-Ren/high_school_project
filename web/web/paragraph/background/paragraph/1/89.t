Unit 3  Inventing a Better World.
As an old saying goes, Necessity is the mother of invention. Many times, people come up with ideas to meet their own needs.
Later, the solutions to their problems may become great inventions that change our way of life.
The two examples below will perfectly explain this point.
Teng Hung-chi, who is a famous Taiwanese inventor, created his first invention when he was a vocational school student.
At that time, he was working as a factory mechanic.
One day, he was using the restroom in the factory.
His hands were dirty from work, so he did not want to touch the faucet.
He then hoped to design a special faucet which could run automatically without being touched.
Teng worked hard to put this idea into practice.
Before long, he invented a faucet that was controlled by a built-in sensing device.
At the time, he was only seventeen.
This young inventor later sold the rights to his invention for NT$1.5 million.
Since then, Teng has created many other useful inventions.
He has also represented Taiwan at the iENA exhibition, which is an international exhibition in Germany.
He has won first prize there many times.
For his many brilliant inventions, Teng has become known as Taiwans Edison.
The other wonderful modern invention that came from a simple need is the Post-it note.
Post-it was not successful at first.
In fact, it was the result of a failed experiment.
Spencer Silver, who was one of the inventors of the Post-it note, had tried to invent a strong glue.
Although he experimented with different chemicals, the results never met his expectationsXthe glue that he made turned out to be very weak.
He wasnt disappointed, though.
Instead, he tried to convince his co-workers of the usefulness of the weak glue, but they did not listen.
However, Silvers weak glue drew someones attention.
When Silvers co-worker Art Fry sang hymns during church services, his bookmarks fell out of his hymn book again and again, which really frustrated him.
One day, it occurred to him that using Silvers weak glue on a piece of paper might be able to help him mark the right page without damaging the book.
Then, he returned to the office and shared his thought with others in the company.
The Post-it note was born in 1980, and it has since successfully spread around the world.
As you can see, excellent inventors get ideas from their own experiences.
Next time you have a problem, try to think of a way to deal with it.
Perhaps you will also become a great inventor someday.
