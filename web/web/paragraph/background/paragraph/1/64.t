Rock climbing is a popular sport.
It trains climbers' use of their hands to hold their weight and to balance.
Sometimes the goal of the climber is to find an area to climb for the real pleasure of climbing; at other times, the goal is to climb a very difficult peak for the sense of accomplishment.
If you think that you have to go to the mountains to learn how to climb, you are wrong.
There are many places to learn rock climbing in the middle of a city.
Some people learn to climb on artificial rock walls in city gyms.
One can find climbing walls in parks, at schools, or even in coffee shops!
Remember, no matter where you go, you are sure to get some good exercise.
What do you need to wear to go climbing?
Here are some suggestions.
To climb, you need special shoes and a harness around your chest to hold you.
There are ropes to attach to your harness.
The ropes hold you securely so that you do not fall.
A beginner's wall is usually about fifteen feet high, and you climb straight up.
There are small pieces of metal that stick out for you to stand on and hold on to.
Sometimes it is easy to see the next piece of metal to choose.
Sometimes, it's not.
Most people have difficulty controlling their fear at first.
Fear of falling is a normal reaction, so it is difficult not to feel fear.
However, when you move away from the wall and find that you are held by the harness and the ropes, you begin to feel safe.
You move slowly until you arrive at the top.
At the top, the teacher slowly releases the rope, and then you slide back to the floor.
Your arms and legs feel tired, but you feel great.
Climbing attracts many people because it is good exercise for almost everyone.
Learning to climb is not very difficult.
You do not have to be a super athlete to climb a wall.
You use your whole body, especially your arms and legs.
This sport gives your body a complete exercise.
When you climb, you strengthen your mind as well as your body.
This is a sport for people who like a challenge.
