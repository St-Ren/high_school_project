Unit 9  A Rabbits Foot and a Piece of Wood.
Dear Diary,
I cant believe that Jonathan finally popped the question today!
Im engaged!
I was so happy that I called Angela and asked her to be one of my bridesmaids.
She screamed with me when she heard the news and said yes immediately.
And, oh, I MUST lose ten pounds before the wedding!
Ive got to look perfect on my wedding.
What this woman wrote in her diary might sound familiar to youXinviting the brides close friends to be her bridesmaids.
However, the origin of this custom may not be known by many people.
In Roman times, people believed that evil spirits might attend a wedding ceremony and hurt the bride.
Therefore, bridesmaids tried to cheat these unwanted visitors by dressing in almost the same way as the bride.
This is one superstition.
Can you think of any other superstition in everyday activities?
A superstition is a belief that one event can result inXor preventXanother, especially when the two are in no way related.
Take a rabbits foot.
Rabbits, unlike most other animals, touch the ground with their back feet first when they are running.
Many Westerners thus think that this is unusual and regard a rabbits foot as a lucky sign.
However, there is no scientific proof of this superstition.
Knocking on wood is another similar example.
Americans are used to saying knock on wood or actually doing so to prevent something bad from happening when they have just said it wont occur or hasnt occurred.
This is because they are afraid that tree spirits would affect their luck.
Many people stick to these beliefs because they tend to superstitiously associate one event with another.
In addition to the above superstitions for good luck, some customs that have long been practiced grow out of peoples fears.
Most people practice these customs to deal with the unknown.
In Taiwan, for instance, the word for the number four sounds like the word for death. Because of this association, the number four has long been viewed as an unlucky number by most Taiwanese people.
The reason why people in some Western countries often say Bless you when someone sneezes is also based on superstition.
In the past, they used to believe that devils might enter a persons body when that person sneezed.
Nowadays, because of changing ideas, some superstitious customs are practiced in different ways.
People are now turning to artificial feet of a rabbit to take the place of real ones, since this will help to stop the unnecessary killing of animals.
However, many people still find comfort in following superstition-based customs.
Though people are unable to predict the future, they still try their best to find a chance to control it.
