It is 9 p.m. on a pleasant summer evening and the sun is setting.
We are sitting on benches at a beach on Phillip Island.
Suddenly a small head pops out of the water.
Its a Little Penguin!
The Little Penguin stands up and walks out of the water, and then it starts to waddle up the beach.
Then, many more Little Penguins come out of the water, and they all follow the first penguin up the beach towards their homes.
They are all mother and father penguins, and they have been in the water all day catching fish for their babies.
Now they are returning to their homes to feed their hungry young children.
The tourists are excited to see the penguins.
Tonight there are about 700 Little Penguins altogether.
Little Penguins are the smallest penguins in the world.
When they are adults, they are only 33 centimeters tall and weigh only one kilogram.
They usually have two babies in the summertime each year, and they have to go fishing all day to get enough food to feed their babies.
Some days they have to swim up to 20 kilometers to catch the fish.
When they swim a long way, the penguins jump in and out of the water like dolphins.
In two months in summer they usually catch about 14 kilograms of fish.
That is a lot of fish for such small penguins!
The penguins live in holes in the ground called burrows.
Both parents dig the burrow together, and they make it comfortable for their babies by making a nest inside it out of grass, leaves and twigs.
First, the mother lays two eggs, and the parents take turns sitting on the eggs to keep them warm.
They do this for about 5 weeks.
Then the babies hatch from the eggs, and one parent stays at home to take care of the babies while the other parent goes out to search for fish each day.
The parents usually take turns doing this, too.
Little Penguins behave in other interesting ways, too.
When two penguins are angry with each other, they will stare at each other.
When one penguin is angry and the other one is not, the one who is not angry will look away from the other and walk away with its head and body held very low.
When Little Penguins want to attract a boyfriend or girlfriend, they will show they like the boy or girl by imitating what they do, or by cleaning the boy or girl penguins feathers.
The Little Penguins are fascinating to watch.
No wonder they have become one of the
most-loved animals in Australia!
