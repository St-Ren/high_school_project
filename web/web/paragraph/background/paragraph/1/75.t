David Gracer eats bugs.
Not any old kind of bug, but insects selected just like any other foodwfor sustenance and taste.
He eats them cooked in many ways.
At a time when reality television shows make contestants eat bugs to shock people, Gracer is one of a small but growing number of people really working to move beyond insects bad names.
By day, Gracer teaches writing at a community college, but by night, he visits chefs to show them that eating insects can be enjoyable and good for the planet.
Of course, humans have eaten bugs most of their existence.
The Greeks and the Romans ate them.
Many cultures in Asia, Africa, and the Americas still raise insects for food or collect them in the forest.
Gracer hopes that one day the United States will join in and have insect farms and begin turning insects into food.
After all, if Americans love shrimps and lobsters, why wont they eat their cousins that live on land?
One of the reasons why Americans are not willing to put insects on the table is because most of them fear insects.
Most Americans connect six-legged creatures with disease.
For example, mosquitoes cause dengue fever, and cockroaches are dirty.
However, insects in fact do not normally carry diseases that are terribly bad for people.
In the kitchen at an ice cream shop, David Gracer pushed a spoon into different insect-and-ice-cream combinations.
He picked up a grasshopper covered in burned caramel and said, Insects can feed the world.
That sounds interesting.
Raising insects is indeed better for the environment than raising cattle.
This is because they need to eat much less and use much less land.
Moreover, food made from insects contains much more protein that the human body can actually use than animal protein.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the idea of bugs as food is getting serious consideration from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)14.
FAO later held a course called Forest Insects as Food: Humans Bite Back in Thailand.
Among the questions addressed is: Bugs are more nutritious than the plants they eat on our farms.
So why do we kill them with pesticides?
We should have started eating them long ago.
