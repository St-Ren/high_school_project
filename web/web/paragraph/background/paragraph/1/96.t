Unit 1  Animal Imagery in Different Languages.
In many languages, certain animals have specific characteristics.
In Chinese, pigs are traditionally seen as clumsy animals; dogs represent loyalty; wolves indicate violence as well as cruelty; lions are a symbol of authority.
Likewise, animal imagery can be found in many English expressions, and it has given color to this language.
For instance, as quiet as a mouse is commonly used to describe a person who is quiet.
You can say, After being caught cheating on the exam, Samuel was as quiet as a mouse in front of his angry parents. However, if someone makes a lot of noise, an elephant would be a good choice for a simile.
As a result, a journalist may report, During the sale, the customers crowded into the mall like a herd of elephants. Whats more, if the phrase a white elephant is used to describe something, it means that this item is very expensive but useless.
Buying it will apparently be a waste of money because a white elephant costs a fortune but is of no use.
Another elephant-related expression is jumbo jet. Originally, jumbo was the word for elephant in an African language.
Later, it was taken as the name of the first circus elephant in the U.S.A. Jumbo gradually became a common name for elephants after the original Jumbos outstanding performances were appreciated by wide audiences.
For most English speakers, jumbo has come to share the meaning of the word big. Therefore, a huge jet plane is called a jumbo jet.
Aside from mice and elephants, birds and insects are often used in English expressions as well.
A person who is as proud as a peacock often gives others the impression that he or she is too proud of himself or herself.
When you call someone a chicken, you mean that the person is a coward and doesnt dare to do something.
Moreover, bees are commonly associated with diligence in English.
If a friend of yours is always working or tied up, then he or she is a busy bee or is always as busy as a bee.
Additionally, many sayings that include animal imagery also make English an interesting language.
The following are just a few examples:
When the cats away, the mice will play.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
There is a black sheep in every flock.
A leopard cannot change its spots.
As you have discovered, the use of animal imagery indeed plays a part in different languages.
Without a doubt, it not only makes a language fun to learn, but also helps language learners understand more about a languages culture.
