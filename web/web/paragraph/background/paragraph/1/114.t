Kacey McCallister always dreamed of playing basketball on the Boys Club team.
At first the coach wouldnt let him play, so Kacey practiced hard.
Now he is on the team, but he is not the best player.
This 11-year-old boy can dribble and pass as well as the other kids, but he moves up and down the court more slowly.
And shooting a basket is difficult for Kacey because he has no legs.
Kacey lost both legs in an accident.
When he was six, he ran into the street and a tractor-trailer hit him.
But Kacey doesnt let his physical challenge stop him from doing the things he loves.
He has learned to play many sports.
In basketball he dribbles the ball with one hand and uses his other hand to move his body around the court.
Kacey also plays baseball.
He can catch and throw the ball very well.
He can hit the ball well, too.
He is the teams catcher, so he doesnt have to move around so much.
Kacey is one of more than 50,000 physically challenged people in the United States who play sports.
These days physically challenged people are doing everything from biking and scuba diving to mountain climbing and rafting.
They are dancing and doing martial arts as well.
Some physically challenged people are great athletes.
With hard work and strong wills, they go beyond their physical challenges and make their dreams come true.
Sharon Hedrick was the first woman to race the Boston Marathon in a wheelchair.
She also competed in the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
There she won the womens wheelchair 800-meter race in record time.
Diana Golden became the U.S. Alpine Skier of the year skiing on one leg.
She came in 10th, racing against able-bodied skiers.
In 1988 the U.S. Olympic Committee named her Female Skier of the Year over all other racers, including able-bodied skiers.
The Paralympic Games are for physically challenged people.
In 1996, the Tenth Paralympic Games were held in Atlanta, Georgia, right after the summer Olympics.
Over 3,000 physically challenged athletes from around the world competed.
In Nagano, Japan, 1,000 athletes competed in winter sports at the Paralympic Games in 1998.
Everyone can learn something from physically challenged athletes like Kacey, Sharon, and Diana.
Kacey says, Dont let anything get you down.
Just play and have fun.
Dont let anybody tell you you cant do something.
Just say, I can!
