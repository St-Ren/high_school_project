Why do you need to learn English?
Well, why not?
Don't you want to read your favorite English novel instead of waiting for its Chinese translation?
Wouldn't you like to have a common means of communication with people anywhere in the world?
Of course!
Besides, using English well makes you feel good and look cool.
It lets you stand tall.
That's why you are among the one billion English learners on this planet.
English is one of the most commonly used languages in the world.
Over one-third of the world's population speaks it to some degree.
About seventy-five countries use it as the major language of government, education, and business.
English is also the number one foreign language in most of the other countries.
We can hardly imagine life without English.
English is the main language of books, the news media, sports, pop music, science, air-traffic control, and international business.
Three-quarters of the world's mail is in English, and ninety percent of the information on the Internet is also in English.
As a widely used language, English is in fact very "international."
It has borrowed many words from other languages in the world.
For example, "sugar," "zero," "coffee," and "orange" are from Arabic; "banana," "jazz," and "zebra" from African languages; "tsunami," "karaoke," and "sushi" from Japanese.
And from Chinese, we can find the words "tea" and "ketchup."
Thus, if you want to connect with the world, English would be your best choice.

As a famous language researcher, David Crystal, once said, "You don't need long arms to embrace the world; you need English."
