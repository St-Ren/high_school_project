Diving with Courage.
I like scuba diving.
The ideas for my paintings all come from the ocean I dive in. This may sound like an ordinary sentence from an ordinary painter.
However, it comes from a man without arms.
Chen Shih-feng enjoys scuba diving and fishing in the sea.
Surprisingly, he moves much better than those who have arms.
My first scuba diving teachers refused to go underwater with me, Chen said.
One must have an oxygen hose in ones mouth when swimming underwater.
Therefore, sign language is the only way to communicate with people in the water.
Chen was unlucky because he did not have arms.
Finally, he was able to persuade two coaches to go with him.
By using my feet and their hands, we are speaking another kind of sign language.
When Chen was 14, a terrible accident happened to him.
Electrical shocks caused him to lose both his arms.
Chen, who had a talent for the arts when young, decided to become a painter and hold the brush in his mouth.
In the beginning, he faced all sorts of difficulties.
He had to pick up a brush with his mouth and paint.
I would commonly drip my saliva all over, Chen said.
After he finished painting, he would bend under a faucet to wash the brush.
Then he would shake his head in order to get the water out of the brush.
His face would become totally wet from the water and paint.
People often asked him whether he was trying to paint on the canvas or on his own body.
In 1988, Chen became a member of an international federation of foot and mouth painters.
He is good at painting nature scenes and still lifes.
Besides, he especially likes to use carp as a subject.
He has accomplished what he has today through his hard work and courage.
Always show a passion for life and never give up. This is how Chen encourages people in his position to move on.
