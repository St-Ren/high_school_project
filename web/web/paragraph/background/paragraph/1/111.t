A high school science teacher wants to demonstrate a concept to his students.
He takes a large-mouthed jar and places several large rocks in it.
He then asks the class, Is it full?
The whole class replies, Yes!
The teacher then takes a bucket of gravel and pours it into the jar.
The small rocks settle into the spaces between the big rocks.
He then asks the class, Is it full?
This time some students hold back, but most reply, Yes!
The teacher then produces a large can of sand and pours it into the jar.
The sand fills up the spaces between the bits of gravel.
For the third time, the teacher asks, Is it full?
Now most of the students are wary of answering, but again, many reply, Yes!
Then the teacher brings out a pitcher of water and pours it into the jar.
The water saturates the sand.
At this point the teacher asks the class, What is the point of this demonstration?
One bright young student raises his hand and then answers, No matter how full ones schedule is in life, one can always squeeze in more things!
Very good, replies the teacher, but the most important point is that unless you put the big rocks into the jar first, you are never going to get them in.
The big rocks are the important things in your lifeXyour family, your friends, your personal growth.
If you fill your life with small things, like the gravel, the sand, and the water, you will never have space for the important things.
So, what are the big rocks in your life?
Spending time with your family?
Taking classes to get the information you need?
Making time for school clubs?
When you feel that you dont have enough time for everything, remember the story about the big rocks and the jar!
