Unit 5  A Recipe for a Delicious Friendship.
Everyone wants to have friends.
But do you know that making friends can be a lot like making soup?
That is, to enjoy a close friendship with another person, you have to act like a good chef.
First, you need a special recipe to tell you the things that you need.
Next, you have to prepare everything properly and then cook it carefully.
Friendship Soup
Like tomato soup, only
Better, more
Satisfying, and
Good for your soul.
All you need is a can of love,
Opened with a smile,
Poured into a bowl of good
environment and similar interests,
Mixed with: a
Cup of compliments,
3 cups of talking,
5 cups of time togetherX
House visits,
2 teaspoons of support,
3 cups of trust,
A shoulder to cry on,
A basket of hugs,
3 tons of encouragement,
And dont forgetXa
Bit of nuttiness!
The poem you read on the left page was written by a fourteen-year old student.
It is about friendship, and it is called Friendship Soup.
The poem shows that if you want to be someones good friend, you have to make an effort.
You cannot just sit back and wait for it to happen.
Like a good chef, you have to add some seasoning to make the soup a tasty dish.
The poem also indicates that friendship requires many different ingredients.
For instance, trust and similar interests are very important.
If you really trust your friends, you can talk to them about any problem that you run into and share your feelings with them.
If you and your friends have similar interests, you can spend more time doing things that you are both fond of.
In addition to trust and similar interests, friendship needs care as well.
You cant leave it alone, just as you cant leave soup on the stove unattended.
Friendship, like soup, needs your time and attention, too.
Though having a friend keeps you busy, it also makes you happy.
A good friend, like a bowl of good soup, can be just what you need when you feel down.
Therefore, when it comes to keeping old friendships and starting new ones, remember that making friends can be a lot like making soupXit may take time and effort, but it is always worth it.
