Unit 4  Tips for Improving Your Memory.
Study shows that most problems with memory grow out of bad habits.
For example, if you develop the habit of not making an effort to remember things, your ability to memorize will begin to decrease.
On the other hand, a good memory can be the result of good habits.
To improve your memory, you should change the way you deal with information.
Here are some tips that may assist you in getting on the right track.
Set realistic goals.
Do not expect to remember everything.
If you have memory problems in particular areas, focus on them first.
After you have achieved some success in those areas, move on to others.Stay mentally active.
Exercising your mind is the best way to keep it sharp.
If you tend to avoid mental challenges and always choose the easiest solutions, it will become difficult for you to depend on your memory to solve challenging problems.Cut down on activities that dont require you to think.
Watching TV is an activity that most people do too much.
Many TV programs require no mental input at all.
The more time you spend on these programs, the more easily you pick up the habit of turning off your brain.Read more.
Reading provides one of the best ways to exercise your brain.
Whether you are busy working or studying, you should spare some time to read.
When you read, you have to actively use your memory to recognize words and arrange them into phrases, then sentences, and then ideas.
The more often you read, the more mental workouts you get.Get into the habit of taking notes.
Whether you are reading, studying, or listening to a speech, it is useful to write down the information you may want to look up later.
In the process of writing down what is mentioned, you are actually organizing information, which often helps you to recall it better.Try something unfamiliar.
You should occasionally try new things or learn something that interests youXand not just try to get high scores on exams.
Learn a new sport, a musical instrument, or a new language.
Your brain may grow lazy if you dont exercise it with new activities every now and then.Teach others what you know.
Teaching others helps you strengthen your knowledge by forcing you to think about the reasons and connections concerning the information you are sharing.
Many people who have practiced the tips above have noticed great improvements in their memories.
However, everyone is unique, and the results may vary from person to person.
What matters more than these tips is to find out what works best for you.
