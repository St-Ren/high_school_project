Lesson One   General1 MacArthur°¶s2 Prayer for His Son. °@°@Build me a son, O Lord3, who will be strong enough to know when he is weak, and brave1 enough to face2 himself when he is afraid; one who will be proud and unbending4 in honest defeat3, and humble4 and gentle5 in victory6. °@°@Build me a son whose wishbone5 will not be where his backbone6 should be; a son who will know Thee7°Xand that to know himself is the foundation stone of knowledge7. °@°@Lead him, I pray, not in the path of ease8 and comfort, but under the stress9 and spur8 of difficulties10 and challenge. Here let him learn to stand up in the storm; here let him learn compassion11 for those who fail. °@°@ °@°@Build me a son whose heart will be clear, whose goal will be high; a son who will master12 himself before he seeks13 to master other men; one who will learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep14; one who will reach into the future, yet never forget the past. °@°@And after all these things are his, add, I pray, enough of a sense of humor, so that he may always be serious, yet never take himself too seriously. Give him humility15, so that he may always remember the simplicity16 of true greatness, the open mind of true wisdom17, the meekness18 of true strength. °@°@Then, I, his father, will dare19 to whisper, °ßI have not lived in vain!°®  
Lesson Twelve   One More Chance, Please. °@°@Agony1 claws2 my mind. I am a statistic3. When I first got here, I felt very much alone. I was overwhelmed4 by grief5, and I expected to find sympathy6. °@°@ °@°@I found no sympathy. I saw only thousands of others whose bodies were as badly1 mangled2 as mine. I was given a number and placed7 in a category. The category was called °ßtraffic fatalities8.°® °@°@ °@°@The day I died was an ordinary9 school day. How I wish I had taken the bus! But I was too cool for the bus. I remember how I wheedled10 the car out of Mom. °ßSpecial favor11,°® I pleaded. °ßAll the kids drive.°® When the 2:50 p.m. bell rang, I threw my books in the locker. Free until tomorrow morning! I ran to the parking lot, excited at the thought of driving a car and being my own boss. °@°@ °@°@It doesn°¶t matter how the accident happened. I was goofing off°Xgoing too fast, taking crazy12 chances. But I was enjoying my freedom13 and having fun. The last thing I remember was passing an old lady3 who seemed to be going awfully14 slow. I heard a crash15 and felt a terrific16 jolt4. Glass and steel flew everywhere. My whole body seemed to be turning inside out. I heard myself scream. °@°@ °@°@Suddenly, I awakened. It was very quiet. A police officer was standing over me. I saw a doctor. My body was mangled. I was saturated with blood17. Pieces of jagged5 glass were sticking out all over. Strange that I couldn°¶t feel anything. Hey, don°¶t pull that sheet over my head. I can°¶t be dead. I°¶m only 17. I°¶ve got a date tonight. I°¶m supposed to have a wonderful life ahead of me. I haven°¶t lived yet. I can°¶t be dead. °@°@ °@°@Later I was placed in a drawer. My folks18 came to identify19 me. Why did they have to see me like this? Why did I have to look at Mom°¶s eyes when she faced the most terrible ordeal6 of her life? Dad suddenly looked very old. He told the man in charge, °ßYes°Xhe is our son.°® °@°@ °@°@The funeral20 was weird21. I saw all my relatives22 and friends walk toward the casket7. They looked at me with the saddest eyes I had ever seen. Some of my buddies8 were crying. A few of the girls touched my hand and sobbed as they walked by. °@°@ °@°@Please°Xsomebody°Xwake me up! Get me out of here. I can°¶t bear23 to see Mom and Dad in such pain. My grandparents9 are so weak from grief they can barely walk. My brother and sister are like zombies10. They move like robots11. In a daze. Everybody. No one can believe this. I can°¶t believe it, either. °@°@ °@°@Please don°¶t bury24 me! I°¶m not dead! I have a lot of living to do! I want to laugh and run again. I want to sing and dance. Please don°¶t put me in the ground! I promise if you give me just one more chance, God, I°¶ll be the most careful driver in the whole world. All I want is one more chance. Please, God, I°¶m only 17. 
Chiufen: A Cultural Treasure of Taiwan °@°@The town of Chiufen1, located on a mountainside2 overlooking1 the Pacific Ocean3, is regarded as one of Taiwan°¶s unique cultural treasures. A visit here offers2 a chance to escape from the roaring4 traffic and daily bustle3 of city life, and a chance to let the imagination wander back in time. Old brick buildings, packed intimately4 together, one row built just above the other, offer a charming, relaxed view. Narrow, dark alleyways5, paved5 in stone that is now worn down by the foot and carriage6 traffic of many decades, suggest an old-fashioned way of life. The whole place has a picturesque7 and romantic8 air about it. °@°@ °@°@Just as picturesque and romantic as the scenery9 of Chiufen is the story behind it. In the past century, the town has undergone10 several dramatic changes. Beginning as a tiny, unknown village, it grew into a booming11 gold mining12 town, then later became a peaceful artists°¶ colony13, and finally one of the major14 tourist attractions in northern Taiwan. Indeed, it is this fascinating past that has made the town so popular today. °@°@ °@°@Chiufen started out as a remote15 mountain community16 with only nine families. In fact, it is from these nine families that Chiufen derives its name, which in English means °ßnine portions17.°® Because the village was almost impossible to get to by road, whenever anyone made the long trip to town for provisions18, they would always bring back nine portions of each item, one for each family. °@°@ °@°@This simple way of life changed almost overnight19 in the 1890s, when gold was discovered in Chiufen. Hoping to get rich quick, people flocked to the town, which came to be known as °ßthe gold capital of Asia.°® By the 1930s, the town had grown to between 3,000 and 4,000 homes. The tiny streets were now lined with homes and many different kinds of stores and restaurants. The city even boasted20 the first theater in all of northern Taiwan. Before long, sleepy Chiufen had become what people called °ßLittle Shanghai6.°® °@°@ °@°@For many people, however, life in Chiufen was not easy. Many of them had very dirty and dangerous jobs in the dark gold mines. Nevertheless21, the relatively22 good wages°Xand the thought of finding their own gold°Xkept miners at the job. What°¶s more, their free-spending ways enabled23 Chiufen to continue to prosper24. °@°@ °@°@Within just a few decades, however, this way of life disappeared. By the 1960s, the gold was nearly gone; eventually, the mines were abandoned25, people moved away, and Chiufen was almost forgotten. But not completely°Xas far as some people were concerned, especially artists and poets, the town remained as attractive as ever. Its peaceful seaside location and beautiful scenery, complete with springtime cherry blossoms7, cool summer breezes8, swaying9 autumn grasses, and romantic winter rains, were ideal26 for anyone in search of inspiration. When painters began holding exhibitions27 around the island that showed the landscape of Chiufen, more people began to take notice, and when some filmmakers10 began to make movies in Chiufen, the town°¶s fame continued to grow. °@°@ °@°@Today, Chiufen is once again enjoying a new life, this time as a tourist destination28. Visitors can now relax in one of the many teahouses that are hidden in the alleyways, stroll along Chishan Street11 and sample29 the taro balls12 and other local snacks, or spend a quiet evening at an old-style inn13, watching the sun set over the mountains. Perhaps most of all, they can get a feeling of what the town was like nearly a century ago. Chiufen may no longer be rich in gold, but it is still rich in history. °@°@ 
Ôªø   Ali and his younger sister, Zahra, lived with their parents in a poor neighborhood. Their mother was very sick and their father was struggling to find a job, and they had only a little money with which to buy food.  As they had not paid the rent for several months, the landlord was breathing down their neck. „ÄÄ„ÄÄOne day, Ali took Zahra‚Äôs shoes to a shoe repairman to be fixed, but he lost them on the way home.  It wasn‚Äôt until he got home that he realized he had lost the shoes.  He was afraid that his parents would be angry and disappointed, so he begged his sister to keep it a secret. Zahra agreed and the two decided to share Ali‚Äôs old running shoes.  Zahra‚Äôs school hours were in the morning, so she would wear them first.  After school, she would rush back and give them to Ali.  He could then run to his school, which began in the afternoon.  Although he ran as fast as he could, Ali often arrived late and was warned by the school. „ÄÄ„ÄÄA few weeks later, Zahra noticed one of her classmates was wearing her shoes that Ali had lost. When she and Ali followed the young girl home, they discovered that her family was even poorer than theirs. Ali and Zahra were so filled with pity and compassion that they couldn‚Äôt ask the girl to return the shoes. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAli heard about a long-distance race that was held for the boys in the city. When he learned that the third prize was a new pair of shoes, he decided to take part. He ran home excitedly and promised his sister that he would win her the new shoes. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe day of the race arrived. Ali had a strong start, but halfway through the race he began to get tired and his legs began to ache. Getting more and more exhausted, he thought only of Zahra and his promise to her. Dreaming of the new shoes he would win for his sister gave him strength, and he stayed right behind the two fastest runners, determined to finish third. Suddenly, as the finish line drew near, another runner collided* with Ali from behind and he crashed to the ground. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAli looked up and saw the other boys rushing ahead. Refusing to give up at this point, he jumped to his feet and ran as fast as he could. He dashed across the finish line and won the race! The spectators cheered wildly and took pictures of Ali during the award ceremony, but Ali was sobbing. If he had come in third, he could have won the prize he wanted. And now he couldn‚Äôt go home with the new shoes. He had let his sister down. „ÄÄ„ÄÄFilled with sorrow, Ali walked home slowly and found his sister eagerly waiting outside.  He didn‚Äôt say a word, but Zahra knew immediately from his face that Ali didn‚Äôt bring home what she was expecting. She ran inside, leaving Ali alone at the door. „ÄÄ„ÄÄNeither of the kids knew that their father was riding home from work, with two new pairs of shoes on the back of his bicycle.
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄSome poets may play with rhymes to make poems fun to read. Others may use beautiful language to declare their love in romantic verses. Still others compose poems to show their talent for storytelling. They do so by telling stories in fewer words but with more meanings.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen writing a story in the form of poetry, poets carefully choose their words and leave only the most crucial clues. If readers are good detectives, inquisitive and also imaginative , they will be able to piece together the whole story. So as you read, you must keep asking questions, pay attention to unusual details, and try to find the answers from the clues.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄTo better understand a narrative* poem, we can start with an analysis of some basic elements of stories: the setting*, the characters or the speaker, and the plot . Here are some questions that you may ask about these elements:  ‚Ä¢ About the setting:  When and where is the story taking place?  What is the situation?  ‚Ä¢ About the characters or the speaker:  Who are the characters in the story?  What traits do you think they have?  Who might be the speaker that tells you the story?  What is the tone of the speaker?  ‚Ä¢ About the plot:  What do you think may happen to the characters?  What problem(s) do they have?  What do they do to deal with it/them?  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe following are two narrative poems, each telling a unique story. Now you may use what you have learned above to read the stories told in the form of poems on the next page.  When I Was One-and-Twenty W hen I was one-and-twenty I heard a wise man say, ‚ÄòGive crowns* and pounds and guineas* But not your heart away; Give pearls away and rubies But keep your fancy free.‚Äô But I was one-and-twenty, No use to talk to me. When I was one-and-twenty I heard him say again, ‚ÄòThe heart out of the bosom Was never given in vain; ‚ÄôTis paid with sighs a plenty And sold for endless rue*.‚Äô And I am two-and-twenty, And oh, ‚Äôtis true, ‚Äôtis true. ‚îÄA. E. Housman*(-)‚îÄ Teevee I n the house of Mr. and Mrs. Spouse he and she would watch teevee and never a word between them spoken until the day the set was broken Then ‚ÄúHow do you do?‚Äù said he to she, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve met yet. Spouse is my name. What‚Äôs yours?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúWhy, mine is the same!‚Äù said she to he, ‚ÄúDo you suppose that we could be‚îÄ?‚Äù But then the set came suddenly right about And so they never did find out. 
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄRecycle your cell phones, and you may rescue African gorillas. What kind of connection, you may ask, could there possibly be here? Well, to understand this connection, we first need to know what problems your cell phones might cause. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThere are already billions of cell phone users worldwide, and the number is still increasing. Many users even have more than one cell phone. The average lifespan* of a cell phone, according to many studies, is less than two years, so billions of cell phones are out of use every year. „ÄÄ„ÄÄHave you ever wondered what happens to all these old cell phones? In fact, 2% of old cell phones will simply be thrown away. Another 7% are lying around in people‚Äôs drawers, and may also end up in landfills*. In other words, 9% of old cell phones are treated as trash, although most of them are still usable. Only 5% are recycled. Among these recycled cell phones, some are refurbished* for resale, and some are donated for charity or emergency use. The rest are broken into their essential elements for other uses. „ÄÄ„ÄÄYou may already know why it is important that old cell phones be recycled. Cell phones contain many dangerous chemicals, such as copper or lead. They are known as Persistent, Bioaccumulative*, and Toxic Chemicals (PBTs*), which will stay in our environment for a long time and harm living creatures. Some people, however, are imaginative enough to believe recycling old cell phones may have something to do with the well-being* of far-away African gorillas. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe key to such a connection lies in one of the PBTs, called coltan*, which is widely used in cell phones. Eighty percent of the world‚Äôs known coltan supply is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo*, in central Africa, which is also home to the world‚Äôs endangered gorillas. In order to mine the coltan, workers often overrun and destroy the once-protected* gorilla habitat. Over the period of just a few years, there has been a 9% decline in the gorilla population. „ÄÄ„ÄÄBecause of the worldwide cell phone boom, the increasing demand for coltan is unavoidable. However, what about the future of these endangered gorillas? The Santa Barbara Zoo* and 8 other zoos across the United States hope to come to their rescue. They are running a program that highlights this connection between coltan and gorillas. They educate people to recycle their old cell phones, hoping to reduce the demand for coltan. They refurbish the collected old cell phones for resale, and use the money to support rescue projects for the gorillas. „ÄÄ„ÄÄMaybe it is over-optimistic to assume that recycling old cell phones can rescue the gorillas from extinction. However, this program raises public awareness that it is negligent to throw away outdated* cell phones instead of recycling them. Not only does it pollute the environment, but it endangers the survival of a species somewhere on our planet. So think twice before you get a new cell phone. If you do need a new one, be sure to recycle your old one.
The Influence of the Stars. °@°@ It was a brand-new school year. Sitting in the homeroom, Christine was looking around to find someone she could make friends with. Soon she noticed Josephine, who was confident when she answered their teacher°¶s questions. Josephine also acted like a leader, helping the teacher collect different forms. Later, during the students°¶ introductions, Linda impressed Christine with her ability to make fair comments. On the other hand, when it was time to vote on class chores, Christine was surprised to see how shy and indecisive Steven was. Christine wondered whether she could get along well with him. °@°@A few days later, Christine told her older sister Jane what she had noticed on the first day of school. Jane, who had been interested in astrology since entering college, asked Christine to find out when her classmates were born. Then, she checked in her books to find their astrological signs and the corresponding personality traits.  °@°@Josephine is a Leo. A Leo is as confident as a lion and likes to be the center of attention. People born under this sign are excellent leaders because they are systematic. They think highly of themselves, but they are still willing to help those in need. Just like Christine, Josephine is outgoing. Thus, Christine believes Josephine will be easy to make friends with. °@°@Linda is a Libra. Libras emphasize logic and they strictly follow rules. Thus, a Libra is a perfect match for an Aquarius like Christine, because an Aquarius tends to stick to the rules as well. Like a Libra, an Aquarius enjoys having a busy social life and appreciates beautiful things. °@°@Steven is a Cancer, and Cancers are emotional. People born under this sign lack confidence and often feel insecure. They always need companions, while those born under the sign of Aquarius enjoy freedom. However, there are good things about Cancers, too. They love their families and are the best money managers among the twelve signs. °@°@After reading her sister°¶s astrology books, Christine felt she had gained knowledge about both herself and her classmates. She could now understand more about her classmates and their individual differences, and she felt more confident that she would be able to get along with them. It seemed that this new school year was opening its arms wide to welcome her!                                                       °–Pamela Brown 
How Can You Buy or Sell the Sky? °@°@How can you buy or sell the sky, the warmth of the land? The idea is strange to us. °@°@If we do not own the freshness of the air and the sparkle of the water, how can you buy them?  °@°@Every part of this earth is sacred to my people. Every shining pine needle, every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every clearing and humming insect is holy in the memory and experience of my people. The sap which courses through the trees carries the memories of the red man.  °@°@When the Great Chief in Washington sends word that he wishes to buy our land, he asks much of us. The Great Chief sends word he will reserve us a place so that we can live comfortably by ourselves. He will be our father and we will be his children. °@°@So we will consider your offer to buy our land. But it will not be easy. For this land is sacred to us. This shining water that moves in the streams and rivers is not just water but the blood of our ancestors. If we sell you our land, you must remember that it is sacred, and you must teach your children that it is sacred and that each ghostly reflection in the clear water of the lakes tells of events and memories in the life of my people. The water's murmur is the voice of my father's father.  °@°@The rivers are our brothers; they quench our thirst. The rivers carry our canoes, and feed our children. If we sell you our land, you must remember, and teach your children, that the rivers are our brothers and yours, and you must henceforth give the rivers the kindness you would give any brother.  °@°@I am a savage and do not understand any other way. I have seen a thousand rotting buffaloes on the prairie, left by the white man who shot them from a passing train. I am a savage and do not understand how the smoking iron horse can be made more important than the buffalo that we kill only to stay alive. °@°@What is man without beasts? If all the beasts were gone, man would die from a great loneliness of the spirit. For whatever happens to the beasts soon happens to man. All things are connected.  °@°@You must teach your children that the ground beneath their feet is the ashes of our grandfathers. Tell your children that the earth is rich with the lives of our kin so that you can make them respect the land. Teach your children that we have taught our children that the earth is our mother. Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of the earth. If men spit upon the ground, they spit upon themselves.  °@°@This we know: the earth does not belong to man; man belongs to the earth. All things are connected. We may be brothers after all. 
°@°@Steve Biko1, the third child in a black family, was born in South Africa. His father was a clerk and his mother was a maid. Biko did not have the opportunity to know his father because he died when Biko was only four years old. Steve Biko did extremely well in school as a youth1 but his political activities caused him to be kicked out of high school. Biko was nevertheless able to continue on to college because he received a scholarship2 to study  medicine in St. Francis College, a Catholic2 boarding school3. While in medical school, Biko became involved3 in the NUSAS4 (National Union4 of South African Students), a multiracial5, politically moderate5 organization.  It was while he was at St. Francis that Biko began questioning the apartheid system6 and the conditions that his people were forced to endure6. To  fight those conditions, he became more involved in the daily struggle7 that blacks7 faced, and he decided to quit8 medical school. °@°@In 1968, Steve Biko helped form the all-Black South African Students°¶ Organization and became its first president. The main aim of the organization was to raise black consciousness in South Africa through lectures9 and community activities. Biko felt that the apartheid system had a mental10 effect on the black population11. It had caused blacks to believe that they were inferior to whites, and it resulted in the lack of hope that black people felt. Biko encouraged blacks to °ßbreak the chains12 of oppression13.°® °@°@Biko°¶s political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African government, which resulted in him being banned14 in 1973. The banning restricted15 Biko from talking to more than one person at a time. Its aim was to try to stop the rising16 political movement17. However, it did not stop Biko°¶s work. For the next four years, he continued to spread his message with his publication called °ßFrank18 Talk.°® During this period Biko was often harassed19, arrested20, and held by the South African Police.  °@°@On August 18, 1977, Biko was seized by the police and held under Section 6 of the Terrorism Act8. Biko was held in prison21 for twenty-four days where he was questioned, starved22, and beaten23. It was not until Biko was lying unconscious24 that the doctors suggested that he be transported to the capital city for medical treatment, 740 miles away. On September 12, 1977, Biko became the forty-first person in South Africa to die while being held by the South African Police. °@°@The South African government stated that Steve Biko°¶s death was caused by a hunger25 strike and that they were not guilty of any wrongdoing9. However, the official report showed that Biko°¶s death was caused by brain injury26 from the °ßapplication27 of force to the head.°® Biko°¶s tragic death had a great effect on the people of South Africa and shocked the world. His funeral28 was attended by more than 15,000 people, not including the thousands that were turned away by the police. The memory of Steve Biko lives on through the struggle he helped to start and through the freedom that South Africans now possess29. 
°@°@On July 20, 1969, Buzz Aldrin2 was one of the first men to take a step on the moon. On March 28, 2007, he was the first to step on the Skywalk at the Grand Canyon3 West in the U.S. state of Arizona4. Speaking to a packed crowd of media and VIP guests, Aldrin said, °ßIt was not quite like walking on air, but a wonderful vision1 and a vision of hope for the future.°® °@°@The vision can be traced2 back to 1996. David Jin5, a Las Vegas6 businessman from Shanghai7, China, approached the Hualapai8 tribe, the Indians9 who own the Grand Canyon West, with a plan to build a skywalk with his own money. Jin said he thought it would be really amazing to be able to walk out over the canyon. Construction3 began in March 2004 and the Skywalk was finally rolled to the edge4 of the canyon on March 7, 2007 after passing several days of testing. °@°@The completed Skywalk is truly amazing. It hangs 1,200 meters5 above the floor of the canyon, giving visitors a view from more than twice as high as Taipei 101. It projects6 20 meters beyond the  edge of the canyon. With its walls and floor  built from glass 10.2 centimeters thick7, the  Skywalk is capable8 of holding 70 tons9 of weight (about 800  people weighing 80 kilograms each); however, no more than  120 people can be on it at one time. Visitors are provided  with shoe covers to protect them from slipping10 and to  prevent11 the glass floor from being damaged. °@°@The construction of the Skywalk alone cost more  than US$40 million. Under Jin°¶s plan, the Hualapai tribe  owns the Skywalk, but he collects up to half of the money  from ticket sales for the next 25 years. Future plans for  the Grand Canyon Skywalk include a visitors°¶ center,  museum, movie theater, gift shop, and several restaurants,  including an expensive restaurant called The Skywalk Caf?,  where visitors will be able to eat outside. 	However, the planning and construction of the Skywalk has caused controversy12 within the Hualapai tribe as well as between the tribe and outside groups. Opponents13 within the tribe view the project as disturbing14 sacred  ground. The Hualapai believe their ancestors emerged16 from the earth of the Grand Canyon, and many of the tribe°¶s sacred sites for the dead are in the area. People outside of the tribe, including Arizona environmental groups and former National Park officials, have complained the Skywalk takes away the natural beauty of the environment. Some have suggested it is ironic17 that the Hualapai had argued they took good care of the Grand Canyon, and yet decided to use it in this way. °@°@The tribe leaders argue that it is an opportunity to generate much-needed  cash to combat18 serious problems in this area, including a 50 percent unemployment19 rate20, alcohol21 abuse22, and poverty. As for the environmental concerns, they argue that the Grand Canyon National Park is already polluted by the 4.5 million people a year. In addition, the Hualapai are completely dependent23 on the visitors who come to the reservation24 each year. With the construction of the Skywalk, their reservation can attract more tourists25 and the income26 can solve their problems. °@°@Is the Skywalk helping get the Hualapai out of their financial27 troubles? Since the opening of the Skywalk, Grand Canyon West has been experiencing a record number of 3,000 visitors every day. So, like it or not, the Skywalk is definitely28 a money-maker. 
°@°@When I was quite young, my family had one of the first telephones in our neighborhood. I remember well the polished1 oak case on the wall at the bottom of the stairs2. The shiny receiver3 hung on the side of the box. I even remember the number°X105. Hearing my mother talk to it was fascinating to me. °@°@Then I discovered that somewhere inside that wonderful device4 lived an amazing person¢wher name was °ßInformation Please°® and there was nothing she did not know. My mother could ask her for anybody°¶s number; when our clock ran down, Information Please immediately5 supplied6 the correct time.  °@°@My first personal experience with this incredible7 being8 came one day while my mother was visiting a neighbor. Amusing myself with some tools in the basement9, I slammed10 one on my finger. The pain was terrible, but there was no one home to offer sympathy11. I walked around the house with my sore finger in my mouth until I heard a sound. The telephone! Quickly I ran for something to stand on and dragged13 a chair to the landing. Climbing up, I took the receiver and held it to my ear. °ßInformation Please,°® I said to the mouthpiece1 just above my head.  °@°@A click or two, and a small, clear voice spoke into my ear. °ßInformation.°® °@°@°ßI hurt my finger¢w°® I screamed into the phone. °ßNobody°¶s home but me,°® I cried now that I had an audience14.  °@°@°ßAre you bleeding?°®  °@°@°ßNo,°® I replied. °ßI hit it with a hammer and it hurts.°® °@°@°ßCan you get some ice from the freezer?°® she asked. I said I could.  °@°@°ßThen get a little piece of ice and hold it on your finger. That will stop the hurt. Don°¶t cry. You°¶ll be all right,°® she said. °@°@After that, I called Information Please for everything. I asked for help with my lessons and she told me where famous places were¢wincluding the romantic15 river I was going to explore when I grew up. She even helped me with my math. °@°@And there was the time that Petey2, our pet bird, died. I called Information Please and told her the sad story. She listened and said the usual things adults would say to make a child feel better. But I was feeling hopeless: °ßWhy was it that birds should sing so beautifully and bring joy to the whole family, only to end up as a pile of feathers16 feet up?°®  °@°@She must have sensed my deep concern, for she said quietly, °ßPaul, always remember that there are other worlds to sing in.°®  °@°@Somehow17 I felt better.  °@°@Another day, °ßInformation,°® said the now familiar18 voice.  °@°@°ßHow do you spell fix?°® I asked.  °@°@°ßFix something? F-I-X.°®  °@°@At that instant19 my sister, who took unholy3 joy in scaring20 me, jumped off the stairs at me. I fell off the chair, pulling the receiver out of the box by its roots. We were both shocked°XInformation Please was no longer there, and I was not at all sure that I had not hurt her when I pulled the receiver out. °@°@Minutes later there was a man on the porch. °ßI°¶m a telephone man. I was working down the street and the operator21 said there might be some trouble at this number. What happened?°® °@°@I told him, and he said, °ßWell, we can fix that in a minute or two.°® He opened the telephone box, exposing22 wires23 and coils24, and worked for a while on the end of the receiver cord25. He moved the hook up and down a few times, then spoke into the phone. °ßHi, this is Pete. Everything°¶s under control at 105. The kid°¶s sister scared him and he pulled the cord out of the box.°® °@°@All this took place in a small town in the northwest. Then, when I was nine years old, we moved across the country°Xand I missed my guide26 acutely27. Information Please belonged in that old wooden box back home, and I somehow never thought of trying the tall, thin new phone that sat on a small table in the hall28 of our new house. °@°@I often missed the conversations and recalled the sense of security I had when I knew that I could call Information Please and get the right answer. °@°@A few years later, on my way west to college, my plane stopped in Seattle not far from where I lived when I was little. I had about half an hour between connections, and I spent about 15 minutes on the phone with my sister who lived there now. Then, really without thinking what I was doing, I called the operator in my hometown and said, °ßInformation Please.°®  °@°@Amazingly, I heard again the small, clear voice I knew so well: °ßInformation.°®  °@°@I had not planned this, but I heard myself asking, °ßCould you tell me, please, how to spell the word °•fix°¶?°® °@°@There was a long pause. Then came the softly spoken answer. °ßI guess,°® said Information Please, °ßthat your finger must have healed by now.°®  °@°@I laughed. °ßSo it°¶s really still you. I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during all that time....°® °@°@°ßI wonder,°® she replied, °ßif you know how much you meant to me. I never had any children, and I used to look forward to your calls.°® °@°@I told her how often I had thought of her over the years, and I asked if I could call her again. °@°@°ßPlease do. Just ask for Sally.°®  °@°@Just three months later I was back at the Seattle airport. A different voice answered, °ßInformation,°® and I asked for Sally.  °@°@°ßAre you a friend?°®  °@°@°ßYes,°® I said. °ßAn old friend. Paul Villard4.°®	 °@°@°ßThen I°¶m sorry to have to tell you. Sally had only been working  part-time5 in the last few years because she was ill. She died five weeks ago.°® But before I could hang up, she said, °ßWait a minute. Did you say your name was Villard?°®  °@°@°ßYes.°® °@°@°ßWell, Sally left a message for you. She wrote it down.°® °@°@°ßWhat was it?°® I asked, almost knowing in advance what it would be.  °@°@°ßHere it is, I°¶ll read it°X °•Tell him I still say there are other worlds to sing in.

Unit 10  Death by Tourism. 	At the entrance to one of the temples of Petra in Jordan, something is carved deeply into the soft red rock. At first glance, it looks like it has been there for centuries. It could have been written by King Herod°¶s soldiers, when they were confined here in 40 B.C. But closer inspection reveals that it is not so ancient after all. It reads: 	Shane and Wendy from Sydney were here. April 16th 1996. 	The ruins of Petra were discovered in 1812, and a recent report has just concluded that they °ßare in grave danger of being destroyed by the unstoppable march of tourism.°® More than four thousand tourists a day tramp through Petra°¶s rocky tombs. They wear away the delicate red sandstone and occasionally scratch their names on the rock. 	However, it is not just Petra that is under threat of destruction. More than 600 million tourists a year now travel the globe, and huge numbers of them want to visit the world°¶s most treasured sites: the Taj Mahal, Stonehenge, the national parks of Kenya, and so on. Many destinations that used to be remote are now part of package tours. Because of the growing global tourist industry, these sites are now being visited by millions of people every year. 	Tourists are flocking to the neighborhood of the Mediterranean, too. Its population of 130 million can increase and amount to 230 million each summer. The once untouched landscape there now consists of mile after mile of hotels. What°¶s more, the United Nations predicted that visitors to the region could number 760 million by 2025. In Spain, France, Italy, and most of Greece, there is very little undeveloped coastline left, and the Mediterranean has become the dirtiest sea in the whole world. 	Not all of the news is depressing, though. Some governments are becoming more aware of the damage of these valuable areas, and are taking action. For example, the Fushan Botanical Garden in Taiwan has been established to protect part of the island°¶s natural environment. Unlike tourist spots, this reservation preserves the area°¶s natural environment by limiting the number of visitors to just six hundred during the weekends. Visitors are also required to apply in advance for a special entry permit. Additionally, visitors are kept out of certain sections of the park so that the animals and plants there remain undisturbed. Moreover, an education center has been built to teach visitors to have greater respect for the natural environment. These measures have raised the number of plants and animals in and around the reservation. 	There was no doubt that travel opens people°¶s eyes, but how can this possibly be true if the explosive growth of tourism eventually leaves nothing but ruins for visitors to see? If uncontrolled, tourism will continue to take its toll on cultural and natural treasures, and these precious things cannot be restored once they have been spoiled. To prevent further destruction, it is important that governments lay down clear guiding principles to encourage more public participation in environmental conservation. Tourists, too, must act with a stronger sense of responsibility and morality than they do now. After all, visiting these unique and amazing places around the world is a privilege, rather than something that is taken for granted. °XAdapted from °ßDeath by Tourism°XDoes Tourism Ruin Everything That It Touches?°®
