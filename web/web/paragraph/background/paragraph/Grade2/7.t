Lesson Three  The All-important Pumpkin. °@°@For Americans, the simple pumpkin1 has come to symbolize everything that is important and meaningful1 about autumn. Everyone knows it°¶s autumn when pumpkins begin to appear at roadside stands. Soon afterward2, pumpkins will decorate doorsteps2 at Halloween3. Then they°¶ll be part of Thanksgiving4 holiday decorations. They°¶ll also be baked3 into breads and pies. Farmers will know winter is near when morning frost4 is on the pumpkin. °@°@Pumpkin and squash5 are believed to be the first food plants cultivated5 by the Native6 Americans. They cooked pumpkins in stews7 and fed uncooked pieces to their horses. They planted pumpkins among their corn. They also taught the settlers how to plant and eat them. Very quickly the pumpkin became a favorite and an important garden vegetable. It was a healthy addition to the settlers°¶ diet because it was rich in vitamins8 and minerals9. °@°@Of all the uses of pumpkins, none is as amusing10 as the way it was used by the eighteenth-century New Englanders6, or °ßYankees7.°® Yankee men used the pumpkin shell as a guide11 for cutting their hair! They put the pumpkin on their head and trimmed12 around its base. This gave rise to the expression13 °ßpumpkinhead,°® which at first meant New Englander, and later meant someone who looked silly or stupid. °@°@ °@°@Every autumn there are pumpkin festivals held all over the United States. They are a type of harvest14 celebration. Pumpkin queens and kings are named. Prizes15 are given for the biggest or the best-decorated pumpkin, or the best-tasting pumpkin pie. With the help of fertilizers16, some pumpkins have been grown to the size of a small car. °@°@ °@°@Pumpkins are popular with children, not so much for eating as for making jack-o°¶-lanterns8 at Halloween. This custom originated17 over 2,000 years ago with the Celts9, who lived in what is now France and the British Isles10. They celebrated a harvest festival on October 31. It was a joyous18 occasion19, but in some ways also a sad one. It marked the beginning of the long, dark, cold winter. The Celts believed that in the darkness, the spirits20 of the dead walked upon the earth. Therefore. great fires were built on the hills to protect the people from bad spirits. People hollowed21 out turnips11, and put candles inside them. They carried them if they went outside to protect themselves from evil22 spirits. When the settlers came to America, they brought this custom with them. They didn°¶t have turnips, so they used pumpkins instead. °@°@ °@°@Today, of course, children look forward to Halloween and the carving23 of pumpkins. First, the pumpkin is cut open at the top and hollowed out by taking the seeds and pulp12 out. Then, funny or scary24 faces are carved into the side. In the evening, a candle is put inside and the face glows25 in the dark. Sometimes pumpkins are painted and decorated. As Halloween approaches, jack-o°¶-lanterns pop up on doorsteps everywhere.  °@°@ °@°@After Halloween, Americans look forward to the Thanksgiving holiday. Pumpkins and corn are often used as decorations during this time. They symbolize autumn and the spirit of the season. It is a time of giving thanks for the harvest, for the family, and for all the good things that families enjoy. °@°@ °@°@But pumpkins don°¶t only serve as symbols. They°¶re eaten too. Pumpkins are boiled, broiled26, and baked. They°¶re put in bread, cakes, pies, ice cream, cookies, soups, and even hamburgers! Sometimes there seems to be no end to the uses of pumpkins. Who would ever have thought this simple plant would get to be so popular? 
The 90-10 Secret. °@°@The 90-10 secret is incredible! However, very few know and apply this secret. The result? Millions of people are suffering undeserved1 stress, trials2, problems, and heartache3. They never seem to be successful or to enjoy life. °@°@ °@°@Bad days follow bad days. Terrible things seem to be constantly4 happening. Stress, lack of joy, and broken relationships are like a smothering5 blanket. Worry consumes time, anger6 breaks friendships, and life seems dreary and is not enjoyed to the fullest. °@°@ °@°@Does this describe you? If so, do not be discouraged. You can be different. Understand and apply the 90-10 secret. It will change your life! This is the secret: °@°@ °@°@10 percent of life is made up of what happens to you. 90 percent of life is decided by how you react to the other 10 percent. °@°@ °@°@Let me explain. We really have no control over 10 percent of what happens to us. We cannot stop the car from breaking down. The plane may be late arriving, which throws our whole schedule off. A driver may cut us off in traffic. You get the picture. We have no control over this 10 percent. °@°@ °@°@The other 90 percent is different. You determine the other 90 percent! How? By your reactions. You cannot control a red light, but you can control your reaction to it. Don°¶t let people fool you; you can control how you react! Look at the following example. °@°@ °@°@You°¶re eating breakfast with your family. Your daughter knocks over a cup of coffee and it spills7 onto your business shirt. You have no control over what just happened. What happens next will be determined by how you react. °@°@ °@°@You curse8. You harshly scold9 your daughter for knocking the coffee cup over. She breaks down in tears. After scolding her, you turn to your spouse10 and criticize him or her for placing the cup too close to the edge11 of the table. A short verbal12 battle follows. You storm13 upstairs and change your shirt. °@°@ °@°@Back downstairs you find your daughter has been too busy crying to finish breakfast and get ready for school. She misses the bus. Your spouse must leave immediately to run an errand14. You rush to the car and drive your daughter to school. °@°@ °@°@Because you are late, you drive 40 mph on a 30 mph street. A police officer stops you, and after a fifteen-minute delay15 and throwing sixty dollars away on a speeding16 ticket, you arrive at the school. Your daughter runs to the building without saying goodbye. After arriving at the office twenty minutes late, you find that you forgot your briefcase17. °@°@ °@°@Your day has gotten off to a terrible start. As it continues, it seems to get worse and worse. You look forward to going home. When you arrive home, you find a small wedge1 in your relationship with your spouse and your daughter. This caps off a terrible day. °@°@ °@°@Why did you have a bad day? ______ °@°@A) The coffee caused it. °@°@B) Your daughter caused it. °@°@C) The police officer caused it. °@°@D) You caused it. °@°@The answer is D. You had no control over what happened with the coffee. How you reacted in those five seconds is what caused your bad day. Here is what could have, and should have, happened. °@°@ °@°@Coffee splashes18 over you. Your daughter is about to cry. You gently say, °ßIt°¶s OK, honey2, you just need to be more careful next time.°® Grabbing a towel, you rush upstairs. After slipping on a new shirt and picking up your briefcase, you come back down in time to look through the window and see your daughter getting on the bus. She turns and waves. °@°@ °@°@You and your spouse kiss before you both go to work. You arrive five minutes early and cheerfully19 greet the staff20. Your boss comments on how well your day is going. °@°@ °@°@Notice the difference? We have two totally different scenarios3. Both started the same way, but they ended differently. Why? Because of how you reacted. °@°@ °@°@You now know the 90-10 secret. Use it and take control of your life. Don°¶t focus21 on the 10 percent you can°¶t change. Focus on the 90 percent you can change. °@°@ 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄGeneral Douglas MacArthur* is an American war hero. He was born in 1 into a family with a long tradition of serving in the military. MacArthur went to the U.S. Military Academy* at West Point, where he graduated with distinction. On his first assignment, he was sent to Asia to serve in the Philippines* and Japan. Later he also served in Central America and Europe. In 1, MacArthur was made commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East*. And that is where he performed his most remarkable feats*.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhile battling in the Pacific*, MacArthur wrote this prayer. It was for his only child, Arthur MacArthur IV*, who had been named after Douglas MacArthur‚Äôs grandfather, another outstanding general. Even though Arthur didn‚Äôt follow in his father‚Äôs footsteps and studied art instead, this prayer remains as a significant piece of writing. It uses beautiful language and shows a great man‚Äôs high expectations of his son. As a matter of fact, this prayer is not just a letter that is addressed to God but a message to all the youth.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄBuild me a son, O Lord*, who will be strong enough to know when he is weak, and brave enough to face himself when he is afraid; one who will be proud and unbending* in honest defeat, and humble and gentle in victory.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄBuild me a son whose wishbone* will not be where his backbone* should be; a son who will know Thee* ‚Äîand that to know himself is the foundation stone of knowledge.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄLead him, I pray, not in the path of ease and comfort, but under the stress and spur* of difficulties and challenges. Here let him learn to stand up in the storm; here let him learn compassion for those who fail.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄBuild me a son whose heart will be clear, whose goal will be high; a son who will master himself before he seeks to master other men; one who will learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep; one who will reach into the future, yet never forget the past.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd after all these things are his, add, I pray, enough of a sense of humor, so that he may always be serious, yet never take himself too seriously. Give him humility, so that he may always remember the simplicity of true greatness, the open mind of true wisdom, the meekness* of true strength. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThen, I, his father, will dare to whisper, ‚ÄúI have not lived in vain!‚Äù 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄSuppose you were enrolled at a foreign university, and one night you dreamed that you were floating above a table in a spacious room, moving further and further away from it. All of a sudden, you were sitting at the table with many people, all of whom were strangers. The table was covered with books instead of plates, but you couldn‚Äôt open any of them when you tried to. No sooner had this happened than, out of nowhere, a dog came running in and started barking. Suddenly, you saw that it was not a dog but your father and that the guests were your friends and family members, who were laughing. How would you look at this complicated, seemingly self-contradictory* dream? According to Sigmund Freud*, dreams are more than a collection of meaningless or ridiculous events or images; they may in fact represent emotions and desires deep in your mind. „ÄÄ„ÄÄFreud was a renowned psychiatrist* in Vienna*, Austria*, in the early 2th century. He treated patients with psychological problems by simply letting them talk to him about anything that was bothering them. In this way, he began to realize that many patients had forgotten certain, perhaps painful, events which could still affect their feelings and actions. Freud thought these ‚Äúrepressed‚Äù memories or thoughts were hidden in the unconscious mind. They were altered or disguised when they appeared in our actual dreams at night so that we could continue to sleep without being disturbed. Otherwise, when confronted by these memories or thoughts, we would become distressed and soon wake up. Thus, dreams fundamentally act as the guardians of sleep. Freud set forth this theory of dreams in his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams, which was first published in 1. „ÄÄ„ÄÄHow are our memories and ideas actually transformed in our dreams? Freud, in his book, mentions a few very important mechanisms. One of them is condensation*, by which two or more unrelated, or even contradictory, dream-thoughts* are combined to form one single element. Take the dream in the first paragraph for example. The scene of yourself floating above the table may be a combination, or condensation, of your anxiety about going far away from home and your sense of new-found freedom and power. The two different scenes of sitting at the table could be explained as a condensation of opposite feelings about your friends and family: they might become strangers to you when you go away, but on the other hand they will still be very close to you. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAnother mechanism is displacement*, in which a troubling thought is replaced by a symbol. This removes the emotional significance of the thought so that the dreamer does not become suspicious. For example, the barking dog in the above-mentioned dream may actually be your father. The most obvious meaning is that you worry how angry your father will be if you do not succeed in your studies. In addition, the food that we would normally expect to be on a dining table was displaced by books. This perhaps suggests that the latter are almost as important as food to the dreamer. „ÄÄ„ÄÄDoes Freud‚Äôs theory of dream interpretation make sense to you? Perhaps you may try to take a closer look at some of your dreams in order to attain a deeper understanding of yourself and your hidden or ‚Äúunconscious‚Äù feelings. As the poet Pope* said, ‚ÄúThe proper study of mankind is man,‚Äù but perhaps man is also his own greatest mystery. 
Sleep.      Scientists have learned a great deal in the last thirty years by studying people as they sleep. They study the bodily characteristics that change during sleep. They have learned that there is one kind of sleep which causes rapid eye movement (REM) and another kind with no rapid eye movement (NREM).       Sleep is divided into three stages. In stage one, when you start to go to sleep, you have a pleasant floating feeling. In stage two you sleep more deeply, and a noise will probably not wake you. In stage three, the brain waves are less active. This third stage is when you dream, and REM tends to signal that we are dreaming. For the rest of the night, you alternate between REM and NREM sleep.       Sleep is a biological need, but your brain never really sleeps. The things that were on your mind during the day are still there at night. They appear as dreams. Researchers say that normal people may have four or five REM periods of dreaming each night. The first one may begin only a half hour after they fall asleep, and the final one may last up to an hour. Nightmares usually occur toward dawn.      Besides dreaming, snoring is also common in one°¶s sleep. There are lots of jokes about snoring, but it isn°¶t really funny. People snore because they have trouble breathing while they are asleep. Some snorers have a condition called apnea. They stop breathing up to thirty or forty times an hour because the throat muscles relax too much and block the airway. After a period of time, the brain will signal the person to start breathing again. This pattern is often accompanied by snoring. This is a dangerous condition, because once the brain is without oxygen for four minutes there will be permanent brain damage. Sleep apnea can also cause irregular heartbeats, high blood pressure, and a general lack of energy.      Most people need from seven and a half to eight and a half hours of sleep a night, but this varies with each individual. Babies sleep eighteen hours, and older people need less sleep than younger people. If someone continually sleeps longer than normal for no apparent reason, there may be something physically or psychologically wrong.      What should you do if you have trouble sleeping? Lots of people take sleeping pills, but these are dangerous because they can be addictive. If you take them for several weeks, it is hard to stop taking them. Doctors say the best thing is to try to relax and to avoid bad habits. Caffeine keeps people awake, so don°¶t drink anything with caffeine in the evening.       Sleep is important to humans. In an average lifetime, 220,000 hours are spent sleeping, so we need to understand everything we can about sleep.

Love Matters. °@°@As for the romantic love between a man and a woman, some people say such love is cruel, while others say it is sweet. Still others consider love to be blind. One thing is for sure: love is mysterious and paradoxical, and the definition of it may vary from person to person. In fact, people°¶s feelings about love depend on whether they are in search of love, deeply in love, or suffering from the loss of love. Thus it is not easy to define the abstract idea of °ßlove,°® especially romantic love.  °@°@Love is frequently chosen as a subject of poetry. Maybe we can better understand what love is by reading some works on love. In the following poem entitled °ßGlove,°® a romantic couple is skillfully compared to a hand and a glove: °@°@Glove       Bruce Guernsey (1944-) If in this word is love itself then love is bone and blood inside the form that warms your lovely hand°X your hand is love and mine that takes your love in mine without your hand is nothing but an empty word. The metaphor here is that of a person holding his or her lover°¶s hand like a glove holds a hand. The glove or hand would be empty without the hand °ßinside°® of it. Thus we have the sense that one°¶s life would be incomplete or even completely meaningless if he or she were no longer loved.      °ßA White Rose°® shows us more about the essence of love itself: A White Rose John Boyle O'Reilly?(1844°V1890) The red rose whispers of passion, And the white rose breathes of love; Oh, the red rose is a falcon, And the white rose is a dove. But I send you a cream-white rosebud With a flush on its petal tips; For the love that is purest and sweetest Has a kiss of desire on the lips.      Roses often represent love in poetry, and in this poem the red rose of passion is compared to a falcon, an aggressive and even violent bird. On the other hand, the white rose of love is compared to the dove, which symbolizes peace. The poet O°¶Reilly finally sends to his lover a rose that combines both meanings, perhaps the most complete kind of love.      Though these two poets present different images of love through metaphorical language, readers can easily feel the truth in their descriptions of love. After all, the basic elements of romantic love are obvious to all, no matter how different the definitions of love may be. Love may be hard to define, but we have all experienced it in one way or another. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnimal World is a talk show that discusses2 topics3 related to animals. What do today‚Äôs speakers think about animal rights? 	Host:	Welcome to Animal World. Today‚Äôs program is about animal rights. Now, most of our viewers4 probably have already made up their minds about animal rights, but we have two guests5 here today to challenge our perspectives6. Let‚Äôs start with Dr. Faye1. Dr. Faye, would you please introduce yourself and tell us what you do? 	Dr. Faye:	Sure, I‚Äôm a medical7 researcher at 2Pharmco Labs8. I do experiments9 on animals to find cures10 for human diseases. 	Mr. Bates:	I‚Äôm Charlie Bates3. And I‚Äôm here as the president of FOA4, Friends of Animals. I promote11 animal rights. 	Host:	Let‚Äôs start there, Mr. Bates, what do you mean by animal rights? 	Mr. Bates:	For me, it means that animals deserve12 to live according to their natures, free13 from harm, abuse14, and exploitation15. Humans have rights, and so do animals.  	Dr. Faye:	Oh, that‚Äôs ridiculou1s6. Animals have no rights. Humans have always used animals in their daily17 lives.  	Host:	Okay, now it is obvious that you two don‚Äôt agree. 	Dr. Faye:	That‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs obvious that FOA thinks animals have rights, but they don‚Äôt. Animals are animals. That‚Äôs it. How can animals have rights? 	Host:	Well, Dr. Faye, aren‚Äôt humans animals? 	Dr. Faye:	Well, humans and animals are similar18 in some ways. All need to breathe, to eat, and to sleep. But we have nothing else in common with them. 	Mr. Bates:	Oh, come on. Give me a break. We have a lot in common with other animals. We need to give animals the same respect that we give to each other. 	Dr. Faye:	But Mr. Bates, surely19 you recognize that there are important differences. Humans are superior20 to other animals. 	Mr. Bates:	No, no, no, no, no. That is so wrong! 	Dr. Faye:	Let me....  	Mr. Bates:	To think that we‚Äôre better than animals.... No. No way. 	Dr. Faye:	Look, let me finish, Mr. Bates. We have languages, right? We have civilizations21.... 	Mr. Bates:	Yeah. 	Dr. Faye:	We have art. Because of those differences, I feel that humans can use other animals. We can use them for food and clothing5; we can use them for medical research to help humans live better and longer. 	Mr. Bates:	You‚Äôre right that we have additional22 abilities that animals don‚Äôt have, but that‚Äôs exactly why we should protect23 them. We don‚Äôt need to hunt24 them and eat them, or to capture25 them and put them in zoos. We don‚Äôt need to hurt them at all. We can develop substitutes26 for everything that we now use animals for. 	Dr. Faye:	Animals aren‚Äôt worth27 all that trouble. I believe humans need to  use other animals for food, clothing, and medical research. In my opinion28, we can use other animals for anything we want. 	Host:	Well, we‚Äôll have to cut this off now, but we will continue the discussion after the break. 
Unit10  Anne Frank°¶s Diary. 	In the years leading up to World War II, and also throughout the war, the Nazi government of Germany adopted a racist policy that led to the murder of millions of Jews, known as the Holocaust. In Germany and in the countries occupied by the German army, Jews were made to wear a yellow star so that they could be easily identified. They were also rounded up and sent to concentration camps, where they were shot, gassed, or left to die of starvation or disease. The only chance of survival was to hide, so Anne Frank and her family lived in hiding for two years in a place called the Secret Annex. During that period, she kept a diary.                                              Wednesday, January 13, 1943 Dearest Kitty, 	This morning I was constantly interrupted. As a result, I haven°¶t been able to finish a single thing I°¶ve begun. 	We have a new recreation, namely, filling packages with powdered gravy. The gravy is one of Gies & Co.°¶s products. Mr. Kugler hasn°¶t been able to find anyone else to do the job. Besides, our wages are lower. It°¶s the kind of work they do in prisons. It°¶s incredibly boring and makes us dizzy and giggly. 	Terrible things are happening outside. At any time of night and day, poor, helpless people are being dragged out of their homes. They°¶re allowed to take only a rucksack and a little cash with them, and even then, they°¶re robbed of their possessions on the way. Families are torn apart; men, women, and children are separated. Children come home from school to find that their parents have disappeared. Women return from shopping to find their houses sealed and their families gone. The Christians in Holland are also living in fear because their sons are being sent to Germany. Everyone is scared. Every night, hundreds of planes pass over Holland on their way to German cities, to sow their bombs on German soil. Every hour, hundreds°Xor maybe even thousands°Xof people are being killed in Russia and Africa. No one can keep out of the conflict; the entire world is at war. Even though the Allies are doing better, the end is nowhere in sight. 	As for us, we°¶re quite fortunate°Xluckier than millions of people. It°¶s quiet and safe here, and we°¶re using our money to buy food. We°¶re so selfish that we talk about °ßafter the war°® and look forward to new clothes and shoes, when actually we should lay aside every penny to help others when the war is over and save whatever we can. 	The children in this neighborhood run around in thin shirts and wooden clogs. They have no coats, no socks, no caps, and no one to help them. Gnawing on a carrot to ease their hunger pain, they walk from their cold houses through cold streets to an even colder classroom. Things have gotten so bad in Holland that crowds of children stop passers-by in the streets to beg for a piece of bread. 	I could spend hours telling you about the suffering the war has caused, but I°¶d only make myself more miserable. All we can do is wait, as calmly as possible, for it to end. Jews and Christians alike are waiting; the whole world is waiting, and many are waiting for death. Yours, Anne 	Anne Frank°¶s story did not have a happy ending. After two years of hiding, Anne and her family were betrayed to the Nazi authorities. They were all captured by the Gestapo and then sent to different concentration camps. Otto Frank, Anne°¶s father, was the sole survivor of the Holocaust in the Frank family. Fortunately, Anne°¶s diary had been kept safe during the war. After Otto Frank read his daughter°¶s diary, he decided to have it published so that other people could read not only about the horrors of war but also about the love, family, and friendship that had given Anne hope. Today, millions of people have read Anne Frank°¶s diary, and the Secret Annex has become a museum in memory of the people who suffered so many hardships and those who died in the Holocaust. °XInterpreted by Vanessa York.

Unit 9 A Glimpse into the future. 	Fifty years ago, most people lived their lives without color TV sets, cell phones, personal computers, and digital cameras. Little did they know that these appliances and electronic devices would someday come into being, not to mention the fact that they would become so important in modern life. Today, however, thanks to the huge amount of progress made as a result of technological developments, we are allowed a glimpse into the near future. 	Computers have come a long way since the latter half of the 20th century and have had a great influence on us. Interestingly, sci-fi movies sometimes give us clues about what computers in the future will be like. In Iron Man, Jarvis, the mainframe in Tony Stark°¶s home laboratory, is equipped with a user interface to verbally and visually interact with Stark. Jarvis seems to be more advanced than all the other computers that we can ever imagine. Now, we are already reaping the benefits of the touch screen, though a mouse and keyboard is still used to input most instructions to a computer. Yet, with the steady progress in computer technology, we don°¶t need to type in commands to operate our computers, nor do we need to press mouse buttons to copy, delete, or highlight certain information. Perhaps in another decade, we will simply speak to or gesture at a computer and then receive immediate responses from it°Xjust like what we°¶ve seen in Iron Man. 	The hologram is another cutting-edge special effect in sci-fi movies that blows us away. In Avatar, Jake Sully sat in his wheelchair, observing the °ßHome Tree of Pandora°® presented by this technology. Researchers have developed holography to display three-dimensional images that can be viewed from 360 degrees. Currently, we can see holograms on some stickers and CD or DVD covers. In the future, those who take driving lessons can practice driving with images of heavy traffic from a projector surrounding them, and they will learn how to deal with turns and corners in virtual reality. In history or art class, the classroom will be turned into a museum whenever teachers need examples of the Bronze Age or Dadaism. Even when we feel like going swimming, we can go scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef right in our houses. All in all, futuristic devices prepare us for a better tomorrow. Nevertheless, the fact that energy resources are running out is a worrisome problem. It is vital that we conserve energy resources and meanwhile explore alternative ones that are not harmful to the environment. Here°¶s one green and attractive idea: miniature power plants. With solar panels on the roof of a house, the sun°¶s rays can be easily converted to electricity. With small wind turbines on our balconies, we can use the power of the wind to generate electricity as well. Only when the sun is not shining or the wind not blowing will we have to pay a power company for electricity. In fact, the idea of miniature power plants has been developed and put into action in some countries. If it is carried out worldwide, we will become self-sufficient in energy. Moreover, we can sell any surplus electricity and earn an extra profit. 	In the dynamic world where we live, the only constant thing is change. We don°¶t know exactly what the future will bring us, but we can be sure that people will continue to come up with bright ideas for improving the way we live. In the future, the devices our grandchildren use will probably be much better than all the technology we have today°Xeven better than the ones mentioned above. °XBy Paul Geraghty
