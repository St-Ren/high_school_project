Unit 2 The Man Who Took Starbucks to the World.     ¡§The Great Good Place¡¨ is a short story by American novelist Henry James, first published in 1900. Its theme1 is that people need a place where they can escape the grind1 of daily life. This was an idea that Howard Schultz2, the man who turned the Starbucks coffee chain into an international giant2, used in his business strategy3.      Born in 1952, Schultz grew up in Brooklyn3, New York. After university, he went to work for a firm that supplied coffee-making equipment4. Not long after he began working there, Schultz noticed that a company in Seattle4 was buying a surprisingly large amount of the firm¡¦s equipment, and he decided to investigate5. It turned out to be a simple coffee-bean store, but its owners were dedicated6 to teaching the public to appreciate7 good coffee.       This store in Seattle had opened in 1971 and taken its name from Starbuck, a sailor in the classic8 novel Moby-Dick5. Its logo9 was a two-tailed mermaid. Fascinated by its owners¡¦ dedication to coffee, Schultz joined Starbucks. Later, on a trip to Europe, he was impressed10 by the way that street caf?s in Italy were both meeting points and places to drink espresso6. This was something America didn¡¦t have yet.       In 1985 Schultz set up his own coffee-bar business, which soon became a success. Two years later, he got together with some other investors and bought Starbucks for US$3.8 million. Adopting11 the name and logo, Schultz developed a marketing strategy that turned ordinary caf?s into fashionable outlets7 for coffee. He used clever gimmicks12, such as selling coffee in ¡§short,¡¨ ¡§tall,¡¨ and ¡§grande8¡¨ sizes rather than the usual small, medium, and large. Customers learned to pronounce13 unfamiliar Italian names like latte9 and macchiato10. Schultz actually created a market that hadn¡¦t existed14 before.       Within twenty years, Schultz had taken coffee culture from the streets of Europe to just about every city in the developed world. Today, tens of millions of people a week visit Starbucks locations in countries all over the globe. Clearly, these customers15 are happy with the ¡§great good place¡¨ that Howard Schultz has built.  
Lesson 1 Mona Lisa and Da Vinci. ¡@¡@You have certainly seen the Mona Lisa1 before. A woman with a slight smile on her face, her hands crossed over her stomach, sits in front of a strange and beautiful landscape1 looking straight2 at you. This little painting on wood3, by Leonardo da Vinci2, is the most famous piece of art in the world. One reason for this is its great mystery. No one knows for sure who Mona Lisa really was. Da Vinci kept a diary4 of all his other portrait5 sittings3, but he never wrote down who posed6 for the Mona Lisa. Some people believe that a Florentine4 lady whom da Vinci knew was the model7, but there is no definite8 proof9 of this. Some people believe that the model was a young boy dressed as a woman. But perhaps the most interesting theory is that the painting is a self-portrait. Some people say that there is a strong resemblance10 between the eyes, nose, and mouth of Leonardo da Vinci¡¦s self-portraits and the Mona Lisa¡¦s face. ¡@¡@Da Vinci himself lived a very mysterious life. There are many legends11 about him, some of which are very different from the others. In some descriptions he is an athlete, but other people thought of him as a quiet dreamer. However, he did keep very detailed12 notebooks describing his many insights13 and inventions14. Da Vinci wrote his notebooks backwards, so that they can only be read in a mirror. From these amazing diaries we know that he was a genius15 at many things. He was mainly known during his life as an engineer, and in fact his notebooks are full of brilliant16 inventions¡Xweapons17, bridges, buildings, ways to move water, flying machines, and many other things that no one had ever thought of or built before. He also drew human beings perfectly, and studied the science of animals and plants. But it is not just because the artist was so interesting that the Mona Lisa in particular has become the symbol of fine art throughout the world. ¡@¡@Why is the Mona Lisa so exciting and captivating18? What is it about this picture that makes it impossible to look away? The face of a human being is the most expressive19 and enchanting20 thing we can look at. Looking at other people, we can recognize all of our own feelings and thoughts in their eyes and the shapes of their mouths. When we look into another¡¦s eyes, we understand and feel much more than when we look at fruit or flowers. And the Mona Lisa is even more alive21 than many other paintings of the human face. The Mona Lisa is painted in a very special way, so that looking at her is just like looking at a real person. This is not because she is painted perfectly realistically22, like a photograph23¡Xshe¡¦s not. The corners24 of her eyes and mouth, all of the lines and colors in her skin, are soft and blurred25. This makes her seem to be moving, like a person who is breathing26 and whose heart is beating27. Every time you look at the Mona Lisa, she seems to have changed a little. Every person who looks at her sees something different. Some people see sadness in her smile, others see mischief28, and some people think she is laughing at them. But looking at Mona Lisa¡¦s mysterious smile, many people feel that she knows a secret, and she intends29 to keep it forever. 
Should a Killer Live? Two Points of View. Life in Prison Is Still Life: Why Should a Killer Live? ¡@¡@Murder1 is totally2 unfair; the victims of murder are gone forever. Their hopes and plans have ended permanently3, and the pleasures they enjoyed in life have been destroyed. They will never see their friends again and will never hear the voices of their parents, brothers, and sisters, who cry, ¡§How could this have happened?¡¨ But the murderer is still alive. Without capital4 punishment, murderers are allowed to participate5 in and enjoy life. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Today there are murderers in prisons all over the world. Most of them would rather spend their lives in prison than die. This is not surprising since the desire6 to live is normal7 and natural. In prison there are many small pleasures that one can enjoy every day: the feeling of warm sunshine8, the taste of a hot meal, the comfort of sleep. The lifestyle9 in prison is not always harsh10 and cruel11; many prisoners have the opportunity to continue their education12, to play sports, to enjoy movies, and to receive visits from their loved ones. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@There is no reason why a killer, a destroyer of life, should live. Justice requires that each person respect the rights and freedoms of every other person, or be punished for not doing so. The people who commit13 murder give up their rights to citizenship14 and to life itself. Why should the taxes15 paid by citizens¡Xincluding the victim¡¦s family¡Xkeep a killer alive? The only fair punishment is execution16. Execution puts the killer away from society forever, stops him from killing again, and sends a strong message to others who might kill: killers will not be allowed to live. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Let sunshine fall on those who respect life¡Xnot on those who destroy it. Why Do We Kill People to Show That Killing People Is Wrong? ¡@¡@There are times when murder is committed not because of cruelty. People may kill for other reasons, such as out of anger, misunderstanding17, or fear. Everyone has made mistakes because of such feelings. For society, it is a serious mistake to take the life of someone who has killed because it teaches everyone that forgiveness18 is unnecessary. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@The government has the difficult job of deciding who is guilty19, and this job can never be done perfectly. If capital punishment is allowed, there always exists20 the possibility21 that an innocent22 person will be executed by mistake. When that happens, an even worse crime has been committed¡Xthe killing of an innocent person by the government. In the United States, it is a fact that the poor and minorities23 get the death penalty24 more often than white people do. Furthermore25, the idea that capital punishment stops criminals from committing murder is doubtful26; studies have been unable to show that the fear of capital punishment stops someone from committing murder any more than other punishments. And let us not forget that murdering the murderer is a violent27 act in itself; it is revenge. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@We cannot imagine the pain of family members who have been waiting for years for the government¡¦s decision to execute or not execute their loved one. It also costs taxpayers millions of dollars more to execute a criminal than to imprison28 that criminal for life. Prison is a better form of punishment because it protects society and punishes criminals by taking away their freedom. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@People can change, even people who have made terrible mistakes. Life in prison gives people the chance to change. Caryl Chessman1 is an example of someone who became a better person in prison. He taught other prisoners how to read, and he wrote several books. Before his execution, he wrote that he had finally learned not to hate. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Chessman learned this important lesson in prison. But a dead man learns nothing, and an executed person will never change. When a government kills, it is murdering hope. 
Going to Extremes. ¡@¡@Many people love sports, but some love intense1 and dangerous sports. They want to push their bodies and their minds to the limit2. They want to challenge nature. We could say that these people love to go to extremes¡Xand that¡¦s why we call the sports they enjoy extreme sports. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Extreme sports have been around for many years. Daring people have always loved to take part in such activities as surfing1, rock climbing2, hang gliding3, car racing, and skydiving4. But in the past ten to fifteen years, extreme sports have taken off in many new directions. Nowadays, you can find more and more people doing things like ski jumping5, ice climbing6, cliff diving7, and even wingsuit diving8, in which people jump from an airplane wearing a special ¡§birdman¡¨ suit that allows them to fly through the sky before they parachute3 to the ground. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@The most popular extreme sports are those seen at the annual X Games, sponsored4 by ESPN9, or on the Extreme Sports Channel, which broadcasts5 to more than sixty countries and in twelve languages. There you can find skateboarders10 turning and spinning off of huge ramps6, bikers racing downhill7 at top speed, or motocross11 racers flying on motorcycles into the air and doing double and triple8 flips9. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@These may seem like very diverse10 sports, but they do have things in common. All of them offer a feeling that we would describe as exhilarating11, meaning that they are physically very exciting and thrilling. All of them require special skills and a high level of physical fitness12. And, compared to the usual sports, all of them have a higher element13 of danger and risk. Accidents, injuries, and even death do occur. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@So what kind of person is willing to take such risks? Surprisingly, according to one study, people who take part in extreme sports actually see themselves as cautious. They are often disciplined and sometimes train for many years before they are good at their sport. Their reward for such hard work is not only the thrill or the sense of accomplishment, but also, they say, a feeling of freedom and awareness found only in the challenges offered by extreme sports. ¡@¡@ 
ï»¿ããKyoto, like a beauty in a kimono* full of bright colors, delights tourists throughout the year. In spring, pink cherry blossoms* create a romantic atmosphere. Emerald* leaves rustle* in the summer breeze, scattering sunshine on the narrow alleys. Maple leaves in autumn blaze* with the colors of orange and red. When winter comes, white snow turns the whole city into a silver world.  ããKyoto is the spiritual heart of Japan. It was the nationâs capital for more than 1, years, leaving behind a large number of historic shrines and temples. One of the most photographed temples is the Golden Pavilion Temple*. This pavilion is covered in gold leaf and shines as brightly as the sun. It casts a postcard reflection on the Japanese garden pond in front of it. Those who seek Zen* simplicity should visit Ryoanji Temple* to see the most famous Zen rock garden in Japan. Zen rock gardens use rocks and sand to suggest mountains and water. They are designed to imitate nature within a limited space. The skillful arrangement of the rocks and the sand is meant to imitate rippling* water, and to provide the viewer with a tranquil* sense of natural beauty.  ããA visit to a temple or shrine can never be complete without getting yourself an omamori* at a gift shop. An omamori is a good-luck charm in the form of a small cloth packet. In it are prayers written on a piece of paper or wood. It is believed to bring love, protection, good health, good luck, or success either in school or in business. The Japanese also believe they should not open an omamori. Once it is opened, the omamori will lose its magic power.  ããThe Gion District* is another popular tourist attraction. The mysterious charm of the Gion District hides in the teahouses, where geishas* in colorful kimonos have been performing their traditional arts for hundreds of years. Geishas have to spend up to five years learning the traditional tea ceremony, musical instruments, songs, and literature. They also have to learn how to perform the traditional kyomai* dance. Its dance movements are very controlled yet show very strong emotions. If visitors to this district are lucky enough, they can catch sight of geishas on their way to or from work.  ããIn Kyoto, the past and the present flow together like the graceful movements of kyomai. Tourists like to come to Kyoto to view autumnâs maple leaves or springâs cherry blossoms. However, Kyotoâs temples, geishas, and traditional arts can capture their hearts in any season of the year. 
ï»¿ When you wish upon a star Makes no difference who you are Anything your heart desires Will come to you If your heart is in your dreams No request is too extreme When you wish upon a star As dreamers do Fate is kind She brings to those who love The sweet fulfillment of Their secret longing* Like a bolt out of the blue Fate steps in and sees you through When you wish upon a star Your dream comes true     âWhen You Wish upon a Starâ is a popular song that was introduced in the 1 Disney movie Pinocchio*. It has been used in Disney Picturesâ opening logos and in many parades at Disney theme parks. The iconic* first seven notes of the songâs melody are familiar to kids and adults alike. The song conveys an important lesson that the little wooden boy, Pinocchio, learned from life. âIf your heart is in your dreams, no request is too extreme.â Having true love for his father, Pinocchio plucked up the courage to save him from the whale. His prayer was finally answered as his faith and bravery qualified him to become a real boy.  ããThese lyrics are, in a sense, also autobiographical. They tell of Disneyâs own positive, cheerful approach to life, and encourage all of us to pursue our dreams. Born into a farmhandâs* family, Walt Disney* didnât have much opportunity to receive a good education. In fact, he only finished one year of high school. Yet a combination of events, along with his personality, turned him into one of the most inspiring men of the twentieth century. At twenty-two, Disney started his cartoon career in a small studio in California. Though working in poverty and hardship, he remained convinced that his hard work would pay off. One day, a flash of inspiration came to Disney. He created a cheerful little mouse, later known as Mickey Mouse*, which rescued his faltering* career and helped him build his entire fantasy kingdom. It is a kingdom which has been weaving dreams for countless people ever since.  ããIn his later animations*, Disney delivered the same simple message to dreamers again and again. He kept encouraging them to spring into action. For example, Aladdin*, a street urchin*, felt trapped in a life of poverty. Poor as he was, he managed to overcome many obstacles in his pursuit of happiness. Likewise*, Mulan* used her wits to save her country and prove herself despite the disadvantages of being a woman, especially in a traditional Eastern culture. As long as one has love and is determined to achieve his or her goal, fate will do its part and work miracles. ããIn his life and work, Disney knew what it meant to wish upon a star. He dared to dream and to make those dreams come trueâfor himself and for millions of imaginative souls around the world. 
The View from the Window.    Two men occupied the same hospital room. One man had to sit up in his bed for an hour a day to drain the fluids from his lungs. His bed was by the window in the room. The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back. His bed was the one by the door. With nothing else to do, the men got to know each other.    They talked for hours on end. They spoke of their wives, families, homes, jobs, and even where they'd last been on vacation.    Every afternoon a nurse would help the man by the window sit up. This man would pass the whole hour by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window. The man in the other bed lived for those one-hour periods.    His roommate told him that the window overlooked a park with a lovely lake. He described the ducks and swans that swam on the lake. He talked about the smiling children who sailed brightly colored toy boats. He told of lovers walking arm in arm amid flowers of every color of the rainbow. A breathtaking view of the city could also be seen in the distance. As the man by the window described all this in exquisite detail, the man on the other side of the room would imagine the picturesque scenes.    One warm afternoon, the man by the window described a parade passing by. Although the other man couldn't hear the band, he could see it in his mind's eye as the man by the window portrayed it with evocative words.    Unexpectedly, an alien thought entered his head: "Why should he have all the pleasure of seeing everything? I never get to see anything. It isn't fair."    The man felt ashamed at first but as the days passed, his envy grew into resentment. He began to brood and found himself unable to sleep. He should be by that window. This thought began to control his life.    Late one night, the man by the window began to cough. He was choking on the fluid in his lungs. The other man listened as the struggling man tried to reach the button to call for help. The man by the door never pushed his own button, which would have brought the nurse running.    After five minutes, the coughing and choking stopped. There was deathly silence. The following morning, the nurse arrived. She found the lifeless body. She was visibly saddened. The body was taken away. As soon as he found the timing appropriate, the man asked if he could be moved next to the window.     The nurse was happy to make the switch. After making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone. He propped himself up slowly and painfully on one elbow to take his first look.    Finally, he would have the joy of seeing it all himself. He strained to slowly turn and look out of the window beside the bed. He faced a blank wall. 
A Wealth of Health. ¡@¡@Look around, everyone is doing it. Eating vegetables may not be the most popular way to pass the time, but it certainly will give you something in return. No matter who you are, vegetables offer a wealth of health to all who indulge. Asparagus      Eating asparagus was long believed to promote love and compassion. Nowadays, this vegetable for lovers actually has science backing it up! It is known for being a good source of folic acid, an important nutrient. Women who plan to have children should eat a great deal of asparagus, as the nutrients in it help prevent birth defects and heart disease. Generally speaking, asparagus is one of the most nutritionally balanced vegetables in existence, so you should not do without it. Bok Choy       Bok choy is a popular type of cabbage in the Far East. In Korea, it is the main vegetable used to make kimchi. Scientists have found that eating it lowers the risk of developing lung cancer. Like asparagus, it contains folic acid. Moreover it provides another nutrient, called lutein, which protects the eyes, slows cancer growth, and reduces the risk of heart disease. There is also evidence that bok choy can strengthen our bones because it contains calcium and vitamin K. No matter how you cook it, bok choy has a delicate flavor that will complement all kinds of dishes. Mushrooms      Mushrooms are great flavor enhancers for food, and there are over 38,000 kinds of them. Don't be fooled by their cute umbrella shape, though. Mushrooms actually kill certain bacteria and viruses in our bodies. Some mushrooms also contain plant chemicals that stimulate the immune system. The benefits of eating mushrooms include lowering blood pressure and helping the body fight cancer. Eating mushrooms is great for your health! No wonder mushroom hunters around the world go into forests just to find this funny-looking, great-tasting fungus. Chili Peppers      Many people, such as those who live in Thailand and Mexico, cook regularly with a number of chili peppers. Chili peppers can really heat things up-- and not just in your mouth. These peppers contain an active ingredient called capsaicin, which can make the blood move. It contributes to blood circulation, which accelerates the delivery of nutrients throughout our bodies. Improved blood flow also prevents blood clots that can lead to heart attacks or strokes, and it even helps reduce headaches. So, feel free to spice things up-- it's good for you!      When told to eat their vegetables, children often ask the age-old question "Do I have to?" If you want to live a long, healthy life, it is a good idea to say "Yes!" 
ï»¿ããGreek mythology1, a major part of Western heritage2, has had an  extensive3 influence on its culture, art, and literature. Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have found inspiration in Greek mythology,  which centers on many Greek and Roman gods and heroes4. ããOne of the most thrilling5 stories of ancient Greek mythology is that of brave Bellerophon and his winged horse, Pegasus.  ããBellerophon was a young man of great strength and courage. His father,  as it was said, was Poseidon3, god of the sea. His mother was Euronyme4, a mortal6 woman of deep wisdom who had been taught by the goddess Athena5. With two such parents, no wonder Bellerophon seemed more like a god than  a regular human. He was famous throughout Greece6 for his bravery and sense of adventure7, but he was perhaps most famous for the wonderful horse that  he rode. ããFor a long time, Bellerophonâs greatest wish had been to be the master8  of Pegasus, a magical9 winged horse. Pegasus could fly as fast as the wind and never grew tired. Bellerophon tried to dream up ways to catch the great horse, but he could think of none. At last, he asked a famous wise man what to do, and he told Bellerophon to spend the night in the temple10 of Athena. Perhaps the goddesses would come to him in a dream and show him how to charm11 Pegasus.  ããThat night in the temple, beneath the stars, Bellerophon fell into a deep sleep. As he slept, the goddess Athena appeared and gave him a wonderful golden bridle7 unlike any ever made by humans. If Bellerophon could catch Pegasus with this bridle, Athena promised, the horse would be his.  ããWhen he woke up, Bellerophon feared Athenaâs visit was only a dream. But then he saw the shining bridle beside  him and knew the dream was true.  Seizing the bridle, he rushed to the  fields12 in order to catch Pegasus.  ãThe horse stood in the middle13 of the field drinking from a spring, his wings shining in the light of the morning sun. Bellerophon was not sure how  to get the magic bridle onto Pegasus, so he approached the powerful horse  with caution. Much to the young manâs surprise, Pegasus stayed calm and quietly let Bellerophon slip14 the bridle over his head. ããBellerophon was filled with joy as he realized that Athena had made   the great Pegasus his. Quickly, he leaped upon the winged horseâs back, and together they flew to the sky. Flying through the clouds, the two became close friends. ããBellerophon proudly rode the magical stallion8 wherever he wished.     In the years that followed, Pegasus helped him meet many great challenges. Perhaps the most difficult one was killing Chimera9. She was a terribly dangerous fire-breathing10 creature with the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail15 of a serpent11. This fantastic16 monster17 had killed many men who had come to her cave18. She hit with her poisonous19 tail and struck with her  lion claws. Her burning dragonâs breath12 could melt20 a man. No one thought  she could be beaten.  ããThere was an evil21 king who sent Bellerophon to kill Chimera because he was certain Bellerophon would fail and would be killed. But Bellerophon was not afraid. ãAs Bellerophon and Pegasus came closer to Chimeraâs cave on top of a mountain, they could hear the scary22 sound of the monster; they could see the flames23 leaping from her jaws. But they were in no danger, for they flew above her, safely beyond her. ããThen Pegasus came down low over the monster, and Bellerophon shot arrow24 after arrow from his big strong bow25. The animal fell to the ground   and died. Bellerophon and Pegasus flew off without being hurt. The king   was surprised by this success and sent Bellerophon on many other difficult adventures. Each time Bellerophon succeeded with the help of Pegasus. Their amazing acts were talked about throughout the land. ããAfter years of high praise26, Bellerophonâs pride27 grew even greater,    and he began to believe he was as great as the gods. In fact, he thought he should be allowed to live among the gods in their home on Mount Olympus13. Determined28 to reach that wonderful place so much, he turned Pegasus  toward the heavens. Because Pegasus knew the gods would punish such pride, he refused to fly there and threw his master from his back, dropping him to  the earth below.  ããThe gods did punish Bellerophon. From then on, he was forced29 to  wander the land alone without friends. His pride took him to a very sad end.  ããBut the gods rewarded30 Pegasus for being wise and sensible. They brought him to Olympus, where he became the favorite horse of Zeus14, ruler of all the gods. 
 ¡@¡@Just outside a bank in Kuala Lumpur1, a man notices a ringing mobile1 phone on a mailbox. He picks the phone up, goes into the bank, and asks loudly, ¡§Anyone left a phone outside?¡¨  ¡@¡@On the other side of the world, in central2 London, another abandoned3 mobile phone is ringing. Close by, a young man grabs4 the mobile and hurries away.  ¡@¡@In both of these incidents5, the people who had left their phones were local Reader¡¦s Digest3 reporters6. Our correspondents7 in 32 countries left 30 medium-priced mobile phones in public places¢wa total8 of 960 phones. Two reporters worked as a team¢wone left the phone behind in a busy public place, while the other observed the mobile discreetly9 from a distance. We called the phones after a few minutes and waited to see if anyone would answer and return the phone¢wor keep the phones for themselves. ¡@¡@Having tested the world, we were surprised at and fascinated by the result. Slovenia4 may be a young country, but the people of its capital maintain10 old-fashioned11 honesty12. From a nun at a bus stop to a waiter at a coffee shop, its residents13 were almost universally helpful, with only one of our 30 abandoned phones not returned.  ¡@¡@Could the citizens14 of a big city be as honest? The people of Toronto, Canada returned 28 of the 30 phones we left there.  ¡@¡@How about Asia, where traditional values have been emphasized15? Two thirds of the phones were returned. From Mumbai7 to Singapore8, most people said they returned the phones because it was the right thing to do. ¡@¡@But not everyone was so honest. In a busy mall9 in Hong Kong, a security guard16 picked up our phone and then wrapped it in a piece of paper. When approached17 by our reporter, he said, ¡§What phone? I didn¡¦t see any phone. If you¡¦ve lost something, report it to Lost and Found.¡¨ He was one of the six shopping center security guards around the world whom our reporters observed pocketing10 the phones and failing to report them lost. On a positive note, however, every policeman we encountered18 seemed to be honest.  ¡@¡@Wealth was no guarantee of honesty. In New Zealand, a smartly dressed woman grabbed a ¡§lost¡¨ mobile and ran away. In contrast, a poor Brazilian11 woman handed back a mobile phone she picked up in a park.  ¡@¡@All over the world, the most common reason people gave for returning our phones was that they too had once lost an item of value and did not want others to suffer the same experience as they had. Many people were also aware how essential a phone can be because of the personal information stored19 within it. ¡@¡@Many adults accompanied20 by children were keen21 to show the little ones how to behave when they spotted22 our phones. They wanted to set a good example for their children. But not all parents thought so. In Amsterdam12, a boy of about ten begged his parents to let him keep a phone he had found. They seemed to feel some conflict23, but after he had given his mother a smile and a kiss on the cheek, they gave in.  ¡@¡@So, how did the people of Planet Earth perform in our honesty test? Before the experiment, our reporters heard plenty of pessimism24 about getting our phones back. Many people said we would be lucky to see half our phones again. However, altogether25, 654 mobiles were returned to us¢wthat is a happy 68 percent of the abandoned phones.  ¡@¡@A homeless26 man in Budapest13 found a phone and returned it. ¡§You find things and you lose things,¡¨ he said. ¡§But you never lose your honesty.¡¨  	
Unit 2  No Escape from the Web. ¡@¡@Have you ever run into trouble trying to contact a friend you have long lost touch with? In the past, people didn¡¦t have effective solutions to this problem. Asking mutual friends seemed to be the only way to handle this matter, and it often took ages. Today, however, all you need to do is simply go online, upload a picture of your friend, and provide information about his or her background. Soon, you will find this friend. How could this possibly happen? The answer definitely lies in the rapid development of online communities and the crucial role they play in the search process. ¡@¡@Nowadays, many people are deeply involved in online communities, and some have become netizens. They post opinions online, upload and download files, and make online friends. These netizens spend a great deal of time engaging in various online activities in this virtual world. The ¡§footprints¡¨ they have left on the Web thus become clues that allow Internet users to find almost anyone or anything they want. Such ways of searching are known as ¡§human flesh search.¡¨ ¡@¡@An example of this occurred in Taiwan when a man mistreated a dog. Chained to a fire hydrant and beaten badly, this dog howled miserably while the man laughed loudly. The entire incident was recorded and uploaded online. This 17?second video fueled general anger. Carrying out human flesh search, some netizens started to track down this man. In just 18 hours, they collected plenty of information about this man and reported him to Animal Rescue Team Taiwan. In the end, he was forced to apologize publicly for what he had done and promise that this would never happen again. ¡@¡@Nevertheless, human flesh search doesn¡¦t always lead to happy endings. In the U.S.A., a twelve-year-old girl committed suicide after being bullied over the Internet for months. The girl got into trouble with some schoolmates one year before the tragedy happened, and the bullying began not only at school but also on the Net. At first, the girl complained to her parents about it, and they allowed her to stay home from school in the hope of stopping the situation from worsening. Meanwhile, the girl changed her screen name, deleted her Facebook account, and decided to switch schools for the new semester. Unfortunately, those cyber-bullies found the victim through different social media sites and continued making nasty remarks about her, and even using abusive language against her. Since the girl was unable to stand the torture of being bullied anymore, she killed herself to end her misery. ¡@¡@Based on the instances above, it is no wonder that the Los Angeles Times once commented that ¡§human flesh search engines¡¨ might overshadow the FBI, since a group of netizens might be more efficient than any agent could ever possibly be. Yet, whether this way of searching is right remains a question. When netizens are trying to discover the truth about something or bring someone to justice, some of them might violate the privacy of other Internet users. Even worse, a few may become a violent cybermob, taking advantage of their freedom of speech to pursue their so-called ¡§justice.¡¨ Netizens should avoid doing these things so that everyone can enjoy the convenience that the Internet provides. After all, the Internet should be used to connect people rather than separate them or, what¡¦s worse, make them suffer. ¡XDouglas A. Hinnant. Revised by J. P. Raptor. 
Unit 5  A Human War for a Dispute Among Gods. ¡§Was this the face that launched a thousand ships  And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?  Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.¡¨ ¡XDoctor Faustus ¡@¡@From this famous quote, it is clear that Helen¡¦s beauty was seen as the cause of the Trojan War. In fact, Helen¡¦s beauty had caused the Trojan prince Paris to kidnap her. Helen¡¦s husband, the king of Sparta, then declared war on Troy for this. However, it was neither Paris¡¦s passion nor the king¡¦s anger that burned down Troy, the city which at the time was second to none on Earth. The seeds of its destruction had already been sowed as a result of a dispute among three jealous goddesses, long before the war. ¡@¡@In Greek mythology, gods and goddesses were often involved in the conflicts between mortals. This was exactly what happened with the Trojan War, which the myths said actually erupted because Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite had a fight over a golden apple marked with the words ¡§For the Fairest¡¨ on it. To avoid offending any of the three goddesses, Zeus refused to judge for them. Instead, he commanded that Paris handle this difficult and annoying task. Knowing that Paris was going to be the judge, the three goddesses each promised him the best gift they could give in order to win the golden apple: Hera tried to bribe him with power over Europe and Asia; Athena offered him great skills in battle and wisdom; Aphrodite gave him her word that she would help him win the heart of the most beautiful woman in the world. Eventually, Paris chose Aphrodite after long thought. As a result, it was ¡§the Judgment of Paris¡¨ that ended up being the real reason the Trojan War broke out. ¡@¡@Later, Aphrodite fulfilled her promise by casting a spell on Helen. Aphrodite also helped Paris bring Helen with him to Troy. Upon learning what had happened, the king of Sparta was so furious that he called for help from several rulers of other Greek states. Ten years of war between these Greek allies and Troy followed. As time went by, the former won many battles but still couldn¡¦t conquer the latter. The Greeks, therefore, turned to Athena in the hope of ending the war. Athena, who was still angry about Paris¡¦s choice, provided the Greeks with the key to winning the final victory by saying, ¡§What began with an apple must end with a horse.¡¨ ¡@¡@Thanks to Athena, the Greeks realized what they needed to do. A Greek hero named Odysseus came up with a cunning plan. He had his men build a huge wooden horse that was hollow inside and had a group of armed soldiers hide in it. Next, the Greek army pretended to accept defeat. Before sailing home, though, they left the wooden horse standing in front of the gate of Troy. The Trojans considered this to be a gift of peace. In a mood to celebrate, they hauled the horse into their city and started feasting and rejoicing. But later, in the dead of night, the Greek soldiers in the horse crept out and opened the city gate. Then, the rest of the Greek army was able to launch a successful surprise attack, bringing an end to the war and victory to the Greeks. ¡@¡@As in many other Greek myths, it seems that the humans in the Trojan War were like chess pieces in the hands of gods. If Paris had not been forced to be the judge, the Trojan War might not have even begun. To the gods, this terrible war was nothing more than just a game. ¡@¡@¡XTheodore Pigott 
Unit 8  A Memorable Event. 	Charlie Chaplin was a prominent comedian who starred in many silent movies. The following story tells us something important that happened to him and his mother in his childhood. 	I was born in London on April 16, 1889. According to Mother, my world was a happy one. Our circumstances were moderately comfortable; we rented an apartment with three tastefully furnished rooms. One of my early memories was that each night before Mother went to work, she would tenderly tuck me in. 	My lovely mother was a singer. Unfortunately, in her late twenties, she suffered from laryngitis, but she was obliged to keep working in order to support our family. Because of this condition, my mother¡¦s voice would crack or suddenly faded out in the middle of the performance. The audience would laugh and start booing. As her voice grew progressively worse, she could no longer rely on it. 	It was owing to her voice condition that I made my debut on the stage at the age of five. If my mother hadn¡¦t had laryngitis, I wouldn¡¦t have begun my performing career at such an early age. 	One night, in preference to leaving me alone at home, Mother took me to the dirty, mean theater she worked at. It catered mostly to soldiers who needed no excuse to mock and ridicule whoever was performing onstage. There¡¦s no denying that for most performers, that theater was a place of terror. 	I remembered standing in the wings when Mother¡¦s voice cracked and went into a whisper again. The audience began to laugh and make fun of her. The whole thing was vague to me, and I did not quite understand what was going on. It was not until Mother stepped off the stage that the noise stopped. When she came backstage, she was very upset. The stage manager, who had seen me perform before, suggested that I go on in place of Mother. In chaos, he took me by the hand and led me onto the stage. 	After a few words of explanation to the audience, the manager left me on the stage alone. Then, accompanied by the orchestra, I started to sing. Halfway through my performance, a shower of money poured onto the stage. Immediately, I paused and announced that I would pick up the money first and sing afterward. This caused much laughter. The stage manager came out and helped me gather up the money. Fearing that he was going to keep the money, I conveyed this thought to the audience. This made them explode with laughter, especially when the manager walked off with the money¡Xwith me anxiously following him. Not until he handed all the money to Mother did I return to the stage and continue singing. 	After I felt more at home onstage, I began to talk to the audience, dance, and do several imitations. I even imitated Mother¡¦s voice cracking. The audience¡¦s reaction surprised me. There was laughter and cheers followed by more money thrown onto the stage. When Mother came on the stage to carry me off, her presence drew deafening applause. That night was my first appearance on the stage, and Mother¡¦s last. ¡XAdapted from My Autobiography by Charlie Chaplin.
Unit 9  Our True Self Lies Within. 	Psychologists in the U.S.A. once conducted a psychological study called the ¡§Scar Experiment,¡¨ which stirred up a lot of public discussion. At the beginning of the experiment, the researchers told ten volunteers that the objective of this experiment was to observe how people would respond when seeing someone with a physical defect, particularly a person with a scar on his or her face. After learning about the purpose of the study, volunteers in this experiment were then placed in separate rooms with no mirrors. There, a make?up artist put an artificial scar on the left cheek of each participant. Then, the participant was shown his or her new look. Next, they were informed that a sticky substance would be applied to their faces for fear that the make?up might come off. The false scar, however, was actually secretly swept away. 	Later, these people were sent to the waiting rooms of different clinics to experience how people would react to them. Afterward, when they returned to the research laboratory, they reported that people were unfriendly to them and repeatedly peeped at their scars. In reality, these volunteers looked the same as usual. Their consciousness of other people¡¦s unkind acts was a result of their own assumption: They believed that the scar would inevitably draw people¡¦s attention and cause other people to treat them rudely and offensively. That is, they were influenced by a sense of inferiority. 	A sense of inferiority, according to the researchers, is strongly associated with the environment in which one develops. If children get criticized continually as they become mature, they are bound to be confronted with an identity crisis and may even cheapen themselves in the course of time. As kids grow up, negative remarks can turn into mental scars. These negative remarks may also bruise their egos, shake their confidence, and, hence, affect how they value themselves. 	Lena Maria¡¦s life story is a great example of how environment can be a significant influence on that person. Physically challenged from birth, Lena has only one leg and no upper limbs. Even so, her parents raised her like an ordinary kid for fear of having her believe that she was inferior to others. Her parents¡¦ love for her has known no bounds, and this has made her appreciate her life, however limited it might be. What¡¦s more, her cheerful mentality has always spiced up her life. For example, one day, a girl in her class intended to embarrass her by sarcastically saying, ¡§Good morning, Girl With Only One Leg.¡¨ Not even upset, Lena replied with a beaming smile, ¡§Good morning, Two-legged Girl.¡¨ Apparently, she has never felt different from others, despite her birth defects. 	Whether we are facially scarred or physically deficient in some way, others can¡¦t hurt our feelings as long as we bravely embrace ourselves and enjoy life to the fullest. However, if we deprive ourselves of our own self-esteem and regard ourselves as unworthy, then a mere pimple on the face can cause us to have insecurity problems in our relationships. Don¡¦t let a sense of inferiority, a scar, or even a pimple steer us wrong. After all, people see us just the way we see ourselves. ¡XJ. P. Raptor
