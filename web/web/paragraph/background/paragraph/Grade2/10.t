Lesson Five  Asking Nature for Advice. ¡@¡@Some frogs naturally freeze1 solid2 in winter, then thaw3 and hop4 away in the spring. In Ottawa1, Canada2, scientists are studying these frozen frogs. They believe these frogs hold the secret for safer organ5 transplants6. Hearts, for example, could be safely frozen and then thawed when needed. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@These Canadian scientists aren¡¦t the only ones looking to nature for inspiration7. More and more inventors are also discovering8 that the natural world contains many useful designs9. These inventors are not looking for what they can take, but rather what they can learn, from nature. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Inventions based on nature are nothing new. Over a century ago, the Wright3 brothers, the inventors of the airplane, studied how birds fly. They watched details such as how flying birds adjusted10 their wings to turn. By applying11 their observations to their new invention, the Wright brothers were able to fly like a bird. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@In the 1940s, a Swiss4 engineer, George de Mestral5, noticed burs6 sticking to his pants. He examined one of these burs under his microscope12 and found tiny hooks13 on the end of it. Based on this concept, Mestral invented Velcro7. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Today, inventors are still finding great ideas in nature¡¦s designs. Take, for example, the lotus8. This plant often grows in muddy14 environments15, but remains dry and clean. German9 scientists discovered that its leaves are covered with tiny needles. Dust16 and dirt17 fall on the needle tips18 and readily19 wash away when it rains. Lotusan10, a German company, used this same concept to make ¡§self-cleaning¡¨ house paint. When dried, the paint surface20 resembles21 bumps on a lotus leaf. Scientists are now hoping to create a similar paint for cars. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Imagine a string22 as thick as a pencil stopping a flying jet11. No, it¡¦s not a cartoon12. In theory, it could work. Spider silk23 is five times stronger than steel24. It¡¦s even stronger than Kevlar13¡Xthe toughest25 man-made material. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Spiders, however, can¡¦t be farmed26. They¡¦d eat each other. So scientists put spider genes inside goats. Then they collected and processed27 the goat¡¦s milk. The result? Spider silk from milk! Its uses may include stronger bulletproof14 vests and safer bridges. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Learn from nature. You¡¦ll be surprised by its great designs. 
Lesson Six   Emily Dickinson and Her Poems. ¡@¡@Many great writers were active1 people who had strange experiences, traveled widely, and knew a lot of people. Do you think a woman who just stayed home, hardly ever saw anyone, and only published2 seven poems during her lifetime could be a great poet? Well, Emily Dickinson1 was. In fact, she is considered one of the greatest American poets of the nineteenth century. She was a rather3 unusual person. She seldom left her house, she never married, and she always dressed in white. But she wrote wonderful poems about nature, love, life, and death. Her poems are short and not hard to read, but they have deep meanings. See if you can figure out the meanings of the poems that follow. If I Can Stop One Heart from Breaking If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain; If I can ease one life the aching4, Or cool5 one pain, Or help one fainting6 robin2 Unto his nest again, I shall not live in vain. I¡¦m Nobody7! Who Are You? I¡¦m nobody! Who are you? Are you nobody too? Then there¡¦s a pair of us? Don¡¦t tell! They¡¦d advertise, you know! How dreary8 to be somebody9! How public¡Xlike a frog¡X To tell one¡¦s name the livelong3 June To an admiring10 bog4! Hope Is the Thing with Feathers Hope is the thing with feathers That perches11 in the soul12, And sings the tune13 without the words, And never stops at all. And sweetest in the gale5 is heard; And sore14 must be the storm That could abash6 the little bird That kept so many warm. I¡¦ve heard it in the chilliest15 land, And on the strangest sea; Yet, never, in extremity16, It asked a crumb7 of me. 
Eat Better, Look Better. ¡@¡@Would you believe that your diet can make a big difference in helping you to keep a youthful1 appearance? It seems strange to think that the food we take in could result in fewer wrinkles. Wouldn¡¦t it be better to put things on our skin rather than in our mouths? ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Well, according to one scientific2 theory, our bodies start aging3 because of oxidation1. This means that certain oxygen2-containing molecules in our cells4, called free radicals5, have the capability6 to attach7 to and damage8 parts of our cells, including our DNA3. Our bodies can repair9 this damage, but as we get older, these repair mechanisms4 start to break down, resulting in the signs of aging. Free radicals are actually10 produced by our bodies, but their numbers can also increase because of the food we eat. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Besides avoiding foods that could potentially11 produce more free radicals, eating foods that contain certain vitamins and micro5-nutrients12 can also contribute13 to keeping us looking young. These vitamins help produce molecules called antioxidants6, which actually help reduce the production of free radicals. Even better, foods containing antioxidants are not rare. Common antioxidants, like vitamins A and E, can be found in many dark-colored vegetables. For example, carrots14, seaweed7, spinach15, and broccoli8 are all excellent sources16 of these helpful vitamins. Also, you can eat orange-colored fruits like apricots9 and peaches. Vitamins A and E are particularly good for helping your skin remain young-looking. These nutrients strengthen your skin and make it soft. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@More recently, green tea has also been tentatively17 added to the list of youth-promoting substances18. Although research about the effects of green tea on our bodies is at an early stage, many scientists believe that it is good for us. They are still cautious19, however, about predicting its capability to keep us looking youthful. But from recent experiments, its antioxidant properties20 seem to be able to repair cell damage already sustained21 as well as to prevent damage in the future. In fact, green tea works even better if you apply22 it directly23 to your skin as an ingredient in facial24 cream. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@¡§You are what you eat.¡¨ The more we find out about how our bodies work, the more this old proverb25 seems to be true. Think about that the next time you sit down at the table. 
The Happy Whitewasher. ¡@¡@Saturday morning had come, and all the summer world was bright and fresh. There was a song in every heart and happiness in every step. The locust1 trees were in bloom and their fragrance2 filled the air. ¡@¡@Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash1 and a brush. He surveyed2 the fence, and all gladness left him. Thirty yards of fence3, nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden3. Sighing, he dipped4 his brush into the whitewash and passed it along the top. Then he compared the small whitewashed streak4 with the far-reaching5 continent5 of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down discouraged6. ¡@¡@He began to think of the fun he had planned for this day, and his sorrows grew even greater. Soon the free boys would come along on all sorts of adventures7, and they would make fun of him for having to work¡Xthe very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly8 wealth and examined it¡Xbits of toys, marbles6, and trash¡Xenough to buy an exchange9 of work, maybe, but not enough to buy half an hour of pure10 freedom. So he gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration flashed into his mind! Nothing less than a magnificent11 inspiration! ¡@¡@He took up his brush and went to work. Before long, Ben Rogers came in sight¡Xthe very boy, of all boys, he dreaded12 most. Ben was eating an apple, and giving a long whoop7, for he was pretending13 to be a steamboat8. ¡§Ting-a-ling-ling!¡¨ he shouted as he moved slowly down the street. ¡§Ting-a-ling-ling! Whoop! Ding-dong-dong! Ding-dong-dong!¡¨ ¡@¡@Tom went on whitewashing, paying no attention to the steamboat. Ben stopped his boat and stared a moment and then said, ¡§Hi! You have to work today, don¡¦t you?¡¨ ¡@¡@No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist. Ben walked up alongside14 him. Tom¡¦s mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said, ¡§Say, I¡¦m going swimming. Don¡¦t you wish you could? But of course you¡¦d rather work.¡¨ ¡@¡@Tom looked slowly over at the boy, and said, ¡§What do you call work?¡¨ ¡@¡@¡§Why, isn¡¦t that work?¡¨ ¡@¡@Tom resumed15 his whitewashing, and said carelessly, ¡§Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn¡¦t. All I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer.¡¨ ¡@¡@¡§Come on, you don¡¦t mean to let on that you like it?¡¨ ¡@¡@The brush continued to move. ¡@¡@¡§Like it? Well, I don¡¦t see why I shouldn¡¦t. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?¡¨ ¡@¡@That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling16 his apple. Tom swept his brush back and forth¡Xstepped back to note the effect17¡Xadded a touch here and there¡Xcriticized the effect again. Ben watched every move, getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed18. After a short time, he said, ¡§Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.¡¨ ¡@¡@Tom considered¡Xwas about to consent19, but he changed his mind. ¡@¡@¡§No, no¡XI don¡¦t think so. You see, Aunt Polly¡¦s awfully particular about this fence. I guess there isn¡¦t one boy in a thousand that can do it the way it¡¦s got to be done.¡¨ ¡@¡@¡§Oh, come on, lemme try.¡¨ ¡@¡@¡§Ben, I¡¦d like to, honest, but¡X¡¨ ¡@¡@¡§Oh, I¡¦ll be careful. Say, I¡¦ll give you the core9 of my apple.¡¨ ¡@¡@¡§No, Ben, I¡¦m afraid¡X¡¨ ¡@¡@¡§I¡¦ll give you all of it!¡¨ ¡@¡@Tom gave up the brush with reluctance20 in his face but eagerness21 in his heart. And while the late steamboat worked and sweated22 in the sun, the retired23 artist sat on a barrel10 in the shade24, dangled11 his legs, ate his apple, and planned how he would trick25 more of the boys. There was no lack of victims: boys walked along every little while; they came to jeer12, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was tired out, Tom had traded26 the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, and when he was worn out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with¡Xand so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poverty-stricken27 boy in the morning, Tom was rolling in wealth. He had, besides the things mentioned, twelve marbles, a piece of blue bottle-glass, a key that wouldn¡¦t unlock28 anything, a piece of chalk, a toy soldier, six firecrackers, a kitten with only one eye, a doorknob13, a rusty29 knife, four pieces of orange peel14, and an old window frame. ¡@¡@He had had a nice idle30 time all the while¡Xand plenty of company¡Xand the fence had three coats31 of whitewash on it! If he hadn¡¦t run out of whitewash, he would have bankrupted32 every boy in the village. ¡@¡@Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action: in order to make a man covet33 a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain34. ¡@¡@

ï»¿ããThe tradition of matchmaking* has existed in many societies for thousands of years. The older generation, especially parents, did not consider young people mature enough to find a suitable partner for life. So parents often took it upon themselves to arrange matches for young people, and sometimes they hired professional matchmakers* to do the job. The parents and matchmakers would take several things into consideration, such as the educational level and the compatibility of the social and financial status of the two families. They then made the choice themselves for fear that the young men and women, on their own, would choose a mate merely on the basis of physical attraction. This matchmaking system also ensured that the social classes could be preserved. ããIn the 2th century, arranged marriages based on this age-old* matchmaking system began to be despised while âlove marriagesâ became the trend. More and more young people insisted on the right to seek their own partners. However, as modern life becomes more hectic* and complex, many single people donât have the time and energy to find a mate for themselves. They are once again seeking help in finding a compatible partner. Thatâs why professional matchmaking firms using computer technology are playing Cupid these days. ããThese professional matchmaking firms usually require that users fill out a long questionnaire* online and take tests that determine personality traits and values*. They then sort through user information based on criteria* like educational background, financial status, and physical features. With the help of the Internet and other âscientificâ methods, they would recommend potential matches for clients who donât have the time, the chance, or the courage for personal encounters. ããIn fact, online matchmaking is becoming a booming industry around the world. A survey done in 2 by a leading website indicated that 5% of Internet users in Taiwan were single, meaning the countryâs market for online dating services has enormous potential. One of the online matchmaking giants in America even claims that every day 1 U.S. couples who meet on its site are tying the knot, accounting for 2% of all U.S. marriages taking place on the same day. ããDespite its popularity, high-tech online matchmaking also gives rise to various problems. For example, some users may lie in their profiles. Others may set their sights too high, hoping for the âperfectâ matchâwhich of course does not even exist. Furthermore, online friendship doesnât necessarily translate into real-life compatibility. That is to say, someone who seems to have everything youâre looking for may actually be boring or annoying in real life. On the other hand, someone whose profile you ignore or delete because he or she doesnât meet your standards might be just the special someone you are looking for. ããBased on the information mentioned above, it seems that the bottom line* is that any form of matchmaking simply creates an opportunity for eligible* young people to get out and meet others. Unless you really know what you need in a partner and a relationship, these âmeansâ of matchmaking might not guarantee a lifelong relationship that satisfies both of you. After all, itâs risky* to let a computer determine who your better half* is, and what the rest of your life will be like. 
ï»¿ããJason Wu ordered a pizza at his apartment and sat down with his friends to watch TV on the day of President Barack Obama*âs inauguration*. âHow good-looking is my wife?â President Obama praised. Wu turned, only to discover that the ivory chiffon* gown the First Lady* was wearing on TV was actually one of his creations. The body-hugging* dress showed off Michelle Obamaâs slim figure and the white color flattered her dark skin tone. Overwhelmed, Wu immediately phoned his parents, and when his mother answered, he said tearfully, âMom! I made it! No one will ever laugh at us again.â The dress caught the worldâs attention and had everyone asking: âWho is this Jason Wu?â ããWu is a Manhattan-based* Asian-American fashion designer. Born in Taiwan, he moved to Canada with his family at the age of nine. As a child, Wu was shy and reserved. Unlike most other boys who played sports or video games, Wu was fascinated by dolls and their clothing. He would even ask his mother to take him to bridal stores so he could sketch the gowns on display. At first, Wuâs mother dismissed this unusual interest as a childhood phase and hoped that it would eventually pass. But when she saw her sonâs talent and realized this was his passion, she encouraged him to strive for his dreams. To avoid the inquiring eyes of relatives, she even converted the basement into a workroom for him. Wuâs mother did not force him to study but placed more emphasis on developing values like kindness and humility. Had his mother not supported him, Wu would never have been able to pursue and realize his dreams. ããIn addition to his motherâs support, Wuâs sheer* determination and hard work also contributed to his success. When he moved to Canada, he had to juggle studying English and learning how to sew, draft patterns and sketch designs. Sometimes he would lose his patience while sewing; sometimes he would become frustrated and discouraged. But he never gave up. At age fifteen, he submitted his designs and won a fashion doll design contest. Within two years, he was named the creative director of Integrity Toys*, a $ million high-end* doll company. ããAs a university freshman, Wu started working part-time at a restaurant patronized* by many fashion designers. Despite already having an income from making dolls, he still insisted on working his way up to a waiterâs position just so that he could get acquainted with some fashion designers and seek internship* opportunities. Wuâs dedication is also reflected in his working style. When he launched his own brand in 2, he employed only one or two people at his workroom and did the rest of the work himself in order to cut costs. If it had not been for his perseverance, he would not have been able to achieve so much at such a young age. He has held several fashion shows in New York and won many awards, including the much-acclaimed* CFDA* Swarovski Award for Womenswear*. ããDespite his success, Wu has not forgotten the importance of humility and the lessons his mother taught him. His kind personality and soft-spoken manner have earned him the reputation of being a humble and polite new star in the fashion industry. Looking at his success story, we see that it was not only his hard work and dedication but also his parentsâ open-minded attitude and way of teaching that made it all possible. Thankful for his parentsâ support, Wu sends out the message: âI hope all parents can recognize their childrenâs talents, fully support them, and give them the opportunity to grow and learn.â 
Apollo and Daphne. ¡@¡@Cupid was playing with his bow and arrows under a tree one day when Apollo rode by on his golden chariot. Apollo made fun of the boy, saying, ¡§Do not play with weapons, Cupid. They are not for a child like you!¡¨ His words outraged Cupid, who thought, ¡§I am a great archer whose arrows never miss. How could he insult me like this?¡¨ Cupid then decided to take revenge on Apollo by playing a trick on him. He took out two arrows, one made of gold to trigger love, and the other made of lead to repel love. ¡§Let¡¦s wait and see,¡¨ Cupid said to himself. ¡§Apollo¡¦s arrows may strike whatever he aims at, but mine will get him!¡¨ ¡@¡@Before long, Cupid found Apollo walking alone in the woods and hit him with his golden arrow. At that time, Daphne, daughter of the river god Peneus, happened to be passing by, and Apollo immediately fell in love with her. Daphne was as independent as she was beautiful, so she had vowed to remain unmarried. Cupid, not missing this great chance, took out his leaden arrow, aimed at Daphne, and shot it.  ¡@¡@Under the spell of the golden arrow, Apollo followed Daphne, trying to talk to her. However, when Daphne saw him, she was startled, and she fled as fast as the wind. ¡§Do not run away from me like a sheep from a wolf!¡¨ Apollo called after her, ¡§It is for love that I pursue you. You make me miserable for fear that you should fall and hurt yourself! Please slow down and wait for me!¡¨ Daphne would not listen; she went on running. Yet, to Apollo, even when Daphne was running in panic she still seemed charming! ¡§Wait, my love! I am no rude man but Apollo, god of the sun, music, and poetry. I am falling in love with you!¡¨ ¡@¡@Daphne was an excellent runner, but Apollo was a powerful god. He kept behind her and steadily got closer and closer. When Daphne¡¦s strength began to fail, her panic was intensified by the feel of Apollo¡¦s breath upon her neck. She called out to the river in front of her, ¡§Father, help me! Save me from this danger!¡¨ Suddenly a sense of numbness came over her, and her feet seemed to be rooted in the earth. Bark began to enclose her body, and leaves sprouted from her arms. She had changed into a beautiful laurel tree. ¡@¡@Apollo was shocked and heartbroken. He held the laurel tree, which still shuddered at his touch, in his arms, whispering, ¡§You will be my tree. I will wear your leaves for my crown. Victors and poets will wear your leaves, too. You will be blessed with eternal life.¡¨ ¡@¡@¡@¡@¡@¡@¡@¡@¡@¡@¡@¡@¡@¡@¡@¡Xadapted from Greek and Roman mythology 
Eureka! ¡@¡@There once was a king of Syracuse named Hiero. The country over which he reigned was quite small, but for that very reason he wanted to wear the biggest crown in the world. So he called in a famous goldsmith, who was skillful with all kinds of fine work, and gave him ten pounds of pure gold.  ¡@¡@"Fashion this into a crown that shall make every other king covet it," Hiero instructed. "Be sure that you put into it every grain of the gold I give you, and do not mix any other metal with it." ¡@¡@The goldsmith promised that within ninety days he would return to the king the crown he wished.      Ninety days later, true to his word, the goldsmith brought the crown. All who saw it agreed that such a beautiful crown had no equal in the world. When King Hiero put it on his head it felt very uncomfortable, but he did not mind that-- he was sure that no other king had so fine a headpiece. Admiring it from all sides, King Hiero then weighed it on his own scales, and it weighed exactly ten pounds.      There was in the king's court a very wise man named Archimedes. When called in to admire the king's crown, he turned it over many times and examined it very closely. He wondered why the gold was a brilliant yellow, instead of the same rich red color that it had been in the lump.        "What if the goldsmith has kept out a pound or two of the gold and made up the weight by adding brass or silver?" asked Archimedes.      "Oh, he would not do that," said Hiero. "The gold has merely changed its color in the working." But the more he thought of the matter, the less pleased he was with the crown. "Is there any way to find out whether that goldsmith cheated me or honestly gave me back my gold?" ¡@¡@¡@"I know of no way," was the answer. But Archimedes was not a man to say that anything was impossible. He took great delight in solving hard problems, and when any question puzzled him, he would persevere until he found some sort of answer to it. So, day after day, he thought about the gold, trying to figure out how to have it tested without damaging the crown. ¡@¡@One morning he was pondering this question while getting ready for a bath. The tub was full to the very edge, and as he stepped in, a quantity of water flowed out upon the stone floor.  ¡@¡@"How much water did I displace by getting into the tub?" he asked himself. "Anybody can see that I displaced a bulk of water equal to the bulk of my body.  ¡@¡@"Now suppose I put Hiero's crown into water; it will displace a bulk of water equal to its own bulk. Gold is much heavier than silver. Ten pounds of pure gold will not make so great a bulk as, say, seven pounds of gold mixed with three pounds of silver. If Hiero's crown is pure gold, it will displace the same amount of water as any other ten-pound weight of pure gold. But if it is part gold and part silver, it will displace a larger bulk. Eureka! Eureka!" Forgetting everything else, Archimedes leaped from the bath. He ran naked through the streets to the king's palace shouting "Eureka!" which in English means, "I have found it!"  ¡@¡@The crown was tested and found to displace much more water than ten pounds of pure gold. The guilt of the goldsmith was proved beyond a doubt.  
ï»¿ ããA group of young people were going to Florida1. They got on the bus at 34th Street, carrying sandwiches and wine1 in paper bags, dreaming of golden beaches and sea tides2 as the gray, cold spring of New York vanished3 behind them. ããVingo2 was on the bus from the beginning.  ããAs the bus passed through New Jersey3, they began to observe4 that Vingo never moved. He was sitting in front of the young people, dressed in a plain5 suit6 that did not fit7 him. His fingers were stained8 from smoking too many cigarettes9 . ããDeep into the night, the bus stopped at a restaurant and everybody got  off except Vingo. The young people began to wonder about him: perhaps  he was a sea captain10; maybe he had run away from his wife; he could be an  old soldier11 going home. When they went back to the bus, one of the girls sat beside him and introduced herself. ããâWeâre going to Florida,â she said brightly. âI hear itâs really beautiful.â  ãâIt is,â he said quietly, as if recalling12 something he had tried to forget.  ããâAre you married?â   ããâI donât know.â   ããâYou donât know?â she said.  ããâWell,â he said shyly. âWhen I was in jai1l3, I wrote to my wife. I told her that if she couldnât stand it, if the kids kept asking questions, if it hurt too much, well, she could just forget me. Iâd understand. I told her she didnât  have to write me. And she didnât. Not for three and a half years.â  ããâYou are going home now, even though you havenât heard anything?â  the girl asked. ããâWell, last week when I was sure I would get parole4, I wrote her again.  We used to live in this town, Brunswick5, and thereâs a great big oak14 tree just  as you come into town. I told her if sheâd take me back, she should put a yellow ribbon15 on the tree, and Iâd get off and come home. If she didnât want me, forget it; no ribbon and Iâd keep on going through.â   ããâWow6,â the girl said. âWow.â   ããShe told the others, and they all became excited. As the bus approached16 Brunswick, Vingo was showing them a picture of his wife and three children. Now they were twenty miles from Brunswick, and the young people took  over window seats on the right side, waiting for the approach16 of the great oak tree. Vingo stopped looking out; he seemed to be getting ready for a great disappointment. As the bus neared Brunswick, the passengers became very quiet. ãThen suddenly all of the young people were up out of their seats, screaming17 and shouting18, doing small dances, shaking19 fists20 in triumph21 and joy. All except Vingo.  ããVingo sat there astonished22, looking at the oak tree. It was covered with yellow ribbons, twenty of them, thirty of them, maybe hundreds. The tree  stood like a flag23 of welcome, fluttering and waving in the wind. As the young people shouted, Vingo slowly stood up from his seat and made his way to the front of the bus. He was going home. 
ï»¿ ããMathilde1 was one of those pretty and charming young girls who were  born into a family of clerks3. She had no hope of being matched with any rich man, so she married a clerk of a government4 office.  ããShe dressed plainly because she didnât have any pretty dresses, and she suffered because she felt that she deserved the delicacies5 and all luxuries6. She would have liked so much to be pleased, to be envied7, to be charming, and to be sought after.  ããOne evening, her husband reached home holding a large envelope8.  âThere is something for you,â he said.  ããShe tore the envelope quickly and drew out a card that read:  ããThe Minister9 of Public Instruction10 requests the honor11 of M.2 and Madame Loiselâs3 company at the palace12 of the Ministry9 on Monday evening, January 18th. ããHowever, she was not delighted with the news, and she threw the invitation13 on the table.  ããâWhat do you wish me to do with that?â she asked angrily. ããâWhy, my dear, I thought you would be glad. You never go out, and this is a very special opportunity. It was very difficult for me to get the invitation.â   ããShe looked at him with an irritated14 glance and said impatiently15: âAnd what do you wish me to wear?â   ããâWhat about the gown16 you wear to the theater? It looks very nice to  me,â he answered.  ããHe stopped, seeing that his wife was weeping17.  ããâWhatâs the matter?â he asked.  ããâNothing. Only I have no lovely gown. With  no gown I canât go to this ball.â   ããâWell, how much would a suitable gown,  which you can wear over again, cost?â   ããâMaybe four hundred francs4,â she replied. ããHe grew a little pale18, but said, âVery well. I will  give you four hundred francs for a suitable gown.â  ããThe day of the ball drew near and Madame Loisel seemed sad and anxious19.  ããâWhat is the matter?â asked Loisel.	 ããâIt frustrates20 me not to have a single piece of jewelry21 to put on.â  ããâHow silly you are!â her husband cried. âGo look up your dear old  friend, Madame Forestier5, and ask her to lend you some jewels21. Youâre intimate22 enough with her to do that.â   ããâTrue! I never thought of it,â she exclaimed23 happily.  ããThe next day she went to her friend and told her of her distress.  ããMadame Forestier took out a large jewel box and asked Madame Loisel to choose the one that she liked.  ããShe tried on many pieces until she found a special diamond necklace. She put it on, and asked, âCan I have this one?â   ããâWhy, yes, certainly.â  ããShe hugged her friend, and then hurried home with the necklace.  ããThe night of the ball arrived. Madame Loisel was prettier than any   other woman present. All the men looked at her, asked her name, wishing    to be introduced. She danced and danced forgetting all her troubles. She felt special and beautiful with the attention she received. ããShe and her husband left the ball about four oâclock in the morning.  With so many people rushing out trying to get a cab6 home, Mathilde and her husband had to walk in the cold for more than a few blocks until they could find a cab. When they reached home, she took off her wrap and suddenly  cried out.  ããâWhat is the matter with you?â asked her husband.  ããâThe necklace is gone.â   ããâWhat! How? Impossible!â exclaimed her husband. ããHe went outside to look for the necklace, following the same route24  where they had walked, but it was useless to do so.  ããFinally, after a dreadful25 week, Loisel decided, âWe must replace26 the lost necklace.â  ããThey went from shop to shop, and finally found a necklace that seemed exactly like the one they had lost. It cost thirty-six thousand francs.  ããLoisel possessed27 eighteen thousand francs which his father had left him and he planned to borrow the rest. His life would be ruined. ããWhen Madame Loisel took the necklace to Madame Forestier, she said coolly28, âYou should have returned it earlier.â  ããFrom then on, Madame Loisel knew how awful29 it was to be needy. They had to pay off the debt30. They let their maid31 go and moved to a small, cheap apartment. Mathilde had to bargain carefully at the market and she learned how unpleasant housework could be. Her husband worked evenings, copying manuscripts32 to earn a little more money. ããAfter ten years of living in miserable poverty, they had paid everything back. Madame Loisel looked old nowâstrong, hard, and rough like any working woman youâd see on the street.  ããAnd then, one Sunday, having gone for a walk in the park to relax after the hard work of the week, she suddenly saw a woman who looked familiar. It was Madame Forestier! But, she still looked young and pretty.  ããShe went up to her old friend.  ã  âGood-day, Jeanne7.â   ããThe other, not recognizing her at all, said, âButâMadame!âI do not know....â   ããâNo. Iâm Mathilde Loisel.â   ããâOh, my poor Mathilde! How you are changed!â   ããâYes, I have had a hard life since I last saw youâand that is because of you!â   ããâBecause of me! How so?â   ããâDo you remember that diamond necklace you lent me to wear at the ball?â  ããâYes. Well?â   ããâWell, I lost it.â   ããâWhat do you mean? You brought it back.â   ããâI brought you back another one exactly like it. And it has taken us ten years to pay for it. At last the nightmare is over, and Iâm very glad.â   ããâYou mean that you bought a necklace of diamonds to replace mine?â   ããâYes. You never noticed it, then!â   ããMadame Forestier, deeply moved, took her old friendâs hands.  ããâOh, my poor Mathilde! Why, those were fake33 diamonds! The necklace was worth no more than five hundred francs!â  
 ¡@¡@Many people regard men and women as belonging to different cultures. This is shown in the differences of masculine1 and feminine2 styles of communication. To understand this issue1, consider the following cases of cultural difference in communication between the genders3.  Gender Gaps2 in Communication  Case I: Showing support ¡@¡@Rita is having dinner with her boyfriend, Mike. She is worried about a friend who drinks a lot. When Mike advises her to get her friend into counseling3, Rita repeats how worried she feels. Mike then tells Rita to make sure her friend does not drive after drinking. Rita explodes4  saying that she does not need advice5. Irritated6  at her lack7 of appreciation8 for his help, Mike asks, ¡§Then why did you talk about it?¡¨ With anger, Rita responds, ¡§Oh, never mind, I¡¦ll talk to Betty. At least she cares how I feel.¡¨ Case II: Giving feedback. ¡@¡@Roseanne and Drew are colleagues10 in an advertising company. One morning he drops into her off?ice to tell her about an idea for an advertisement. As Drew presents his ideas, Roseanne nods and responds with ¡§Um,¡¨ ¡§Uh huh,¡¨ and ¡§Yes.¡¨ When he finishes and asks for her comments11, Roseanne says, ¡§I really don¡¦t think that plan will sell the product.¡¨ Confused, Drew responds, ¡§Then why were you agreeing the whole time I was telling you my idea?¡¨ Completely confused, Roseanne responds, ¡§What makes you think I was agreeing with you?¡¨   Case III: Expressing feelings. ¡@¡@Dedrick and Melita have been dating for two years and are very serious about their relationship. To celebrate their anniversary, Melita wants to spend a quiet evening in her apartment where they can be together. However, when Dedrick arrives, he has already planned a dinner out followed by a concert12. Melita feels hurt that he does not want to talk and be close. ¡@¡@Who is right? It is easy for people to make judgments13 and to perceive14 differences as better or worse, not simply as different. But judging is not the best way to communicate. Understanding Cross-Gender Communication  ¡@¡@Trying to respect unique styles of communication might be more productive than judging one another. Men and women typically15 rely on distinct16 communication rules and have different ways of showing support, interest, and caring. This implies17 they may perceive the same communication in different ways.  ¡@¡@In the f?irst situation, Rita talks to Mike about her concern for her friend primarily18 because she wants him to respond to her feelings. She sees this as a way to feel closer to him. However, Mike views communication as an instrument19 to get things done, so he tries to help by giving advice, which causes Rita to feel that he does not care at all about her feelings.  ¡@¡@In the second example, it is obvious that women give lots of response cues¡Xverbal and nonverbal¡Xto indicate20 interest in conversation and build relationships. Masculine culture, however, focuses on outcomes21 more than processes, so men tend22 to use feedback to signal specific agreement and disagreement23. When Drew hears Roseanne¡¦s ¡§ums,¡¨  ¡§uh huhs,¡¨ and ¡§yeses,¡¨ he assumes24 she is agreeing.  ¡@¡@In the last example, Dedrick and Melita also experience a culture clash4 in their communication. Within feminine culture, talking is a way¡Xprobably the primary way¡Xto express feeling close. In contrast25, men generally experience ¡§closeness5 in doing.¡¨ A man is more likely to express his feelings for a woman by doing something concrete26 for her (washing her car) or doing something with her (skiing), than by talking explicitly27 about how or what he feels.  ¡@¡@Incorrect6 translations result in most problems in cross-gender communication. When we understand there are distinct gender cultures and when we respect each, we help ourselves to communicate in ways that make our relationships better. 
 MENDING WALL. Something there is that doesn¡¦t love a wall, That sends the frozen-ground-swell1 under it, And spills2 the upper2 boulders3 in the sun, And makes gaps even two can pass abreast4. The work of hunters is another thing: I have come after them and made repair Where they have left not one stone on a stone, But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, To please the yelping5 dogs. The gaps I mean, No one has seen them made or heard them made, But at spring mending-time we find them there. I let my neighbor know beyond the hill; And on a day we meet to walk the line And set the wall between us once again. We keep the wall between us as we go. To each the boulders that have fallen to each. And some are loaves6 and some so nearly balls We have to use a spell7 to make them balance: ¡¥Stay where you are until our backs are turned!¡¦ We wear3 our fingers rough with handling them. Oh, just another kind of outdoor4 game, One on a side. It comes to little more: There where it is we do not need the wall: He is all pine8 and I am apple orchard. My apple trees will never get across And eat the cones9 under his pines, I tell him. He only says, ¡¥Good fences10 make good neighbors.¡¦  Spring is the mischief11 in me, and I wonder If I could put a notion5 in his head: ¡¥Why do they make good neighbors? Isn¡¦t it Where there are cows? But here there are no cows. Before I built a wall I¡¦d ask to know What I was walling6 in or walling out, And to whom I was like to give offence. Something there is that doesn¡¦t love a wall, That wants it down.¡¦ I could say ¡¥Elves12¡¦ to him, But it¡¦s not elves exactly, and I¡¦d rather He said it for himself. I see him there Bringing a stone grasped7 firmly by the top In each hand, like an old-stone13 savage14 armed8.   He moves in darkness15 as it seems to me, Not of woods only and the shade of trees. He will not go behind his father¡¦s saying, And he likes having thought of it so well He says again, ¡§Good fences make good neighbors.¡¨   By Robert Frost16. ¡@¡@The speaker in Robert Frost¡¦s ¡§Mending Wall¡¨ is questioning the purpose of the wall between his and his neighbor¡¦s property9. Every year, the speaker and his neighbor need to repair the broken wall, yet, his neighbor is not interested in discussing whether or not the wall is necessary. ¡@¡§Something there is that doesn¡¦t love a wall.¡¨ ¡@¡@The speaker begins by claiming10 that something ¡§there¡¨ in nature seems to agree that the wall should be knocked down. And that ¡§something¡¨ might be the earth itself: ¡§That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,/And spills the upper boulders in the sun,/And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.¡¨ When the earth beneath the wall freezes in winter, it contracts11. Then when spring comes, the earth expands because of the heat from the sun. This causes the stones that form the wall to fall down, leaving big ¡§gaps¡¨ in the wall.  ¡@¡§The work of hunters is another thing.¡¨ ¡@¡@Even though the speaker mentions12 hunters may be responsible for these gaps as well because they destroy13 the sections as they follow their hunting dogs in pursuit14 of rabbits, by the line ¡§another thing,¡¨ we can see that the speaker does not think hunting is the main cause; instead, ¡§something¡¨ is. ¡@¡§And on a day we meet to walk the line.¡¨ ¡@¡@So the speaker arranges15 to meet with his neighbor and repair the wall. As they go about their mending, his neighbor remains on his side of the wall and the speaker on his own side. They trade17 rocks that belong to each other across the wall. Then the speaker describes what his stones look like: ¡§some are loaves and some so nearly balls.¡¨ Since stones are sometimes difficult to get back into place, the speaker has a little fun by saying, ¡§We have to use a spell to make them balance:/¡¥Stay where you are until our backs are turned!¡¦ ¡¨ ¡@¡§Oh, just another kind of outdoor game.¡¨ ¡@¡@The speaker tries to create an atmosphere of fun and cheerfulness. He remarks16 that this process of rebuilding the wall is just like an ¡§outdoor game,/One on a side.¡¨ The speaker does not think fixing the wall is important because his neighbor¡¦s property has only pine trees and his own property has only apple trees. Therefore, the speaker tries to persuade his neighbor to give up mending the wall: ¡§My apple trees will never get across/And eat the cones under his pines.¡¨ To this his neighbor just replies, ¡§Good fences make good neighbors.¡¨ The speaker teases17 himself by saying, ¡§Spring is the mischief in me,¡¨ as he playfully tries to get his neighbor to change his point of view about the wall. However, he turns sober18 when he tries to inject19 the idea of not rebuilding the wall and he realizes that his neighbor will not change his mind. ¡@¡§But here there are no cows.¡¨ ¡@¡@The speaker further explains that he could appreciate the need for fences if they had cows that might wander onto the other¡¦s property and do damage. But, since neither has any cows, it seems strange to keep a wall between them. If building walls were up to the speaker, he would want to be sure what the wall was for; or, he would be apt20 to consult21 his neighbor to make sure both neighbors have the same understanding about the need for the wall. ¡§Something there is that doesn¡¦t love a wall,¡¨ the speaker repeats his opening line, to which he now adds, ¡§That wants it down!¡¨ He now feels strongly that the wall is not necessary.  ¡@¡§I could say ¡¥Elves¡¦ to him.¡¨ ¡@¡@Mischievously11, the speaker imagines elves knocking down the wall. If he should think of mentioning this to his neighbor, his neighbor might think he is crazy. In the end, however, the speaker leaves off the ¡§elves¡¨ idea. His neighbor is not the kind of person who would appreciate a joke. The speaker finally decides not to say anything to his neighbor who continues doing the dull repair work and repeats what his father has always said, ¡§Good fences make good neighbors.¡¨ Failing to get a positive response from the neighbor, the only person the speaker amuses is himself. 
Unit 6  Positive Thinking and Happier Living. 	During the spring semester of 2006, Harvard University¡¦s Sanders Theatre swarmed with students every Tuesday and Thursday. More than eight hundred Harvard students majoring in different subjects had enrolled in Tal Ben-Shahar¡¦s course called ¡§Positive Psychology¡¨ to explore the secret of happiness. This course became the most popular one that semester, and Ben-Shahar later went on to publish several best-selling books to help people achieve happiness. Obviously, how to be happy is important not only to Harvard students but also to many other people around the world. 	Indeed, it seems that more and more people begin to feel confined in this fast-paced, increasingly competitive world. Students may come under pressure from their parents to reach high academic standards. As for adults, not only do many find it challenging to obtain a fulfilling career, but they also have a hard time striking a balance between their work and personal lives. What about parents? They need to handle many stressful situations, such as how to communicate effectively with their children and how to provide their children with a better living or learning environment. There is little doubt that happiness has become a burning issue for people in many different stages of their lives. 	If we ask Ben-Shahar what happiness is, he¡¦ll say that happiness is a state we can¡¦t arrive at unless we take account of the following three questions: What do we find most meaningful? What provides us with the most pleasure? Finally, what are we good at? To help us find happiness, Ben-Shahar offers six precise tips: Give yourself permission to be human. We won¡¦t feel happy unless we accept all of our emotions, including the negative ones. For students who get low grades at school, it¡¦s OK to feel disappointed. We don¡¦t have to suppress how we feel all the time. Do work and other activities that give you pleasure and provide you with meaning. Engaging in activities that are personally significant and enjoyable can bring us a lot of pleasure. If you like to travel and entertain people with stories, try working as a tour guide. You may find your job interesting, and, most importantly, you may find that you are confident and professional in your work. Happiness depends mostly on your state of mind. Ben-Shahar states that our happiness stems from both positive and negative experiences. Suppose a man loses his job. What can he do? He can view it as a catastrophe, or he can think positively and take it as an opportunity to get a better job. Simplify your daily tasks. Happiness can be found in avoiding doing too much. Don¡¦t pack excess activities into one day. Usually, there¡¦s not enough time to finish everything we list, and failing to complete the tasks as planned can frustrate us. Pay attention to your body. When we¡¦re tired, hungry, or physically inactive, we may end up compromising our happiness. Thus, we should exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and eat balanced meals to make sure that we are both physically and mentally healthy. Express gratitude, whenever possible. Don¡¦t take what you have for granted. Learn to appreciate and relish the wonderful things in life¡Ðeven just a smile from a stranger. 	Apparently, Ben-Shahar¡¦s advice shows us that positive thinking is the key to happiness. It can be something large¡Ðthe feeling of joy upon winning a big sports competition; or small¡Ðgetting satisfaction from a task finally completed. What¡¦s more, it¡¦s also important for us to stop envying what others have and to focus on what we alone can take pleasure in during our search for happiness. One thing is clear¡Ðfinding happiness can be a joyous lifetime pursuit. ¡ÐBy Junita Bognanni
Unit 7  Just a Brand Name, Not Your Name. 	Be yourself! 	Many people know the importance of being true to themselves, but unfortunately, more and more people are losing their sense of identity in a world overwhelmed by brand names. Whether or not an item is a brand-name product often plays a vital role in customers¡¦ decision making. A survey was recently conducted to find out how brand names influenced people¡¦s shopping choices. The results showed that roughly forty percent of those questioned agreed that the brand was more crucial than all the other factors. 	So, the question is this: Why do so many people prefer brand-name products? One of the biggest impacts is probably commercial advertising featuring entertainment and sports celebrities. Their endorsements of these brands send one message to the public: Image is important. 	Many people today believe owning brand-name products helps to strengthen their self-image and increase their confidence. They feel good about themselves while wearing, using, or eating brand-name items. For instance, some think they look slimmer and more attractive in jeans from a company that has hired famous models as its brand ambassadors. Others trust only Nike or Adidas shoes, for they believe their feet will not be suitably protected in shoes without those brand names. Still others insist that only drinks sold by Starbucks provide them with the refreshment they need. 	Ironically, this blind belief in the power of brand names actually reflects a person¡¦s lack of self-confidence, and it definitely doesn¡¦t contribute to the establishment of a positive self-image. When people buy designer goods, they buy into an image created by advertisers. When people respond to the advertisements and buy such products, they want to signal their value or uniqueness through the value or uniqueness of the brand. What¡¦s more, purchasing designer goods enables people to hide behind an image created by others because they don¡¦t have the independence or originality to create their own image or style. This phenomenon is particularly evident in teenagers who pay special attention to their appearance. 	The impact of designer clothes on the young seems to be more tremendous than that of any other type of clothing. Some young people believe that the only way they can make a good impression on others is to dress in designer clothing. These days, a majority of teenagers who like to wear brand-name clothes express themselves by what they wear on the outside. 	Although the quality of the materials and cuts of designer clothes often go beyond those of lower-priced versions of the same garment, the money that must be paid to buy designer clothes tends to far exceed their real cost. As a matter of fact, seventy-five percent of the often high purchase price is for the logo alone. However, as more and more people are starting to get at the cause of such high prices, they finally see the light that it is unwise to buy designer clothes, simply to prove their own worth. 	So, do you still have a good reason for choosing expensive brand-name products? 	¡XAdapted from ¡§Just a Brand Name, Not Your Name.¡¨
