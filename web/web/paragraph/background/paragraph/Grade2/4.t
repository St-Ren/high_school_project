Lesson Eleven   Les Mis?rables. °@°@Victor Hugo1°¶s novel Les Mis?rables2 captures1 people°¶s imaginations. This story of poverty2, revolution3, and romance3 strikes4 a chord4 in the hearts of people everywhere. But people no longer have to read the book to enjoy the story. Adapted from the 1,200-page novel, Les Mis?rables, or °ßLes Miz°® as the musical version5 is often called, captures hearts in the theater. °@°@ °@°@The story begins in 1815, when Jean Valjean5 leaves prison6. Though he tries, Valjean can get no work because of his criminal7 past. He finally steals some valuable8 silver from a kind bishop6. The police catch him and return him to the bishop°¶s house. To Valjean°¶s surprise, the bishop tells the police he gave Valjean the silver as a present. After the police leave, the bishop tells Valjean that he must use the silver to become an honest man. °@°@ °@°@As the story continues, Valjean does his best to be an honest man. He vows9 to raise a dying mother°¶s little girl as his own. He helps a group of students and the Paris poor as they fight against injustice10. He saves the man his °ßdaughter°® loves. All the while, a policeman is pursuing11 him because he broke his parole. The lyricist7 calls the emotional12 story a °ßpowerful river carrying you from beginning to end.°® °@°@ °@°@°ßLes Miz°® began as a French production. When the producer13 Cameron Mackintosh8 heard a recording9 of it in 1980, he immediately14 wanted to bring it to London. However, he realized that the musical needed to be reworked15. The French people know the story of Jean Valjean so well that the French musical began in the middle of the story. An English audience16 would need more background17. Mackintosh, the directors18, and the writers worked to translate19 the existing20 songs into English. They also added new ones to give the audience a clearer idea of the whole story. °@°@After reworking the musical, Mackintosh and the directors got the cast21 together in April 1985. They asked the actors22 and actresses23 to learn about the Paris of Victor Hugo. Everyone had to research something: church, schooling10, police, medical services, etc. This background really helped the cast understand the characters they were playing. °@°@The show opened on October 8, 1985, in London. The critics24 didn°¶t like it, but the audience loved it. They cried, clapped25, and cheered, and they told their friends to see the show. Today, people still tell their friends to see the show. It continues to play to delighted audiences in London. From London, the musical spread around the world. More than fifty million people have seen the show performed in thirty-four countries in twenty different languages. °@°@In London, hundreds of people have written to the director describing how they were moved and changed by the show. Many people wrote about personal problems that they overcame. They said the show gave them a feeling of optimism26 that made them stop their self-pity27. The show also inspired the casts to work together to raise money for good causes. No other play in the history of theater has raised so much money for charity11, particularly28 the homeless29. °@°@ °@°@Although not every country has experienced the revolutions and social problems of France, everyone can understand the kind of social injustice that Hugo writes about. The book and the musical tell the story of human suffering30, but give a message of hope. That message touches people everywhere. 
Body Language. °@°@Everyone uses body language. It°¶s one of the things we can°¶t help doing. In Japan, for example, you will often see people bowing as they talk on the phone°Xeven though the other person can°¶t see them doing so. Similarly1, it°¶s said of some Europeans that if you were to cut off their hands, they wouldn°¶t be able to communicate at all; to them, hand gestures2 are an essential part of their communication. °@°@ °@°@Often people say one thing with their words, but their body language expresses something completely different. This shows that they are either, at best, just trying to be polite or, at worst, lying. °@°@ °@°@Knowing how to read body language is a useful communication skill. It°¶s also important to know how to use body language to get your message across in a persuasive manner3. Different aspects4 of body language include proximity5 and a variety6 of hand gestures. Some of these aspects are standard7 around the world, while others vary from culture to culture. Proximity °@°@Have you ever heard of the diplomatic8 dance? It°¶s something that happens in international cities when people from different cultures come together at a party. As one person tries to get closer to talk, the other person, if from another culture, might try to move away. The result is a kind of dance as one person pursues and the other retreats around the room. °@°@ °@°@This dance has to do with proximity or how comfortable people feel standing next to each other. The furthest9 business people feel comfortable standing away from each other is in one of the most crowded countries in the world: Japan. However, in the Middle East1 it°¶s said that you should feel the breath of the other speaker on your face. These are some distances at which people feel comfortable standing next to each other: °@°@°E Japan: 90 centimeters °@°@°E United Kingdom2: 60 centimeters °@°@°E North America: 48 centimeters °@°@°E Europe: 35-40 centimeters °@°@°E Middle East: 20-30 centimeters Hand Gestures °@°@Hand gestures are among the most confusing10 aspects of body language because they vary greatly around the world. Differences in hand gestures have become less daunting11 in recent years with the popularity12 of international movies that take common gestures from one culture and introduce them to another. Someone who has seen a foreigner°¶s unusual gesture in a movie is less likely to be confused or offended by it when they see someone else doing it in person. °@°@ °@°@Try this quiz to see how much you know about international body language. 1.

When the Cat°¶s Away, the Mice Will Play. °@°@Cats are loved by people all over the world because of their grace1, beauty, and strong, independent2 personalities3. The ancient Egyptians1 worshipped4 cats as gods, and today in Africa, the lion is known as °ßking of the beasts.°® In the United States, cats are one of the most popular house pets, and many Americans love their cats so much that they think of them as another member of the family. No wonder there are many English expressions5 that use the word cat. °@°@ °@°@The American dream, for example, is to become a fat cat, a term for a wealthy6 and powerful7 person. But even those without a lot of money can still afford8 to take a cat nap, or a short rest, every now and then. However, it is not considered good to act like a cat°Xto cat around, playing and sleeping too much, and living an aimless9 or selfish10 life. °@°@ °@°@People have always admired11 cats for their athletic12 abilities and their sense of balance13, and also for their very quiet way of doing things. That°¶s why we use the term cat burglar to describe a talented thief, one who can quietly sneak14 away with something valuable without anyone noticing. We also use the expression the cat°¶s got your tongue to mean you cannot speak or don°¶t know what to say. Because cats are such expert predators in hunting and eating smaller animals, we often talk about a game of cat and mouse, which refers to any difficult challenge15 that requires strategy16 and skill, or also one in which a powerful person is teasing or acting cruelly towards someone weaker. °ßWhen the cat°¶s away, the mice will play°® is another common cat idiom. It means that when the teacher leaves the room, the students will become wild and crazy, or when a teenager°¶s parents are out of town, he or she will invite friends over for a big party. °@°@ °@°@Because cats are often running away from dogs, American children will tease a friend who is afraid of something by calling him or her a scaredy-cat2 or a fraidy-cat3. Another popular name used to tease someone is copycat4, used to describe a person who talks, dresses or acts just like someone else. Another cat expression can be used when your best friend tells you an important secret: you have to remember not to let the cat out of the bag, meaning not to tell anyone else. And be careful, because if you do tell your friend°¶s secret, the two of you could end up fighting like cats and dogs. °@°@ 
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄStarting a new high school life away from home is never easy, especially for the shy and awkward Bella Swan. Although many students befriended* her, it was not until she saw the Cullens that she found people who really interested her. From their pale, white skin to their mysterious aloofness*, everything about them was different. Bella was immediately attracted to the youngest brother, Edward, and couldn‚Äôt take her eyes off him. She soon met him in biology class, and, after a difficult beginning, they slowly began to talk. „ÄÄ„ÄÄTheir paths crossed again in the school parking lot. Bella was just about to get into her truck when suddenly, a van passing by lost control and skidded* right towards her at an alarming speed. Startled, she froze and was unable to react. But at the very last second, Edward miraculously appeared beside her and stopped the massive force from crushing them both with his bare hands. She was utterly stunned and confused. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAlthough thankful, Bella was determined to find out how Edward seemingly* defied* the laws of physics. It wasn‚Äôt just his superhuman strength and speed; he also had icy cold skin, and neither ate nor went out into the sunlight. She was so driven that she wasn‚Äôt even aware that thoughts of him began to occupy her mind every minute of the day. ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm not the hero? What if I‚Äôm the bad guy?‚Äù he had once said to her. But she would never believe that Edward was a bad guy. When she thought of him, his voice, his hypnotic* eyes, and his magnetic personality, she wanted nothing more than to be with him right then and there. So when he finally confirmed her suspicions and revealed that he was a vampire*, Bella wasn‚Äôt afraid. It didn‚Äôt matter that a part of Edward thirsted for her blood. She was completely in love with him and knew he felt the same way. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe two became inseparable. Both being different from the crowd‚Äî outsiders in a sense‚Äîthey knew that they shared something special, something extraordinary. Everything was going well until Edward‚Äôs family and Bella ran into another group of vampires. These vampires were not like the Cullens. They enjoyed killing humans. And when one of them, James, realized how far Edward and his family would go to protect Bella, his desire to hunt her intensified. He tricked her into leaving the Cullens and falling into his trap. When Bella realized what had happened, she was sure that this would be the end of her. In her futile* struggles to escape, her hand was bitten by James‚Äô poisonous vampire fangs*. Just before he could deliver the fatal blow, however, Edward heroically* came to her rescue and defeated the predator*. But to save her, he had to suck the venom* out of the wound without draining the rest of her blood‚Äîa desire almost impossible to control. Trembling and fighting back his instinct, he summoned all his will and determination and saved Bella without killing her. By the time Bella returned home, she had fully recovered. „ÄÄ„ÄÄLater that semester, Bella went to the school prom* with Edward. She couldn‚Äôt dance, so the prom was the last place she would go to. But with him by her side, she felt assured. She felt like she could do anything. In fact, for the first time in her life, she felt like she really belonged. The evening was perfect, and Bella was left with no doubt in her mind that Edward was the person she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. However, she didn‚Äôt want to grow old and be separated from him by death, so she asked him to change her into a vampire. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want this.‚Äù Edward refused, hoping that the girl he loved would be able to enjoy a normal human life. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs what you dream about, becoming a monster?‚Äù „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI dream about being with you, forever.‚Äù Bella replied. 
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn the 1s, Marshall McLuhan*, a well-known media scholar, wrote a book titled The Medium is the Massage. What he meant was that under the influence of the media we unconsciously relax, and tend to believe every message we receive without giving it a second thought. Now half a century has passed. The mass media* have further refined* their ability to penetrate deep into our minds and sell us things. „ÄÄ„ÄÄProduct placement*, the displaying of brand-name items as ‚Äúprops*‚Äù in TV shows, has become a very popular marketing* technique, one most of us are probably not aware of. When we see an actor eating a particular brand of cereal or using a certain laundry soap, we are likely to form a positive impression of the product unconsciously. Although more subtle than traditional commercials, product placement makes the brand or product more visible to consumers. If you take a close look, it is no exaggeration to say that most TV programs we watch today have brands ‚Äúplaced‚Äù in them. „ÄÄ„ÄÄOne reason for the rapid growth of placement marketing is that it has become easy for viewers to avoid traditional commercials. With devices like remote controls and DVR*, viewers can skip the commercials by fast-forwarding* or switching channels. When ads become part of the show, however, viewers have no escape. No wonder product companies are paying a lot of money to TV stations to place their products in scenes. This has resulted in the rise of an ever-growing placement industry, which is estimated to earn $ billion a year in the U.S. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIf you think that at least the news programs on major networks* are objective, think again. A coffee shop chain* is reported to have paid a huge sum just to show the news anchor* with a big cup of its coffee during the morning news. This has raised new questions about the shifting line between news and sales. People also wonder if there is a possibility that news networks might ‚Äúfilter*‚Äù or ‚Äúpowder‚Äù the actual news in favor of the companies sponsoring the anchor seat. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn addition to TV, the big screen has also become a highly competitive display window for a wide variety of luxury products. You must be familiar with movie scenes featuring charming actors and actresses dressed in fashionable costumes, driving fancy race cars, or drinking expensive whiskey*‚Äîwith the brand name prominently displayed. You may also have been attracted by the beautiful scenes where the films take you‚Äîa five-star hotel, or an exotic* island. You may not know that filmmakers often have these luxury ‚Äúprops‚Äù and settings provided for free. As a matter of fact, they get paid for incorporating* them into their films. Many famous producers even have the total cost of production paid off before the first movie ticket is sold. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAs more and more people become aware of this practice, some are calling for more controls. As one media scholar commented, ‚ÄúIt is inherently* deceptive if people don‚Äôt realize that ads are ads.‚Äù There can be legal as well as ethical problems in this kind of marketing strategy. Living in a world filled with messages from many media, we‚Äôd better remain alert to the secret force of the ‚Äúmassage.‚Äù 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄBlind from birth, I have never had the opportunity to see myself and have been completely dependent on the image I create in the eyes of the observer. „ÄÄ„ÄÄMany people seem to think that since I can‚Äôt see, I also cannot hear. Very often, people will converse with me at the top of their lungs, enunciating* each word very carefully. „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen I go to the airport and ask the ticket agent for assistance to the plane, he or she will invariably pick up the phone, call a ground hostess, and whisper: ‚ÄúHi, Jane, we‚Äôve got a seventy here.‚Äù I have concluded that the word blind is not used for one of two reasons: They either fear that if the dread word is spoken, the ticket agent‚Äôs retina* will immediately detach, or are reluctant to inform me of my condition of which I may not have been previously aware. „ÄÄ„ÄÄOthers believe that I can‚Äôt talk, either. Often when my wife and I go out to dinner, a waiter or waitress will ask my wife if ‚Äúhe would like a drink,‚Äù to which I respond that ‚Äúindeed he would.‚Äù „ÄÄ„ÄÄThis point was driven home to me while I was studying for a diploma in law degree at Oxford University* in England. During the year I became ill and was hospitalized. At my door sat an elderly woman. ‚ÄúWhat is his name?‚Äù the woman asked the orderly* who had been wheeling me. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù the orderly repeated to me. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúHarold Krents,‚Äù I replied. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúHarold Krents,‚Äù he repeated. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúWhen was he born?‚Äù „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúWhen were you born?‚Äù „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúNovember 5, 1,‚Äù I responded. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúNovember 5, 1,‚Äù the orderly intoned*. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThis procedure continued for approximately five minutes. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù I finally blurted out, ‚ÄúThis is ridiculous. I can‚Äôt see, but it‚Äôs got to have become pretty clear to both of you that I don‚Äôt need an interpreter. Lady, you could have just talked to me directly.‚Äù „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúHe says you could have just talked to him directly,‚Äù the orderly reported to the woman. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe toughest misconception of all is the view that because I can‚Äôt see, I can‚Äôt work. I was turned down by over forty law firms because of my blindness, even though I had a Harvard Law degree. „ÄÄ„ÄÄTo my delight, this view of limitation and exclusion* is beginning to change. On April 1, 1, the Department of Labor issued regulations that mandate* equal-employment opportunities for the handicapped. „ÄÄ„ÄÄI look forward to the day when employers view their handicapped workers as a little child did me years ago. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAt that time, I was playing basketball with my father in our backyard. My father would stand beneath the hoop*, shout, and I would shoot over his head at the basket attached to our garage. Our next-door neighbor, aged five, wandered over into our yard with a playmate. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs blind,‚Äù our neighbor whispered to her friend. Dad shot and missed; I did the same. ‚ÄúWhich one is blind?‚Äù whispered back the little friend. „ÄÄ„ÄÄI hope that in the future, when a plant manager comes upon a handicapped and a nonhandicapped person working together, his comment after watching them work will be, ‚ÄúWhich one is disabled?‚Äù 
The Cost of Gratefulness. 	When I was about thirteen, my father frequently took me on short outings on Saturdays. On the way home from these trips, we often stopped for ten-cent ice cream cones. I couldn°¶t be sure my father would stop at the ice cream store, but from the time we started heading home, I would hope and pray that he would. I knew we would either go straight for the ice cream store or turn and go home empty-handed.  °@°@He would ask, °ßWould you like an ice cream cone?°® and I would say, °ßThat sounds great, Dad!°® I°¶d always have chocolate and he°¶d have vanilla1. He would hand me twenty cents and I would run in to buy our cones. We°¶d eat them in the car. I loved my dad and I loved ice cream°Xso this was heaven. °@°@One fateful day we were heading home, and I was hoping and praying for the beautiful sound of his offer. Then it came, °ßWould you like an ice cream cone today?°® °@°@°ßThat sounds great, Dad!°® °@°@But then he said, °ßIt sounds good to me too, Son. How would you like to treat today?°® °@°@Twenty cents! My mind reeled. I could afford it, but saving money was important. Dad had often told me that. And when it came to my own money, ice cream just didn°¶t seem like a good thing to spend it on. °@°@Why didn°¶t it occur to me that this was a golden opportunity to give something back to my very generous father? Why didn°¶t I think that he had bought me at least fifty cream cones, and I had never bought him a single one? But all I could think was the idea of spending twenty cents! °@°@In a fit of selfish, miserly ingratitude, I said the awful words that have rung in my ears ever since: °ßWell, in that case, I guess I°¶ll pass. °@°@My father just said, °ßAll right, Son.°® °@°@But as we turned to head home, I realized how wrong I had been and begged him to turn back. °ßI°¶ll pay!°® I pleaded. °@°@But he just said, °ßThat°¶s OK. We don°¶t really need ice cream,°® and he wouldn°¶t listen to my pleading. We drove home. °@°@I felt awful about my selfishness and ungratefulness. He didn°¶t rub it in, though, or even act disappointed. °@°@I learned that generosity goes two ways and gratitude sometimes costs a little more than just °ßthank you.°® On that day gratefulness would have cost me twenty cents, and it would have been the best ice cream I°¶d ever had. °@°@I°¶ll tell you one more thing. We went on another trip the next week, and as we approached the crucial corner I said, °ßDad, would you like an ice cream cone today?

The Future Body Network.                                         °@°@Are you tired of cables that spread all over your desk and make your Coke tumble over onto your keyboard? If so, you may consider using devices that use technologies like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Neither of them sends data through cables. It sounds perfect, doesn°¶t it? But this is not the end of the story. 	Scientists are now trying to use the human body to do a similar job. They have come up with the idea of sending data over the small electric field4 on the surface of the skin. To do this, a transmitter could be built into your pocket or a portable device like an MP3 player. This transmitter would then use your skin°¶s electrical field to send data to a receiving device. Since this kind of transmission has a range of only twenty centimeters, the receiver would have to be close to some part of your body. 	By using this body network, you wouldn°¶t need a cable to link your MP3 player in your pocket to the headphones in your ears, or to send to your computer the pictures from a digital camera hanging around your neck. Moreover, you can exchange electronic cards with others by shaking hands, trade music files by dancing cheek to cheek, or swap phone numbers just by kissing.°@°@ 	Now, here comes a question. Why would anyone bother networking through their body when Wi-Fi and Bluetooth already exist? The answer lies in the fact that with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, it is hard to limit the signals only to your own use. In a busy place, you can never know who might steal your information. In contrast, body networking is safer. It is hard for other people to pick up signals sent over the surface of your skin since this body network only extends twenty centimeters from your body. Thus, no one else can easily pick up and interpret your signals. 	Moreover, the most important use of body networking in the future may well be communication within the body rather than just on its surface. Imagine having a number of small devices implanted under your skin and using them to control your own nervous system. In other words, imagine that you possess and control a powerful in-body computer. What do you think of this idea? Does it sound cool, like being a character in the movie RoboCop? Or would you prefer to be just a normal human being?                                             --by Eugene Oxford  
Learning to Keep Your Cool.      Have you ever panicked or blanked out during a test? Most students experience some level of anxiety not only during a test, but also before a test. Some experience mainly physical symptoms, such as headaches, upset stomach, nausea, restlessness, and sleep problems. Others experience more emotional symptoms, like crying easily, feeling irritable, or getting frustrated quickly. They are suffering from what is called test anxiety.      In fact, a little bit of stress is helpful. It makes students feel keyed up and helps them to perform better. However, test anxiety can make it difficult to concentrate because students may not have had enough sleep. Thus, such anxiety may increase the likelihood of forgetting and making careless errors on an exam. This anxiety can also affect exam performance by making it hard for students to prepare well for a test. Poor preparation may result from any of the following:      ? poor time management      ? failure to organize course information      ? poor study habits       If you suffer from test anxiety, you should know that there are ways to overcome it. Before a test, try to build up your confidence. View the test as an opportunity to show how much you°¶ve studied. Digest and organize the material thoroughly. Allow yourself plenty of time and avoid thinking you need to cram just before the big test. In addition, getting a good night°¶s sleep can sharpen the mind.      During the test, read the directions carefully and budget your test-taking time. If you go blank, skip that question and go on. When other students start handing in their papers, don°¶t panic. There°¶s no reward for being the first one done. If you find yourself tensing up and getting anxious, try to relax. Otherwise, you might not even be able to put down the answers you actually know. Try stretching as hard as you can. Tense the muscles in your arms and legs; then suddenly relax all of them. This will help relieve tension. But keep in mind that you don°¶t want to be too relaxed. Being totally relaxed is no better than being too tense. If you are so calm that you don°¶t care how you do on a test, you won°¶t do well.      Expect some anxiety. It°¶s a reminder that you want to do your best, and it gives you more energy and helps you to concentrate. Just keep your anxiety at a level that is manageable. Realize that anxiety can actually be a habit and that it takes practice to use it as a means to succeed. Once you start the test, stop worrying. Do your best. Above all, don°¶t forget to celebrate after the test. Be happy that you have overcome a big obstacle! °Xby Eveline Woolf 
Being On Time.      An office meeting will start at 10:00 a.m. Hans, a German colleague, is already waiting at 9:55. Michael, an American, arrives at 10 on the dot. In the next five minutes a few others hurry in. But trying everyone's patience is Raul, the visitor from Brazil. Not until 10:30 does he walk into the office, and he doesn't even think he's late.      How people perceive time varies around the world. Germans like arriving early. Americans plan to arrive just on time. Brazilians aren't bothered by being a half hour late. And many people don't even keep track of the exact time.      Even though cultural attitudes toward time differ greatly, all cultures can be put into one of two groups: time-oriented and event-oriented. Time-oriented cultures put more emphasis on schedules, while event-oriented cultures think that what happens is more important than when it happens.      The Western world, particularly North America and Western Europe, is strongly time-oriented. Events take place at specific, scheduled times. Appointments are kept to the minute, with perhaps a five-minute leeway. In time-oriented cultures, time is like a conveyor belt that carries boxes. Each box represents a segment of time. One must pack as much as possible into each box before it slips past. In other words, time must be "managed" well, or it may be "wasted."      In event-oriented cultures, meetings begin when everybody arrives and finish when all the business is done. Events are scheduled to begin "after dinner" or simply "tomorrow." This relaxed lifestyle is typical of people in Arab, African, Latin American, and Southeast Asian countries. There, time is like the sun, showing up again and again. Since time is unlimited, schedules are often put aside for even a minor reason, such as meeting someone on the street.      If travelers don't understand these different ideas about time, they will be troubled by unnecessary conflicts. For example, American students often quickly exchange "How are you?" and "Fine" when they rush to be punctual for classes. But event-oriented students see this exchange as impersonal. Before they can say anything more than "Fine," the American student has already hurried past them.      For people who believe "time is money," the slow pace of life in event-oriented lands can be frustrating. Since time-oriented people value productivity, they might view event-oriented people as lazy or inefficient. However, event-oriented people may feel offended when time-oriented people cut to the chase too quickly because event-oriented people prefer getting to know their associates before discussing the details of a business deal.      What can the world's travelers do to avoid these time-related conflicts? Follow this age-old rule: "When in Rome, do as the Romans do." 
Unit 11  Let°¶s Be °ßDiverse°®. 	It is said that if bees become extinct, humans will have no more than four years to live. Stunning as the prediction may seem, it is highly probable. Bees, which qualify as the best pollinators in nature, carry pollen from one plant to another during their daily search for food. Were it not for bees, most plants would not be able to be fertilized and reproduce, nor would humans be able to use these plants for food, clothing, medicine, and fuel. If bees became extinct, crop yields would fall. Next, food shortages would surely arise. It is no exaggeration to say that bees are vital to human survival. 	The bad news is that there has been a steep decline in the bee population since the 1970s. Human activity has destroyed the natural habitats of many animals and plants, one of which is the natural habitat of bees. Agricultural practices, especially the use of insecticides, are one of the contributing factors in the destruction. To solve this crisis, some people have suggested artificial pollination. It sounds feasible in some ways; however, little do they know that a worker bee can fly among at least 5,000 flowers a day, with more than ten thousand pollen grains attached to its body hair. So quickly do worker bees pollinate plants that science and technology alone can°¶t compare. 	What°¶s worse is that most people are not alert to the even bigger crisis behind the phenomenon of the declining bee population°Xthat is, a severe ecological imbalance. All species on Earth, including animals, plants, and microorganisms, have important roles to play. Various species, together with the environment they live in, form an ecosystem. The variety of life within a particular ecosystem, such as a rain forest, a desert, or even the entire Earth, is referred to as biodiversity. Healthy biodiversity can ensure a balanced ecosystem and the survival of all the species within. Nevertheless, over the centuries, humans have caused the Earth°¶s biodiversity to drop to such an extent that it can never be recovered. 	Why is it important to conserve biodiversity? One reason is that genetic diversity is closely related to biodiversity. The poorer the biodiversity is in an ecosystem, the smaller the gene pool will be. In other words, poor biodiversity will lead to low genetic diversity and reduce the biological fitness of a species, thus bringing about a greater chance of extinction. Unfortunately, humans have long gotten used to planting only one staple crop in an area, which causes the loss of local biodiversity. The Great Famine in Ireland in the 19th century is a classic example. Because of potato blight, the locals had a very bad harvest of the potato species that they had lived on. The famine took around one million Irish lives and forced another million to emigrate. Had the Irish introduced other potato species that were resistant to this disease, the disaster would have been much less grave. 	It is apparent that biodiversity is of great importance to all biological species. If the loss of biodiversity continues, humans will certainly suffer the consequences of it in the future. In the long term, trying to survive would be a difficult task for all of the species in the world, including humankind, not to mention the possibility of flourishing. Therefore, conserving the endangered species is not simply about saving beautiful plants and animals. It is actually about saving ourselves and our descendants alike. °–By Liu Kuan-miao.

Unit 11  They°¶re Back! 	Each year, an estimated ten thousand to one hundred thousand species die off. After that, they won°¶t be found in the wild, nor will they be seen at any zoo. They will join the countless other species that have gone extinct over the course of Earth°¶s history°Xand extinction means forever, or at least it used to . . . 	Scientists now think it highly possible to bring extinct species back from the grave. This doesn°¶t mean the plot of Jurassic Park is going to become a reality, though. Researchers need DNA to bring a species back from extinction. DNA is the chemical that contains the genetic code of organisms and carries the structure of a living thing. Dinosaurs, which disappeared sixty-five million years ago, have been gone too long for any of their DNA to remain in fossils. 	But there°¶s a very good chance that more recent species can be made to walk in the world again. Such animals could even include Ice Age animals like the woolly mammoth. In 2009, scientists recreated the Pyrenean ibex, which had become extinct about a decade earlier. The °ßnew°® animal didn°¶t survive long°Xit died only seven minutes after its birth. Yet, scientists are continuing to make every effort to improve this technology, and scientific advances should increase the success rate. In 2013, Australian scientists announced that they were on their way to bringing the gastric brooding frog, a native of eastern Australia which perished in the mid?1980s, back to life. 	Being able to bring species back doesn°¶t mean that we should do it. There may be many a benefit of reviving a species; however, we cannot accurately forecast what the results might be, nor can we deal with the possible disasters. Take passenger pigeons, for example. Living in flocks made up of billions of birds, they used to be one of the most common birds on the planet. Flocks of migrating passenger pigeons darkened the sky, and it sounded like thunder when they flapped their wings. This species vanished a century ago because of being hunted on a massive scale. If we make it possible for passenger pigeons to exist again, there is no knowing whether they will still be able to live in their old habitats. Will they crowd out any remaining species? Will their great consumption of seeds affect the growth of trees? 	Some people believe that humans are responsible for the extinction of certain animals, which obliges us to correct the situation. As environmentalist Stewart Brand once said, °ßHumans have made a huge hole in nature. We have the ability now to repair some of that damage.°® However, others consider it inappropriate to bring species back, since this weakens the support for traditional conservation: Why do we have to preserve a wildlife habitat or fight poachers, if we know we can just reverse our mistakes? 	As technology develops, extinction now may no longer be something that lasts forever. But whether it is right to make extinct species return is still a matter for debate. In order to avoid possible disasters of reviving extinct species, we would do well to remember the lesson of Jurassic Park: Proceed with caution°Xand leave the velociraptors alone. °XAdapted from °ßThey°¶re Back!°®
