Lesson Four   The Owl Who Was God. °@°@One of the oldest forms of literature, in almost every culture, is the fable1. Fables are short, simple stories that teach us lessons. These lessons, called morals2, are usually serious points about how to behave in the world. °@°@ °@°@This ancient form of writing has been used also by many modern writers. One of the best known of these is James Thurber1 (1894-1961). Like the writers of old, Thurber wrote simple stories that used animals as characters3. But Thurber°¶s stories always end in a very different tone4 than the usual fable, and their morals are much more cynical5. He makes us laugh and wince2 at the same time. The story below is a classic6 Thurber fable. °@°@ °@°@Once upon a starless midnight there was an owl3 who sat on the branch7 of an oak4 tree. Two ground moles5 tried to slip8 quietly by, unnoticed. °ßYou!°® said the owl. °ßWho?°® they quavered9, in fear10 and astonishment11, for they could not believe it was possible for anyone to see them in that thick darkness. °ßYou two!°® said the owl. The moles hurried away and told the other creatures12 of the field and forest that the owl was the greatest and wisest of all animals because he could see in the dark and because he could answer any question. I°¶ll see about that,°® said a secretary13 bird, and he called on the owl one night when it was again very dark. °ßHow many claws14 am I holding up?°® said the secretary bird. °ßTwo,°® said the owl, and that was right. °ßCan you give me another expression for °ßthat is to say°® or °•namely15°¶?°® asked the secretary bird. °ßTo wit,°® said the owl. °ßWhy does a lover call on his love?°® asked the secretary bird. °ßTo woo6,°® said the owl. °@°@ °@°@The secretary bird hastened16 back to the other creatures and reported17 that the owl was indeed the greatest and wisest animal in the world because he could see in the dark and because he could answer any question. °ßCan he see in the daytime, too?°® asked a red fox7. °ßYes,°® echoed18 a dormouse8 and a French poodle9. °ßCan he see in the daytime, too?°® All the other creatures laughed loudly at this silly question, and they set upon the red fox and his friends and drove them out of the region. Then they sent a messenger19 to the owl and asked him to be their leader. °@°@ °@°@When the owl appeared among the animals it was high noon and the sun was shining brightly. He walked very slowly, which gave him an appearance of great dignity20, and he peered21 about with large, staring eyes, which gave him an air of tremendous22 importance. °ßHe°¶s God!°® screamed a Plymouth Rock hen10. And the others took up the cry °ßHe°¶s God!°® So they followed him wherever he went and when he began to bump23 into things they began to bump into things, too. Finally he came to a concrete24 highway and he started up the middle of it and all the other creatures followed him. Presently25 a hawk11, who was acting as outrider12, observed26 a truck coming toward them at fifty miles an hour, and he reported to the secretary bird and the secretary bird reported to the owl. °ßThere°¶s danger ahead,°® said the secretary bird. °ßTo wit?°® said the owl. The secretary bird told him. °ßAren°¶t you afraid?°® he asked. °ßWho?°® said the owl calmly, for he could not see the truck. °ßHe°¶s God!°® cried all the creatures again, and they were still crying °ßHe°¶s God!°® when the truck hit them and ran them down. Some of the animals were merely27 injured28, but most of them, including the owl, were killed. °@°@ Moral: You can fool too many of the people too much of the time. 
Lesson Seven   An Unpunished1 Crime.      The first time I got caught stealing was when I was about eight years old. My mother, older brother, and I went shopping at a department store. While my mother and brother were looking at clothes, I went alone to the music department. I noticed2 a Michael Jackson cassette1 and, without really thinking, put it in my pocket. Then I went back to where my brother was, and we continued shopping.      Later, while we were driving home in the car, I decided to have a look at my new cassette. My brother saw it and asked me where I had gotten it. I was unable3 to answer, and so he immediately told my mother that I had stolen the cassette. As soon as my mother found out what I had done, she turned the car around and we went back to the department store. She dragged4 me into the store by my ear, and she made me return the cassette and apologize5. It was extremely embarrassing. And it didn°¶t end there. My mother told my father and he yelled at me furiously6 for what seemed like forever. For my punishment, I was grounded7 for the rest of the summer vacation (two whole weeks!). The experience made me very angry, but I did learn two things that day: one, when you do something wrong, be very careful not to get caught, and two, never trust8 your brother.      A few years later, in middle school, I made a new friend, Andy, who was a bad influence on me. Andy never studied and was always getting into trouble. I thought Andy was cool and I wanted to impress9 him. When I found out that he liked to shoplift10, I felt I had to join him to show that I wasn°¶t °ßchicken11.°® Every day after school, we would go to stores and steal candy, cassettes, poker2 cards, cigarettes12, and anything else that we could get our hands on. Andy liked to call it °ßshopping with a five-finger discount13.°®      One day, Andy and I were shoplifting in a convenience store, when suddenly a store clerk grabbed14 me. She had seen me putting a cassette in my pocket (I guess I had bad luck with cassettes). As soon as Andy saw that I was caught, he quickly left the store. I don°¶t blame15 him, as there was nothing he could do to help me. The police arrived and took me home in a police car. I was terrified16. The police officer talked with my mother and then left. I expected my mother to be furious, just as she had been before, and was waiting for the severe17 punishment that was sure to come. However, to my surprise, she just broke down and cried. For a long twenty minutes, my mother just wept. I pleaded18 with her to stop crying and I promised I would never steal again, but she wouldn°¶t stop. I had not only let her down, but I had broken her heart. I felt terrible19 seeing her so distressed20. She didn°¶t chew me out or punish me at all. She didn°¶t lecture21 me about stealing and she didn°¶t even tell my father.      After that day, I refused22 to steal again and I have never stolen anything since. Even today, if I think about stealing, I get that same sick feeling in my stomach and heart that I had the day my mother cried in front of me. Why that °ßnon-punishment°® was so much more effective23 than the °ßreal°® punishment I received when I was eight years old, I am not sure, but it makes me think about how I will punish and discipline24 my own children when they make bad decisions. I learned something else from that experience as well. When I told Andy that I wouldn°¶t shoplift again, he was OK with it and we continued to be friends just as before. I realized then that a true friend would never pressure25 you to do something that is bad and would accept26 you for who you are. 
Lesson Eight   Giant Pandas: an Endangered Species. 	Many animals today are facing extinction1. Tigers, whales, dolphins, elephants, marine2 turtles, and great apes1 are all in serious danger of extinction. Another very special animal that needs our protection is the giant panda2. Pandas are clearly an endangered species. There are only about 1,500 of them living in the wild today. All of them are found in China. 	The biggest problem that pandas face today is the loss of their natural habitat3. This loss is due mainly4 to deforestation5. Because of the rapid6 growth of population in the past century, large areas of natural forest have been cleared for agriculture7, timber3, and human habitation. As settlers8 push higher up the mountain slopes4, panda habitat inevitably9 disappears. 	Deforestation also threatens10 the pandas°¶ food supply. Pandas feed mainly on bamboo5, consuming11 up to 38 kilograms a day. Without enough forest area, the pandas will starve12. To make matters worse13, every 60 years or so the bamboo in a certain area may naturally bloom14 and die off. It will take several years for the new bamboo shoots6 to grow back. During this time, many wild pandas have to search for other areas to live in. However, deforestation now leaves them with nowhere else to go. 	Deforestation causes another serious problem. When people cut down trees, the forest is broken into small areas. In these areas, the pandas can only live in small groups. Within these small groups, it is difficult for them to find appropriate15 mates16. As a result, they are facing a greater risk of inbreeding17. The younger pandas may get sick more often and become less adaptable18 to changes in the environment. 	Another problem that pandas face is that young cubs7 are vulnerable19 and require a great deal of care. Although the panda mother may be large and heavy, her cub is very small, weighing only about 100 grams at birth. It has no fur20 and is blind for the first six weeks. During this time the mother does not leave the cub°¶s side. She has to spend much time licking21 the cub so that it will not have any smell that might attract predators22. 	Fortunately, measures23 are being taken to help the pandas. China and the World Wildlife Fund24 (WWF8) have been working together to develop reserves25 in the mountains of China and to start breeding programs in zoos around the world. Zoos are having some success in breeding pandas. For example, a panda named Hua Mei9, born in 1999 at the San Diego10 Zoo, is now living in China and is the mother of twins. 	It is helpful, of course, to breed pandas in zoos, but without their natural habitat, the pandas of the wild are sure to become extinct. The best thing we can do to help pandas is to preserve26 their habitat and take action to protect their lives. 
Unit 1 The Oscars.     Since 1927, the Academy1 of Motion2 Picture Arts and Sciences has given annual awards to people for their achievements in the movie industry. At the awards ceremony, called the Academy Awards or the Oscars, winners receive an Oscar¢wa small statue3 of a man holding a sword4. The man is standing on a reel1 of film with five spokes2 on it. Each point represents a branch of the Academy: actors, writers, directors5, producers, and technicians6. Any of these people can receive an Oscar.     No one really knows how the name Oscar originated. The most popular story is that an employee7 named Margaret Herrick3 saw the statue and said, °ßWhy, he looks just like my uncle Oscar.°® The name stuck, and it became official in 1939.     The Oscars ceremony has taken place in Hollywood every year since 1929, without exception. For many years, the ceremony was held in different hotels and theaters in Los Angeles. Finally, in 2001, the Kodak Theater4 was built in Hollywood as the permanent8 home for the ceremony. In 1929, the ceremony was only about fifteen minutes long, but today it takes several hours. In 2002, it lasted four hours and twenty-five minutes!     Thousands of people have received Oscars for their work in the movie industry. The person who has won the most Oscars is Walt Disney, with twenty-six. Three actors have received Oscars for playing roles9 with no words at all. Some people have refused10 Oscars, some have been awarded Oscars after they have died, and one received an Oscar for a movie twenty years after the movie first appeared.     The Oscars ceremony was shown for the first time on television in 1953. Ever since then, the audience has been growing. Today, more than a billion people around the world watch the Academy Awards every year. 
Love and Learn: Two Poems. °@°@The young and the old often have very different ideas about life. The young, we might say, are full of passion and ready to grasp1 the moment. The old, who have been made wiser by experience, are generally2 more cautious. °@°@ °@°@Perhaps this is most true when it comes to love. Oftentimes3, a young boy or girl will easily fall in love°Xand just as easily fall out of love! A more mature4 person, on the other hand, will know that true love takes time to grow, and that it rarely5 happens quickly. He or she also knows that love can bring not only happiness, but also sorrow and regret, and therefore, it should be approached with wariness6 and patience. °@°@ °@°@But how do older people know these things? Ah, it is only because they were once young also! They made their own mistakes in life and in love. As an old English proverb goes, °ßLive and learn°®°Xor, we might say, °ßLove and learn.°® However, does that mean everyone must make mistakes in order to become wiser and more mature? Or does it mean we should listen more closely to what advice our elders7 have to give us? The following two poems offer some words of wisdom about falling in love too young. °@°@ When I Was One-and-Twenty When I was one-and-twenty I heard a wise man say, °ßGive crowns1 and pounds and guineas2  But not your heart away;  Give pearls8 away and rubies3 But keep your fancy9 free.°® But I was one-and-twenty  No use to talk to me. When I was one-and-twenty  I heard him say again,  °ßThe heart out of the bosom10 Was never given in vain; °¶Tis paid with sighs a plenty And sold for endless11 rue4.°®  And I am two-and-twenty,  And oh, °¶tis true, °¶tis true. °@°@                   °Xby A. E. Housman (1859-1936) °@°@ Down by the Salley5 Gardens Down by the salley gardens my love and I did meet; She passed the salley gardens with little snow-white feet.  She bid12 me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree;  But I being young and foolish13, with her would not agree. In a field by the river my love and I did stand,  And on my leaning14 shoulder she laid her snow-white hand.  She bid me take life easy, as the grass grows on the weirs6;  But I was young and foolish, and now am full of tears.                      by William Butler Yeats (l865-1939) 
Who°¶s Out There? °@°@Do you believe there is life in outer space? A recent poll1 asked 900 American adults this question. Sixty percent answered yes. Over 40 percent of college graduates believed that flying saucers had visited the Earth. Close to 50 percent thought aliens were more intelligent2 than people on Earth. Eighty-five percent also said they thought aliens were friendly rather than hostile3. °@°@ °@°@Many people are convinced that aliens visit us regularly. They say that the American government4 knows this but is covering it up. In the last few years, thousands of Americans say they have been abducted by aliens. In fact, there is so much common knowledge about aliens that people can even describe what they look like: tall and slender5, with huge heads and almond-shaped1 eyes. There are models of aliens in the UFO (unidentified6 flying object) Museum and Research Center in Roswell1, New Mexico. °@°@ °@°@Roswell, New Mexico, is where it all started, over fifty years ago. In 1947, a farmer in the area found some strange, shiny7 material on the ground. He gave it to the sheriff3, who turned it over to the army8. The army sent out a press release4 about a °ßflying disk5.°® The local newspaper made a slight change and wrote a story about a °ßflying saucer°® in the Roswell region. The next day, the army changed the story and said that the material was from a weather balloon. Everyone forgot about the incident9 for many years. °@°@ °@°@Not until the 1980s was the Roswell incident mentioned again when several stories were published. Some people said that a spaceship6 had crashed on some farmland and that three to five alien bodies had been found. The bodies were being kept by the government in a secret place. The government denied10 the story, but many people still believed it was true. Seventy-one percent of the people polled said they believed the government knew more than they were telling people. °ßPeople would panic if they knew what really happened,°® said an observer. °@°@ °@°@Now Roswell has become a meeting place for people who believe in aliens. On the fiftieth anniversary11 of the rumors12 of a spaceship landing, more than 100,000 people gathered13 in the desert14 town, where the temperature can reach 110 degrees. They went out in the hot sun to look for the burn mark the spaceship left when it crashed against a rock. They paid $15 each for a viewing15. No one complained when they didn°¶t see a spaceship. They were just happy to be there. °@°@ °@°@Why all the interest in aliens? People are worried about problems on Earth and are suspicious16 of new technologies. Perhaps this leads them to believe there are beings17 who are more intelligent than we are. They hope these beings will save us and teach us better ways to live. °@°@ °@°@Of course, a lot of people are making money on these beliefs18. Motel owners in Roswell say a quarter of their visitors come to see the alien landing site19. Stores in Roswell sell everything from stuffed alien dolls to alien refrigerator magnets20. The media21 play up the belief as well. Alien-based movies and television shows feature government cover-ups and alien invasions22. And the fourth most popular talk show7 in America is about UFOs and aliens. °@°@ °@°@Skeptics23 say this is all a myth24. People want to believe we are not alone in the universe25, but no facts prove there is life anywhere else. Others disagree26. °ßWe just don°¶t know if aliens exist,°® says a researcher. °ßBut technology changes so quickly. Years ago people would never believe some of the things we can do today. Who knows what°¶s out there? We have to keep looking.°® 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt seems that counting is as easy as 1, 2, 3; however, it is not an inborn* ability but an acquired one. According to studies, we are only born to identify the patterns of groups of things. In fact, it took human beings thousands of years to learn how to count with numbers.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄBefore complicated counting systems were developed, people kept track of things through a tallying system*. If a shepherd had twenty sheep, he would put aside twenty stones‚Äîone for each sheep. Later, he would know if his flock was all there by matching the sheep to the stones. Without a doubt, this method was far from perfect. Aside from the risk of losing stones, what if there were lots of different groups of things to keep track of? Then those ‚Äúthings‚Äù could soon become unmanageable. Thankfully, around 3 B.C.,* abstract numbers* were invented in Mesopotamia. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAs the Mesopotamians began to engage in commercial activities regularly, they had to develop more accurate methods of counting. This motivated them to invent abstract numbers. These numbers make counting much faster because they always keep the same value. A set of symbols, called numerals*, was invented to represent the numbers. They were little wedge-shaped* patterns pressed into wet clay. Although the Mesopotamian numerals are seldom seen today, the base-* number system used by this ancient culture still exists now. For instance, we have 6 seconds in a minute, and 6 minutes in an hour. In geometry*, there are 3 degrees in a circle. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAfter Mesopotamia‚Äôs pioneering achievement, each civilization also developed its own number system. Egyptian* numerals were made up of little pictures, such as those of frogs and lotus* flowers. Roman numerals like I, V, X, etc., can still be found on the face of clocks, at the beginning of book chapters , and on some official documents. In China, there was a widely used set of written numerals, called Huama, before Arabic numerals were introduced.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄToday, of course, the most widely used numbers are based on the Hindu-Arabic* system; they use these familiar symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This base- system was first developed in India and introduced into Arab culture in the 9th century. Many people agree that 1 was chosen because human beings have 1 fingers and 1 toes; no doubt people long ago used their fingers to count up to 1‚Äîas we still sometimes do. Any number can be expressed by using different combinations of the 1 symbols. By 1, this system had become popular in Western Europe, and then it began to spread around the world.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄWe all count on numbers every day in countless numbers of ways‚Äîand we can be grateful that we don‚Äôt need stones to count our sheep anymore.  
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄPrincess Atalanta was a terrific athlete in ancient Greece*. Very skillful in masculine activities, the fair young lady was an excellent runner, archer*, and huntress. Proud of their vigorous and graceful princess, everyone in the country wondered what young man could ever be a match for her. But Atalanta did not want to give up her freedom. She consented to marry only if a man could outrun her in a race. Many men made the attempt but none could keep up with her. It soon became clear that no other human being could run as fast as Atalanta.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄOne young man, Hippomenes, watched in awe as Atalanta won one of her races. As she sped by, the maiden* seemed as swift and graceful as a falcon*. Her dark hair rippled over her white shoulders, the colored ribbons she wore fluttered, and her face grew rose-colored during the fierce race. Hippomenes fell deeply in love with Atalanta. Unable to outrun the beautiful huntress, however, he prayed to Aphrodite* for help.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄAphrodite, the goddess of love, heard Hippomenes and decided to help him. She appeared to the man and gave him three apples of pure gold. Aphrodite told him to use the golden apples in the race and then she vanished. „ÄÄ„ÄÄSo Hippomenes challenged Atalanta to a race. When Atalanta saw Hippomenes, she was struck by the beauty of his golden hair and the smoothness of his face. For a moment, she was not sure if she must outrun this young handsome man. Still, her desire for freedom tugged at her heart.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe race began and Atalanta immediately outpaced Hippomenes. The young man had to toss one of the golden apples right away. It landed near Atalanta‚Äôs feet and rolled to the side of the road. The apple diverted the princess‚Äôs attention. She stopped briefly to pick it up. Hippomenes took the opportunity and caught up with her. But Atalanta started running again and soon pulled ahead, so Hippomenes had to throw another apple. Once more, Atalanta stopped to get it, and Hippomenes got ahead. When Atalanta was back in the race, she picked up her pace and recovered the lead. Hippomenes hurled* the last apple further away from the road. Atalanta hesitated. The goal was now in sight, but the shining golden apple was too tempting a prize to pass up. She decided to run to the apple and grab it.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄNow Hippomenes had a bigger lead. He was almost approaching the finish line. His face was red with exhaustion and he was gasping for air. Atalanta, on the other hand, was running as swiftly as an arrow shooting toward its target. But it was too late. Hippomenes crossed the finish line first, and he was barely one step ahead. Atalanta lost the race. She had to keep her promise and marry Hippomenes. „ÄÄ„ÄÄFrom then on, the couple were seen racing in the countryside many times. But Hippomenes never won again. 
Mistakes That Worked: Post-it Notes and Slinky.      Call them accidents. Call them mistakes. If the truth were known, we might be amazed by the number of great inventions and discoveries that were accidental, unplanned and unintentional.       Post-it Notes      By now everyone knows what Post-it Notes are. They are those great little self-stick notepapers. Most people have Post-it Notes. Most people use them. Most people love them. But Post-it Notes were not a planned product. No one got the idea and then stayed up nights to invent it.            A man named Spencer Silver was working in the 3M research laboratories in 1970 trying to find a strong adhesive. Silver developed a new adhesive, but it was even weaker than those 3M already manufactured. It stuck to objects, but could easily be lifted off. It should have been super-strong, but it turned out to be super-weak instead.            No one knew what to do with the stuff, but Silver didn't discard it. Then one Sunday four years later, another 3M scientist named Arthur Fry was singing in his church's choir. He used markers to keep his place in the hymnal, but they kept falling out of the book. Remembering Silver's adhesive, Fry used some to coat his markers.            Success! With the weak adhesive, the markers stayed in place, yet lifted off without damaging the pages. In 1980, ten years after Silver developed the super-weak adhesive, 3M began distributing Post-it Notes nationwide. Today they are one of the most popular office products available.            In 1943, during World War II, an engineer in the United States Navy was on a new ship's trial run. As he worked, a torsion spring suddenly fell to the floor. The spring flip-flopped as the ingenious man watched.            The naval engineer's name was Richard James, and when he returned home, he remembered the spring and the interesting way it flip-flopped. James and his wife Betty perfected a long steel ribbon tightly coiled into a spiral. They began production in 1945.            The no-battery-required toy has fascinated three generations of children and adults alike. According to one estimate, more than two million Slinkys have been sold and the only change in the original design has been to crimp the ends as a safety measure. Betty James died in November 2008, aged 90, after having served as president of James Industries from 1960 to 1998. But the Slinky is still hopping, skipping, jumping, and bouncing across floors and down stairs all over America.            It is easy to fail and then abandon the whole idea. It's more difficult to fail and then recognize another use for the failure. As stated best by Bertolt Brecht in 1930, intelligence is not to make no mistakes, but to quickly see how to make them good.       --by Charlotte Foltz Jones, from Mistakes That Worked                         
Miyazaki's World of Fantasy.      Some call him Sensei of Anime and others the Japanese Walt Disney. He is Hayao Miyazaki, a great animator and director from Japan. For many years, he has taken his fans to his world of fantasy. He is fond of putting in his films such scenes as flying machines, strong females, and funny pigs.       Miyazaki was born into a wealthy family in Tokyo in 1941. His family grew prosperous by making parts for fighter aircraft during World War II. That was why he lived a life of ease as a little boy. It was during that time that Miyazaki began to draw airplanes and developed a fascination with flying, which consequently became a recurring theme in his films. In his third year in senior high, he saw the film Hakujaden, "the first-ever Japanese feature-length color anime," and his interest in animation started to grow. After college, he decided to be an animator.       In 1984, Miyazaki released Nausica? of the Valley of the Wind, based on his own manga (comic books). He then started his own animation company. Since then, he has directed and made many other films. All of them have been very popular. The Princess Mononoke, in particular, received the Japanese Academy Award for Best Film. It was also Japan's highest grossing film, but that record was later broken by another Miyazaki film, Spirited Away.      In Miyazaki's films, no one is truly good and no one is truly evil. For example, in The Princess Mononoke, Lady Eboshi is a rich woman who makes rifles. However, the reason she makes guns is because she wants to protect her village.       Miyazaki likes to make films for children and young people. His films always encourage them to look at life and the future optimistically. In Kiki's Delivery Service, Kiki, a young witch, travels to a new town with her cat. She runs into many hardships, but she finally learns how to gain confidence through difficulties. Miyazaki once said, "I wish there were such people, such things, and such a world."      After Miyazaki was awarded a Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the 2005 Venice International Film Festival, he said, "I want to create films that inspire children." In fact, adults also like Miyazaki's films very much, because he has created a world of fantasy where everyone can make their dreams take flight.  
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄThere was a time in my childhood when I believed that God was punishing2 my family by making us watch my only brother die. „ÄÄ„ÄÄMy brother Brad1 was a hemophiliac2. Even though Brad couldn‚Äôt be as active as other kids because of the hemophilia3, we had many common interests and spent a lot of time together. When the neighborhood kids played football3 or baseball, Brad would throw the ball, and the rest of us would do all the rough playing. Even though he appeared to be inferior4, he was really an inspiration to us. „ÄÄ„ÄÄHowever, when Brad was ten, as part of his hemophilia treatment, he received blood from someone who didn‚Äôt realize, or was too selfish5 to admit, that he or she was carrying HIV4, the AIDS5 virus6. Therefore, he became  infected7 with the terrible disease.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄI had just entered the sixth grade when my brother began to have serious symptoms and was diagnosed8 with AIDS. Our lives changed when Brad‚Äôs symptoms became apparent9. I couldn‚Äôt have friends over to spend the night.   Often, both my parents would need to be with  Brad during the times he was in the hospital.  It was difficult for me because sometimes they  were gone for a week at a time while I stayed  at a neighbor‚Äôs or an aunt‚Äôs house. I never  knew where I‚Äôd be from one day to the next.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThrough all the sadness and confusion, I grew bitter10 about not being able to lead a normal life. I began having problems in school. I became very angry and felt desperate11. I needed to blame12 someone, so I turned my blame toward13 God. „ÄÄ„ÄÄEventually14, the AIDS virus caused damage to Brad‚Äôs brain15. He became like a very young child again. He wanted us to read children‚Äôs books to him. He wanted me to help him color. I felt as if I had lost my brother while he was still alive16. „ÄÄ„ÄÄTwo weeks before his eighteenth birthday, Brad died. Since his passing, I‚Äôve searched for some reason for his life and death. Although there may not be a complete answer to my question, I am sincere17 in my belief that there was a purpose18.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄBrad was a person who always fought for what he believed in. He never gave up, and he never gave in to his hemophilia. He would play basketball with the heart of Larry Bird6, but the body of a hemophiliac. Those who watched him play for his elementary school team would see him limping19 up and down the court, trying his hardest. „ÄÄ„ÄÄOut of respect for his memory, we have not given up. My family and I have taken part in helping to make a difference in the way that people with hemophilia and AIDS are treated. We have been interviewed on television. We have been twice to Washington, D.C7., our nation‚Äôs capital20, fighting for a law to be passed by Congress21.

°@°@To forgive1 is divine2, according to Alexander Pope1, but it is hardly3 easy. How do you forgive a driver that runs into someone and then drives away, a bully4 who makes your life miserable, or a cheating boyfriend or girlfriend? You might have had thoughts like, °ßI can never forgive him for what he did to me.°® All of us are challenged to forgive on a regular basis5. Most of us know we °ßshould°® forgive, but studies show that forgiveness  is important for more than just moral6 reasons. It can also improve6 our physical and emotional health.  Why Should I Forgive?  °@°@Studies show that forgiveness reduces anger, nervousness8, and stress. It also leads to feelings of hope, compassion9, and self-confidence. Forgiveness has even been shown to help cancer10 patients live longer!   °@°@Refusing to forgive, on the other hand, is not healthy. It can increase your risk11 of developing heart diseases, high blood pressure, and depression12.  What Is True Forgiveness?  °@°@Forgiveness is letting go of feelings of hurt or anger. Forgiveness does not necessarily mean forgetting. If a friend reveals your secrets to someone else, forgive him and tell yourself: °ßHe is a good friend in other ways, but keeping secrets is currently13 not one of his attributes14.°®  Why Is It So Hard to Forgive?  °@°@Most people believe they should forgive, but find it difficult. One of the most common reasons is that people don°¶t want to let the offender15 off the hook16. What they want is justice17. However, not forgiving hurts you far more than it hurts the offender.  °@°@People often think forgiveness means they should act as if no wrongdoing has ever happened. But this is not right. If someone has broken your trust, it may be wise not to trust him or her again.  Keys to Forgiveness.  °@°@Forgiveness is sometimes challenging, but it is possible. Remember that forgiveness is not a feeling but a choice. Here are ways to help you let go of your resentment2 and truly forgive:  °@°@Think about it. Trying to forget the offense15 without dealing with it won°¶t make it go away. Instead, try to analyze18 exactly what is bothering19 you and why.  °@°@Write a letter to the person who hurt you. Write exactly what is bothering you. Then tear up the letter and throw it away. You will feel better, even if the offender never sees the letter.  °@°@Forgive the little things. Daily troubles¢wunpleasant classmates, nasty20 bus drivers, disrespectful21 children¢wcan cause more stress than big offenses. Forgiving small things frees you up to work on the big offenses. °@°@Empathize22. Try to understand why the offender did what he or she did. You could even write a letter to yourself, pretending23 to be the offender, and explain why you committed24 the offense.  °@°@Give yourself time. Your hurt feelings won°¶t heal25 quickly, especially if the offense was serious. Don°¶t blame yourself if you can°¶t move on right away.  °@°@Replace the bad with the good. To really forgive, you need to replace negative emotions with positive ones. Work to replace hurt and anger with love.  °@°@Choose forgiveness, and promise yourself not to indulge26 in unforgiving thoughts again. Write a note27 to yourself, with today°¶s date on it, stating whom you have forgiven and for what offense. °@°@Are you having a difficult time forgiving someone right now? Try these suggestions, and begin letting go of those hurt feelings. Enjoy the freedom and improved health that forgiveness brings.  	
°@°@Coming home from school, Jack sensed  something was odd2. His mother was sitting  contentedly3 in the living room reading a  magazine. She was always in the kitchen when  he got home.  °@°@°ßHi, Mom,°® he said. °ßWhat can I have for a snack?°®  °@°@°ßI don°¶t know,°® his mother answered.  °@°@Jack was surprised by her reply. She always had a snack that he liked waiting for him. He grabbed some spoiled4 potato chips, but soon regretted5 it.  °@°@°ßAre you sick or something, Mom?°® he called from the kitchen.  °@°@°ßNo, why?°® she asked.  °@°@°ßOh, you just seem kind of different,°® Jack answered. °@°@Soon, his sister, Martha, arrived. She was surprised to see her mother in the living room, too. °ßAre you ill, Mom?°® she asked on her way to the bedroom. °@°ßNo,°® her mother answered. °ßI°¶m just reading a very good story about°X°®   °@°@°ßMother!°® Martha yelled6 from the bedroom. °ßWhere°¶s my dress for tonight?°®  °@°@°ßMartha, you interrupted7 me. Your dress is in the ironing12 basket.°®  °@°@Martha frantically8 went through the basket of clothes that needed to be pressed9. She looked over at Jack, who was still searching for something to eat. °@°@°ßWhat°¶s the matter with Mom?°® she whispered10.  °@°@°ßI don°¶t know,°® Jack replied.  °@°@Martha set up the ironing board, plugged11 in the iron12, and began to iron12. She was really outraged13 because normally her mother would have done it for her. °@°@Then Dad came home. They could hear him talking to their mother in the living room.  °@°@Soon Dad came out into the kitchen, too. °ßWell, it seems as if your mother is taking the night off,°® he said. °ßI suppose14 we can all pitch15 in and make dinner tonight.°® °@Jack and Martha complained and whined16. But Dad said, °ßWell, if anybody wants dinner, they°¶d better get busy.°®  °@°@°ßDad, do you think there°¶s something wrong with Mom?°® Jack asked as they tried to cook something for dinner.  °@°@°ßI guess she°¶s just tired, Jack,°® he answered. °ßWe°¶ll just try to help out for a few days.°®  °@°@Then they looked over at the stove17. The soup was overflowing18 the pot19. When they finished cooking, the kitchen was a mess.  °@°@After dinner Mom cleared20 the table and then went in to watch television.  °@°@The next morning Jack reached into his socks drawer21. There weren°¶t any. Because his mother had already gone to work, he had to get a pair out of the dirty clothes basket. °@°@Later at school, Jack told his friend Steve about the bizarre22 way his mother was acting. °@°@°ßWell, that°¶s peculiar23,°® Steve said. °ßAren°¶t mothers supposed to do household24 chores25?°®  When Jack and Martha got home that afternoon, they found that things were just the same; they decided to speak with their aunt, Grace.  °@°@After they told her what happened, Aunt Grace said, °ßBut she has worked all day, so you can°¶t say she°¶s not doing anything.°®  °@°@°ßSurely you°¶re old enough to do something to help out around the house. Why should she carry the whole burden26?°®  °@°@°ßBut she does things better,°® Jack answered.  °@°@Aunt Grace was smiling by then. Martha thought that she knew more than she was letting on. °@°@Three days later, things were still the same. Jack and Martha decided to talk to Dad. Later, they went in to see their mother.  °@°@°ßHoney, we°¶re so worried about you that we decided to come and see what is wrong,°® Dad said.  °@°@°ßIs that because there°¶s no food in the kitchen and all the clothes are dirty?°® she asked.  °@°@°ßYou°¶ve never ac°ßWell, it°¶s very simple,°® Mother  said. °ßI work, your father works, and you  both go to school. We all have our jobs.  But when we get home, something happens.°®  °@°@°ßWhat happens?°® Jack asked.  °@°@°ßSuddenly I am the only one doing any work. Jack, you get a snack that I prepare. Then you go out to shoot27 baskets. Martha, you spend most of your time on the phone. Your father cuts the lawn on Saturday, and that°¶s about it.°®  °@°@°ßBut, Mom, we thought you liked to take care of us,°® Martha whined.  °@°@°ßI did when you were little. But now you°¶re grown up,°® Mother said. °ßIt°¶s time that things changed.°®  °@°@°ßBut that°¶s the way everybody lives,°® Jack said.  °@°@°ßYou never asked what I really like to do,°® Mother said. °ßI am part of the family, too.°®  °@°@Dad, Jack, and Martha all looked at one another. Things had been good the way they were. But now.... 
 °@°@Imagine smelling flowers, but never seeing colorful2 blossoms3. Imagine hearing rain, but never seeing clouds. Imagine a world in which danger, friends, and joy arrive without being able to see them. Although this may sound like another world to you, it is the world to many. It is how the world is °ßseen°® by blind people.  °@°@Taiwan°¶s estimated4 50,000 blind people face special challenges. Crowded streets, uneven sidewalks, and signs that hang5 low make getting around difficult. When shopping and traveling, they must trust the honesty of shopkeepers and taxi drivers. For some, the challenges are so great that they rarely leave home without a sighted1 person guiding6 them. °@°@At home, however, most blind people are able to live independently. They manage their own apartments without anyone looking after them. Of course, some things are a bit different. Appliance switches7 are labeled8 with Braille so that the blind can read them by touch. These labels8 allow the blind to use the appliances safely. Household items9 are stored in specific places so that sightless people can easily find them. Special labels on shirts and pants help the blind match the clothes they want to wear according to color.  °@°@There are many resources available for blind and visually-impaired people today. Special schools and associations help them gain education and independence. The Taipei Municipal10 Chiming School3 offers classes for sightless students aged 6 to 18. They study the same subjects as any other student in Taiwan. The Eden Welfare11 Foundation4 helps blind people with life skills12. The foundation provides job training and especially reaches out to those who have gone blind as adults. °@°@Moreover, the Taipei Association for the Blind5 works to improve life for the blind. The association works with the government on their behalf13 to secure their rights. It helps blind people get insurance14 and tries to get laws15 passed to protect them. The Huikuang Guide6 Dog Center6, founded in 1992, trains guide dogs for the blind. Its first guide dog, Aggie7, a Labrador Retriever8, helped raise the awareness in Taiwan of the difficulties blind people are confronted16 with.  °@°@One of the biggest challenges the sightless face is earning17 a living. There are not enough social welfare programs in Taiwan to help them. In the past, nearly all of Taiwan°¶s working blind gave massages9. Many of the blind still work in this traditional field18, but today, with the help of technology and caring teachers at schools like Eden, new opportunities are widespread19. Blind people are learning computer skills, developing their musical20 talents, and studying sound engineering21. They train to work as social workers and telephone operators22. Some develop special sensitivity23 in their other senses and become skilled wine and tea tasters.  °@°@Some sighted people are afraid of the blind. When confronted with a blind person, they feel awkward24. They avoid25 blind people because they don°¶t want to embarrass26 themselves. But blind people are no different from anyone else. They enjoy the same pastimes27 as others. They like listening to music, learning foreign languages, playing games, making crafts28 and even going to movies. But unlike most people in Taiwan, the blind must rely on the sound track instead of subtitles10 because they cannot see.  °@°@Although those with and without sight walk down the same streets, they live in two worlds, facing different challenges. The challenge for those with sight is to understand the difficulties, problems and abilities of the blind, and to give what blind people want most°Xfriendship. On the other hand, the challenge for sightless people is to believe in themselves and to realize that they can do what those with sight do. 
Unit 1  Putting Things Off. 	It°¶s late at night, and it°¶s time that I did my homework. My eyelids droop as I see the English assignment before me: Write an introductory paragraph for an essay on one of the five selected topics. I give some thought to the topics, but soon I find my eyes as well as my mind wandering to the mosquito bites on my leg. Next, I notice a stain on the shirt I am wearing. Then, I absently gaze at the clock. Suddenly, I am pulled back to reality as I realize that in a few hours I will be sitting in English class, and I haven°¶t even started on my paragraph yet. 	This is a classic situation for me. I have managed to put off writing this paragraph all afternoon, just as I manage to put off nearly all of my assignments for hours, days, and even weeks. Therefore, I am always in trouble when time runs out. My English teacher once quoted Henry David Thoreau°¶s words, °ßThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.°® Thoreau was right. Because of my procrastination, I have wasted a great amount of valuable time, and I find myself always one step behind in life. 	The results of my procrastination can be summed up in the famous saying, °ßProcrastination is the thief of time.°® I spend more time thinking up weak excuses for why I can°¶t do an assignment now than I ever spend on the actual assignment. I admit that there is room for improvement in the ways I have handled my assignments. Sometimes, for example, I might call my friend for the eleventh time that day, or I might even watch a television show meant for a four-year-old. Procrastination also causes me to waste time when I finally get down to the task I have been avoiding. The simplest task takes up extreme proportions of my mind because of the panic I feel for having put it off for so long. I become an irrational, dull thinker when I am rushed, and this makes me very slow in doing any task. However, the clock ticks on; it never stops for procrastinators like me. 	Furthermore, procrastination keeps me one step behind in life and at school as I try to catch up on what I should have already done. While most students diligently do their homework for that day, I diligently do my homework from the night before, or even from a week earlier. Because I can never seem to do a task when it is assigned, I never get the satisfaction from getting things done on time or being on top of everything. Rather, I always end up feeling that I am at the bottom of a pit, trying to climb out?one late assignment at a time. However, since I am always behind, catching up on my work is almost the same as trying to walk up a downward-moving escalator?very difficult and nearly impossible. Because of my procrastination, I am never free to live in the present. Instead, I always find myself trapped in unfinished business from the past. 	Thus, procrastination continues to rob me of time. My life is continually interrupted by spurts of anxiety and desperation as one deadline after another flies by. I have yet to grasp the concepts of organization and promptness. I hope that I will grasp them soon. Otherwise, I will be doomed to a life in the procrastinator°¶s prison that I have built for myself. ?Adapted from °ßPut It Off°® by Melia James.
Unit 2  Traffic Lights for Food. 	Recent studies have shown that being obese can pose a serious threat to our health. Obesity may lead to heart disease, diabetes, various types of cancer, and other disturbing health problems. To prevent any of these illnesses, it is vital that we control our weight. Exercise, without a doubt, is a good way to keep in shape. Calculating our BMI is another way to roughly determine whether we are maintaining our ideal weight or not. However, no matter what method we apply, we should first and foremost watch our diet. 	Our diet matters because what we eat has a lot to do with our weight and can directly affect our health. Thus, it is critical that we keep off any foods that are potentially damaging to our health. Many of us sometimes absorb excessive numbers of certain nutrients, such as fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt, and we can risk our health unknowingly. Therefore, the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom has come up with an idea called traffic light labeling. This system labels potentially risky nutrients with something we are familiar with: the lights at the intersection that tell both drivers and pedestrians when to go, to be cautious, or to stop. 	Traffic light labeling is easy to understand. Green, amber, and red respectively represent low, medium, and high amounts of fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt in one serving. Basically, the more green lights we see on a package of food, the healthier that food is. Red lights warn consumers that the food product should only be eaten from time to time or in small amounts. The middle of the two extremes is amber. Amber lights mean that the amount of fat, saturated fat, sugar, or salt that the food contains is not too high. However, the color also implies that the food is not °ßlow°® in those nutrients. This is something that the consumers should be aware of, too. 	This system has several advantages. One is that consumers can know if the food they are buying might possibly cause obesity-related diseases at a glance because the symbols that this system uses are instantly recognizable, even to children. Furthermore, it can be universally applied without worries about the language barrier. Currently, aside from the U.K., Germany and Sweden have introduced this system. 	Nevertheless, there is opposition to this idea. People in the food industry complain that this approach to food labeling is too simplistic. To them, giving exact figures to indicate nutrition facts for one serving is preferable. Advocates of traffic light labels for food counter this argument by saying that being simple is the virtue of this system. It makes finding information about food easy and obvious, lest consumers ignore the information just because reading nutrition facts takes time. 	In spite of the fact that not everyone supports traffic light labeling, this system does convey some important messages: People should make better food choices, and healthy products should be encouraged. There are times when we are not sure if the food we buy might do harm to our health. With traffic light labels on the package of a food product, we can pause for thought, consider what we should choose, and then decide which items we should put in our shopping baskets. After all, we are what we eat. °XBy Joseph E. Schier
Unit 4  The Magic Bean. 	Centuries ago, a brilliant Muslim physician whose name was Omar devoted himself to treating patients. All was well until a strange disease became an epidemic among the inhabitants of Mocha. The beautiful princess of Mocha also fell ill, and her health declined rather rapidly. Desperate with worry, the king summoned Omar to save his daughter. 	Omar hurried to the palace and was led to the princess°¶s chamber. °ßPlease save her life at all costs,°® the king implored. With a heart of gold, Omar nodded and began to treat the princess for this life-threatening disease. He stayed at her side all day and through the night. 	To everyone°¶s joy and relief, the princess quickly recovered from the illness the next morning. At first, the king was pleased with his daughter°¶s miraculous recovery. However, it was considered improper for a man to have stayed in the princess°¶s chamber throughout the night. As rumors about Omar began to go around, the king raged at the physician, °ßHad you not saved my daughter°¶s life, I would have executed you. From now on, you will be exiled from my kingdom for good.°® 	Omar, obeying the king°¶s order, left Mocha with bitter disappointment and embarked on a journey to a place he had never been to. There, he lived a life of a tramp and wandered the wilderness. One day, Omar was unable to find any food. Hungry and exhausted, he collapsed under a tree. °ßWill I starve to death today?°® he asked himself. 	Then, something caught his eye°Xa weak bird was eating some beans. To Omar°¶s astonishment, the bird soon looked energetic and began to chirp loudly. Out of curiosity, Omar collected some of the beans, boiled them to make a thick, sticky liquid, and then drank it. Within minutes, his energy was restored. The experience was so encouraging that he decided to use the magic bean as a type of medicine. 	As time passed, Omar still wandered alone, remaining exiled and forgotten. Only when another epidemic hit Mocha did his name occur to the people again. This time, another strange disease, which caused the body to throb and itch, was quickly spreading. The people of Mocha, in their suffering, recalled Omar°¶s good deeds and his extraordinary medical skill. Seeking out Omar was their last hope. When they finally found him, he had them drink the liquid made from this magic bean. Miraculously, all of the sick people who consumed the drink recovered from the disease. 	When the king heard about how Omar had helped his people, he regretted his decision to force the great physician to leave his land. Therefore, he sent word that Omar was no longer in exile. Amid cheers and applause, Omar returned to Mocha as a hero. 	This is how the magic bean, or the coffee bean as we call it today, is said to have been discovered. Today, this bean is used to make one of the world°¶s most popular drinks. As for Omar, he is revered as a saint by coffee growers and coffee shop owners near Mocha. °XBy Jules Crowell and Jason Grenier
Unit 5  The Journey Ahead. 	I was twenty-five when I was arrested for stealing a loaf of bread to feed my starving family. For that petty crime, I spent nineteen years in prison. 	When I was released from prison, I was a bitter man. I walked for miles, trying to find an inn to rest in. By the time I arrived at the town of Digne, the sun had already set, and I felt hungry and suffered from fatigue. 	When I was seeking accommodation for the night at an inn, the owner of the inn didn°¶t seem to like my appearance. He sent a boy to the police station to make inquiries about me. When the boy returned, he handed the owner a note. From the note, the owner learned that my name was Jean Valjean and that I was an ex-convict. As a result, he refused to offer me a room. 	Soon, everyone in Digne knew my identity. Consequently, no one wanted to reach out to me, and even a glass of water was too much for me to ask for. Cold and starving, I was left to shiver in the dark. 	Fortunately, the bishop of Digne, a very generous man, took pity on me and welcomed me with open arms. After hearing my story, he didn°¶t drive me out of his home as most others had done. Instead, he invited me to stay and dine with him. 	No one had ever been so nice to me. I should have been grateful to the bishop for his great kindness, yet I was deeply disturbed. That night, though I was lucky enough to sleep in bed for the first time in nineteen years, I couldn°¶t fall asleep. I kept thinking about the silverware and the candlesticks on the bishop°¶s dinner table. Then I got up, stole the silverware, and slipped away. However, I didn°¶t get far. By the time it was dawn, the police had caught me and taken me back to the bishop. 	°ßI°¶m delighted to see you again!°® the bishop spoke to me before I had a chance to say anything. °ßYou forgot to take the candlesticks.°® 	I was stunned by his words°–he had not only forgiven me for my crime but also wanted me to have his only treasured possession. 	After the police left, the bishop said, °ßI have bought your soul for God. Promise me you will use the money from these things wisely and become an honest man.°® 	I left the bishop°¶s house and wandered around the countryside. My thoughts were on my dreadful days in prison and on my wasted life. I was upset and angry. As I brooded over my misery, a boy turned up. He was walking toward me, flipping a coin. Then, the boy accidentally dropped his franc just as he passed by. As soon as I saw the coin, I stepped on it and refused to move. 	°ß Monsieur, my franc!°® cried the boy. 	I yelled at him, and he quickly ran away with a look of terror on his face. Later when I moved my foot, as though having woken from a nightmare, I realized what I had done: I had stolen from a child simply out of habit! The bishop°¶s words flashed through my mind. With flames of regret burning deep inside of me, I couldn°¶t help but weep and pray for forgiveness. I eagerly searched everywhere for the boy, but my efforts were in vain. Though I could not return the franc and put things right, my anger and bitterness had somehow vanished. The bishop°¶s love had allowed me to cast out my hatred for the world. 	From that moment on, I was truly free. I, Jean Valjean, was a changed man, a man who has never committed another crime. °–Adapted from Les Mis?rables by Victor Hugo
Unit 7 The Taj Mahal: A Teardrop of Love. 	There are a million ways to express deep affection for our loved ones. To Shah Jahan, an emperor in ancient India, building an incomparable tomb was how he memorialized his love. Finished more than three hundred years ago, this tomb remains one of the most impressive and glorious wonders of the world to date. It is known as the Taj Mahal. 	In fact, behind this grand structure is a touching story. Legend has it that Shah Jahan had numerous wives. Among them, Mumtaz Mahal was his favorite. He felt extremely depressed after she passed away while giving birth. Therefore, he recruited twenty-thousand workers to construct a luxurious tomb by the river Yamuna in memory of her. Building materials and valuable treasures were brought in from every part of the world. The emperor was particular about every detail, so it took twenty-two years to complete the construction. Before long, however, the emperor was usurped by his own son and imprisoned in the Agra Fort on the other bank of Yamuna. From across the river, he gazed day and night at this masterpiece built for the love of his life until his death. 	Though centuries passed, the Taj Mahal still stands there today, receiving admiration from people around the world. Such is its beauty that almost everyone is fascinated by it, including world-famous literary masters. Tagore called it °ßa teardrop of love upon the cheek of time°® and wrote the following words in praise of its lasting beauty: °ßThough empires crumble to dust, and centuries are lost in shadows, the marble still sighs to the stars.°® As Salman Rushdie stood amid the crowds of people admiring this great construction, he admitted his incapability of describing it. To him, the Taj Mahal is °ßa lovely thing, perhaps the loveliest of things.°® 	Observed from the back or from the side, the Taj Mahal is perfect. The magic lies in its white marble dome, which reflects the sunlight and the moonlight. Its color, as a result, changes at different times of a day. Bathed in the light of the setting sun, it carries a glimmer of gold. In the moonlight, it shines brightly when the precious stones reflect the moonlight spilling upon the terrace. When the sun rises the next morning, a pink flush appears instead. Its countenance is also reflected in the water mirror that sits right in front of it, with sunlight and clouds adoring it each day. 	Another architectural achievement of the Taj Mahal is its remarkable feminine lines. Most great architectural structures in the world inspire awe with a certain masculine quality°Xaggressiveness, arrogance, or pomposity. In contrast, the gentle yet rich and full contours°Xwhite, elegant, and tender make the Taj Mahal one of the very few exceptions. Aside from this, no other famous building on earth might be as accessible as it. There is no need to make a difficult journey to see it. With no mountains to scale and no rivers to cross, tourists can experience the Taj Mahal without any difficulty. 	As one of the most amazing wonders in the world, the Taj Mahal is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Over the years, it has sat in Agra and symbolized the emperor°¶s undying passion for his wife. In the future, this story will still touch people°¶s hearts, and the beauty of the Taj Mahal will always stick in their minds. °XOriginally written in Chinese by Lily Hsueh.
