Lesson Ten   It°¶s a New World Record! °@°@The name Sir Hugh Beaver1 may not mean much to most people, but his brainchild1, the Guinness World Records2, is known around the world. Here is how it all started: Sir Hugh was the managing director of the Guinness Brewery3. One day in 1951, he was hunting with some friends in Southern Ireland4. He shot at a kind of bird called the golden plover5, but he missed. Sir Hugh said that, in his opinion, the golden plover was the fastest flying game bird6 in all of Europe. Some of the people in his party2 disagreed. They said that the fastest game bird was another type of bird, the grouse1. Sir Hugh decided to check the facts. He and his friends searched through many reference3 books in the library, but they couldn°¶t find any information about the fastest bird°Xor the fastest anything, or the biggest, or the most expensive, or the oldest, and so on. °@°@ °@°@Sir Hugh had a brilliant4 idea. He realized that, every day, there were hundreds of arguments5 similar to the one that he had had with his friends. He decided that a thorough6, reliable guide to records was needed. °@°@ °@°@Several years later, in September 1954, Sir Hugh approached Norris8 and Ross McWhirter9. These twin7 brothers operated a fact-finding agency8. Sir Hugh asked them to collect and publish a guide to records in as many fields as possible. The McWhirter brothers opened a Guinness Records office in London, and after a year of hard work, the first slim volume9 was published in the U.K. By the end of the year, the book had climbed to the top of the British bestseller10 list. In 1956, the Guinness Company published the record book in the United States. It was an instant11 success there, too. Updated12 every year, the book of Guinness World Records has sold more than ninety million copies in seventy-seven different countries and in thirty-seven languages. In fact, the book holds a record of its own: it has sold more copies than any other book except the Bible10 and the Koran11. °@°@ °@°@Guinness World Records has been called the world°¶s most readable reference book. The records are divided into thirteen categories13. Some people use the book to settle arguments about scientific facts; others use it to resolve14 debates15 about sports. Most people, though, enjoy looking through the book for wacky12 world records. One of the most unusual is the record set by Christian Adam13 of Germany. Adam rode his bicycle 60.45 kilometers while playing the violin. More amazingly, he was riding backwards when he set this record! Then there was David Kremmer14 from Wisconsin15, U.S.A., who stacked16 ten bowling balls16 on top of each other, or John Evans17 of the U.K., who balanced a car on his head for thirty-three seconds. °@°@ °@°@For those who cannot get enough information about records from the book, there are Guinness World Records museums located throughout North America and Europe, and also in Taiwan. The Taiwan museum is unique. Its main hall17 resembles an enormous18 Guinness World Records book, and its snack bar looks like a giant hamburger. You can also watch Guinness World Records: Primetime18, a weekly television show, or you can visit the Guinness World Records website. °@°@ °@°@If you like, you can try to break a world record yourself. You don°¶t have to be strong or fast to set a new record. If you have plenty of time, you can grow your hair to a record19 length. A woman in China, whose hair is 5.627 meters long, has the current20 record. Or you could break the record for getting into a bathtub19 with the most live venomous20 snakes. Two people from the United States hold that record now. They got into a tub with seventy-six live rattlesnakes21. °@°@ °@°@Of course, even if you do officially21reak a record, you may not make it into the pages of the book. You may only get a certificate22 Thousands of records are broken annually23 but only a few hundred are included in the next year°¶s book. And be careful! The Guinness corporation24 takes no responsibility for accidents25 or injuries that may occur during your record-breaking attempt.  
Steven Spielberg °@°@Most of us can remember the titles1 of our favorite films. Few, however, can remember the directors of those films°Xwith a few exceptions. One of them, Steven Spielberg1, is a household name. He has entertained2 the world with stories of a daring3 archeologist. He°¶s made us cry with the tale4 of a space alien who just wanted to go home. He°¶s scared us with sharks and dinosaurs. And he brought us the horrors5 of World War II in Schindler°¶s List2 and Saving Private Ryan3. °@°@ °@°@Spielberg developed an interest in movies at an early age. At twelve, he started making his own short films with his dad°¶s movie camera. He sometimes enlisted6 his mother°¶s help. She would make movie props7 for him. Spielberg°¶s three sisters also liked to be in his movies°Xhe °ßkilled°® them all several times. °@°@ °@°@At age sixteen, Spielberg made his first feature8-length film4, Firelight5. His family rented a local movie theater to show it. He spent five hundred U.S. dollars making the film, but it earned back its whole budget9 in one night. °@°@ °@°@Spielberg got poor grades in high school and wasn°¶t accepted to any film schools. But never had he felt discouraged. Instead, he regularly10 bluffed his way onto the Universal Studios°¶6 lot11. He used an empty12 office as his own while trying to talk producers into looking at his films. °@°@ °@°@His twenty-two-minute film called Amblin°¶7 won awards at the Venice8 and Atlanta film festivals. It also caught the attention of the head of Universal°¶s TV division13. He signed Spielberg to a seven-year contract14. At twenty, Spielberg was the youngest director ever to get such a deal. °@°@ °@°@In 1974, Spielberg made his feature film debut15 with The Sugarland Express9. Spielberg really impressed producer Richard Zanuck10 with his skill in managing movie scenes. But audiences were less than thrilled16 with his efforts17. The film performed18 poorly at the box office11. °@°@ °@°@1975 was a different story, however. Spielberg was chosen to direct Jaws12. In an interview with a New York magazine, Spielberg said, °ßParts of the book terrorized19 me. I tried to translate my fear into visual language.°® He succeeded. People flocked20 to theaters to be scared out of their wits. °@°@ °@°@Spielberg continued his string of hits in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark13. The film earned Spielberg his first Oscar14 nomination21 for best director. Films two and three in the series22 also thrilled audiences. °@°@ °@°@In 1985, Spielberg challenged himself to make a more serious film. The Color Purple15 was the result. The film earned eleven Academy Award16 nominations, but didn°¶t win a single award. Finally, in 1993, Spielberg°¶s heartbreaking23 film Schindler°¶s List earned him an Academy Award for best director. °@°@ °@°@In 2002 Spielberg received another honor24 that he treasured highly°Xa college diploma25. He wanted to set an example for young people of the importance of a college education. But he hopes his children won°¶t take thirty-three years to finish their degrees26! °@°@ °@°@Spielberg continues to make films. Not all are box office hits, but each tells a story as only Spielberg can. He has ranked27 as the most successful director in the American film industry. Other directors may try to catch up with him°Xif they can. 
Tornadoes. °@°@It was a warm spring day when the Newport1 family began to hear a very loud and faraway sound from their farm in southern Kansas2. Moments later, they saw a swirling3 cloud. As it came closer, it grew darker and darker. The winds grew stronger. The house began to shake. Trees were being knocked down. As soon as they realized the danger they were facing, the parents rushed1 their five children into the cellar4 below the kitchen. When the children came out a few minutes later, they found their entire home blown away. If they had not been safely protected below the ground, they would surely have died. Their parents were not so lucky. Their bodies were found several hundred yards away. °@°@ °@°@The Newport family had been the unlucky victims of a tornado2. Although this tragedy3 happened years ago, in 1932, similar stories have been told over and over since then about the destructive4 power of these unpredictable storms. Every year, tornadoes cause serious problems all around the world. In August 2005, the state of Wisconsin was hit by nearly 30 tornadoes over a period5 of just six and a half hours. The storms caused about 21 million dollars in damage. Some years earlier, in May 1996, a far more deadly outbreak6 of tornadoes in Bangladesh5 left more than 700 dead and 30,000 injured. °@°@Tornadoes are essentially7 funnels6 of air rotating7 as fast as 300 miles per hour. Of course, not all tornadoes are so dangerous. Many more are small storms that form quickly and disappear, causing little or no damage. Such small tornadoes occur in many places around the world, even in southern Taiwan, where several are usually reported every spring. °@°@ °@°@It is, however, the big tornadoes that receive the most attention. These bring not only death and destruction, but also stories of strange phenomena8°Xflocks of dead birds dropping out of the sky, chickens still alive but with all of their feathers gone, pieces of straw stuck in trees. In a 1999 U.S. storm, violent winds from one tornado lifted9 a church into the air and dropped it onto a house. In the same storm, a baby was whipped8 from its mother°¶s arms and, miraculously10, found alive in a nearby tree. °@°@ °@°@What makes tornadoes so dangerous is not just their great power but also their unpredictable nature. Although scientists now know a great deal about tornadoes, they still cannot determine exactly when and where one will form. In addition, the path of a tornado can also be impossible to predict. It is unlikely to move in a straight line, and will often turn quickly. A tornado might blow down a line of houses, then suddenly lift up and leave one home unhurt, then touch back down and destroy the rest of the line. °@°@ °@°@To better understand tornadoes, scientists have developed special heavy-duty9 vehicles11 and weather-monitoring12 equipment13 that allow them to make close-up10 observations of these dangerous storms. Radar11 equipment is put on trucks and driven near a tornado, where it records wind speeds and other weather data14. Scientists often have to drive the radar hundreds of miles to chase15 down a tornado°Xa job that can be quite dangerous! °@°@ °@°@In addition, better communication and warning systems are also helping to reduce deaths and injuries in many tornado-prone16 areas. Radio and television warnings as well as sirens12 help to alert17 people to potential danger. Public awareness18 is also important. When tornadoes do occur, people must act quickly. They should move immediately to a safe place such as a basement19 or under a strong stairway13 and cover themselves with blankets or heavy coats. A tornado can arrive so unexpectedly20 that a matter of seconds can mean the difference between life and death. 
The House with Golden Windows. °@°@Two children living happily in their father°¶s house would often look in the evening to another house standing on a distant hilltop1. The evening sun painted it with glory2 as its rays3 were reflected from many windowpanes1. One afternoon the children started out to visit the house of the golden windows. They struggled over fields and through bush2 and woodland3 until at last the moment arrived. They stood before the enchanted house of their dreams and their hopes. But alas4! They found it deserted4 and bleak5. Many years°¶ worth of dust and slime5 had covered the panes of glass, which gave forth no golden splendor6. The house was lonely7, cold, forsaken8. Disappointed, discouraged, and afraid, they turned to go. As they did so their eyes fell on their own home in the distance, bathed9 in the golden splendor of the setting sun. °@°@ °@°@They saw this and more than this. Their sad experience had taught them to realize the inner10 light, not the reflected light, which shines in every home worthy of the name and makes it one of the brightest and dearest spots on earth°Xa refuge, a joy, a hope, and forever11 a happiness. It was under the spell of the light reflected from their own windows that the children caught the full vision12 of the inner and true light and glory of home. And they both cried out, °ßSee our house; our own home is the true house of the golden windows!°® 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄFew of us ponder how we got our names because we are so used to our naming traditions. If we look at the naming traditions of various cultures, we may learn something different from the things that we usually take for granted.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThere are some distinct differences between Chinese and Western cultures regarding naming customs. In the former, people tend to keep their family name from generation to generation. This is why there are tens of millions of people sharing common family names such as ‚ÄúWang‚Äù or ‚ÄúLi.‚Äù In many Western countries, on the other hand, surnames* often change and there tends to be a wider range of them. Furthermore, Chinese people show respect for their elders and ancestors by not passing on their given names. In Western societies, however, naming a child after an ancestor is an indication of esteem and affection.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhile in most cultures only the surname of the father is carried, in Spanish* -speaking countries, people take the family names of both their mother and father. For example, the celebrated Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal Parera* received ‚ÄúNadal‚Äù from his father and ‚ÄúParera‚Äù from his mother. Unlike the usual English names we know, the middle name is regarded as the surname in Spain and is passed on from generation to generation.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn cultures where family links are indicated in names, some unique rules exist. In Iceland*, a person‚Äôs last name usually comes directly from the first name of the father. For instance, a boy named Erik born to a father named Lars would be named Erik Larsson. Lars‚Äôs daughter, Kristin, would go by the name of Kristin Larsdottir. Therefore, the vast majority of Icelandic names end in either ‚Äúson‚Äù or ‚Äúdottir.‚Äù  You can imagine that when Erik has his own sons and daughters, their last names will be Eriksson and Eriksdottir respectively. For the Yami* people of Taiwan, the naming tradition works the other way around. In this culture, the son does not take the name of the father. Instead, the father changes his name upon the birth of his first son. For instance, a father who names his son Lamboan would also change his own name to Shaman Lamboan, meaning ‚ÄúFather of Lamboan.‚Äù Additionally, the boy‚Äôs grandfather‚Äôs name would be changed to Shabin Lamboan, which stands for ‚ÄúGrandfather of Lamboan.‚Äù  „ÄÄ„ÄÄNot all cultures suggest family relationships in their naming system. For example, in the Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar*, the convention is for people to go without a surname.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄOur names are determined by the customs and traditions of our culture. They also decide how we think of ourselves and our relationship to the culture. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in a name?‚Äù Shakespeare* inquired in one of his renowned plays. Apparently, quite a lot. 
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄYou might have heard of the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building, but have you heard of ‚ÄúThe Guggenheim‚Äù? It is not only one of New York City‚Äôs best-known museums but also one of its most important architectural landmarks. It‚Äôs the first Guggenheim Museum, but not the only one. You can visit five varied Guggenheim Museums around the world. „ÄÄ„ÄÄNew York‚Äôs Guggenheim, which opened on October 2, 1, is permanent home to a famous collection of modern and contemporary art and features special exhibitions throughout the year. It was planned by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation* and designed by an American architect Frank Lloyd Wright*. „ÄÄ„ÄÄWright loved nature as a child, and as an architect he felt that there must be natural forms for buildings so as to be in harmony with their surroundings. He could finally put his ideas into practice when the Solomon Guggenheim Foundation invited him to design the museum in New York. Never had the architect been so excited by a new challenge. He chose a site near Central Park so that one side of the museum would overlook water and trees. Wright wanted to create an ‚Äúorganic‚Äù structure that would open out into the world rather than isolate people from it. He was eager to experiment with a design that had fascinated him: the spiral shape of seashells that wind around themselves. „ÄÄ„ÄÄNew York‚Äôs Guggenheim is a cylindrical* building whose circular wall widens as it rises. Within the museum, all the paintings are displayed along the walls of the spiral. The building does not need any stairs. Instead, a widening spiral ramp* starts at ground level and circles upward around the wall five times until it reaches the top, where a huge skylight lights up the vast central space below. Thus, most visitors first take an elevator to the top and then slowly walk down the ramp, gazing at the paintings as they go. And because the walls lean outward, each painting is viewed from the slightly tilted angle at which Wright believed the artist himself or herself had looked at it while painting it. „ÄÄ„ÄÄVery pleased with Wright‚Äôs New York museum, the Guggenheim Foundation went on to establish three more museums in Europe. Frank Gehry‚Äôs* Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao*, Spain* is the best-known. Since Bilbao is a port city, Gehry made the museum look something like a ship, and the shiny metal pieces on the walls seem to have been designed to resemble fish scales. The second European Guggenheim is the Peggy Guggenheim Collection*, beautifully situated on the Grand Canal* in Venice*, Italy*. This museum, originally Peggy Guggenheim‚Äôs home, is devoted to modern and contemporary paintings. The third, Berlin‚Äôs* Deutsche Guggenheim*, may look somewhat ordinary from the outside, but it is actually considered one of the most exciting and experimental art museums in Germany*. It is a joint venture between the Guggenheim Foundation and Deustche Bank, the owner of the largest single art collection in the world. The newest one, the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi*, is estimated to be opened in 2. Also designed by world-famous architect Frank Gehry, it will be the world‚Äôs largest Guggenheim. The building will be a fine example of modern, international architecture with Middle-Eastern features.   „ÄÄ„ÄÄEach of these five museums houses many valuable artworks and has a unique architectural design that displays the architect‚Äôs creativity. It was the Guggenheim Museum in New York that was the first to break the mold. With its unconventional structure and whole new way of viewing paintings, this architectural masterpiece will surely continue to challenge and inspire us. 
The Greenhouse Effect and the Women of Guatemala.      Most people know something about the greenhouse effect. Animals and people breathe out the gas carbon dioxide, or CO2, and factories send much more of it into the atmosphere. In the past, this wasn°¶t a problem because plants, especially trees, absorbed the CO2. But now, with more trees being cut down and factories releasing more and more CO2, this greenhouse gas is accumulating in the upper atmosphere. This results in the steadily rising temperature of air and water near and on the Earth°¶s surface. To prevent this problem from getting worse, we need to stop burning coal, oil, and other carbon-based fuels. Renewable energy from the sun and wind is a much better option. But the simplest solution is to plant more trees, since one tree can absorb ten pounds of carbon dioxide every year.      In the past the mountains of Guatemala, in Central America, were thick and green with beautiful trees. But people cut down the trees for houses and firewood. As a result of this deforestation, the rain now washes good soil down the mountains, and women must walk for miles to get firewood.      Far away from Guatemala, in the state of Connecticut, there is a factory. Because this factory uses coal, it sends 400,000 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. But the factory owners are doing something about it. They are giving two million dollars to the women of Guatemala so that the women will plant trees in their country. These trees in Central America will absorb the carbon dioxide from the factory in Connecticut. Why plant trees in Guatemala instead of in Connecticut? The answer is simple. Trees grow much faster in Central America than in the northern part of the United States.      More trees will be good not only for the Earth°¶s atmosphere but also for Guatemala. In small villages in Guatemala, most women are poor and lead hard lives. Planting trees will help them in three ways. First, the Connecticut factory will pay them to plant the trees not with money but with corn which means more food for their children. Second, these women have a wealth of knowledge about their environment with regard to where to plant, when to plant, and what kinds of trees to plant. For example, they can plant many fruit trees, which add vitamins to their diets. They can plant other trees for firewood, and in a few years the women won°¶t have to spend so much time walking to get wood. Third, all these new trees will be good for the soil. The rain won°¶t be able to wash the soil down the mountains so easily.       This plan won°¶t be enough to stop the greenhouse effect, which is a problem for the whole world, but it°¶s a beginning. And the women of Guatemala will be helping themselves as well as their environment. As one woman says, °ßWe°¶re planting for our families, for our children.°®  ---from Interactions Access, A Reading/ Writing Book 2E, ?1997, by Pamela Hartmann and James Mentel, reprinted with permission of The McGraw-Hill Companies 
Graffiti.     A quiet street, a blank wall, a can of spray paint-- and a young person goes to work writing graffiti. The term graffiti means words or drawings scratched or painted on a wall. The word comes from the Greek term graphein, which means "to write." People have been writing graffiti on walls for thousands of years, but today some people believe that certain types of graffiti have evolved into a genuine art form.     Many of the oldest existing examples of graffiti are from the ancient city of Pompeii on the western coast of Italy. In the year 79, Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Ash from the volcano buried the city, preserving much of it for us to see today. Carved on the walls of Pompeii are many examples of graffiti. Some are declarations of love, while others are insults. Some are complaints about store owners who were cheating their customers, while others are political statements or rough drawings of people. Although the messages differ, all these examples of graffiti have one important thing in common: they were all made without the permission of the owner of the wall. For historians, however, the graffiti represents one of the few available sources of information about the lives of the average people of Pompeii and their everyday concerns.      The purpose of graffiti art is self-expression and creativity. According to one graffiti artist, "Creating graffiti is an art, and just like any other art, it requires tons of practice and work." Today, most graffiti art is made with spray paint, although some artists also use brushes and markers. For graffiti artists, just about anything can serve as a surface for their artwork, even rocks, roads, and billboards.     Of course not everyone likes or approves of graffiti on city walls. In fact, most people think of creating graffiti as vandalism rather than art. For the majority of people, doing graffiti without someone's permission is not freedom of expression; it is arrogance. And the presence of graffiti in their neighborhoods makes many people feel less safe. Seeing graffiti all around them makes many people feel that danger is just around the corner.     In the 1980s, many cities started taking action against graffiti. The city of New York, for example, started a campaign to get rid of graffiti on subway cars. By painting over the graffiti soon after it was created, the city was able to discourage graffiti artists from decorating the subway cars. Then, in 1987, a new type of paint-resistant subway car became available, making it impossible for graffiti artists to paint on the cars. The city of Los Angeles bought several "paint stores on wheels" to combat graffiti. These cars traveled around the city looking for graffiti and painting over it immediately. The city's goal was to discourage graffiti artists by painting over their graffiti within twenty-four hours.     Does this mean the end of graffiti? Not quite. In some countries, such as Japan, England, and the United States, graffiti artists are allowed to do their work on specially designated walls in a city. Graffiti art is shown in museums, and in Australia, well-known companies sponsor graffiti competitions. There are also hundreds of websites that feature graffiti art, as well as many books and instructional videos. And of course, there are still people who will try to leave their mark on someone else's wall. 
M-E-M-O: Four Tips for a Better Memory. °@°@"Memorize these words." "Learn this spelling rule." "Don't forget the quiz tomorrow."  °@°@ °@°@You have to remember things every day, but how do you do it? You find a telephone number in the phone book, dial it, and then quickly forget it. This is your short-term memory at work. It lasts less than thirty seconds. However, you don't need to look up your best friend's number in the phone book because you already know it. This is because the information is stored in your long-term memory. °@°@ °@°@ °@°@Have you ever wondered why you forget things easily? Do you find it difficult to learn new information by heart? The following tips will help you to improve your memory: °@°@ 1. Make sense °@°@It is easier to remember information if you understand it. Textbook units should not be read like chapters in a novel. When you read a lesson, skim through all the headings first to get the main ideas. Next ask yourself questions by adding words such as "who," "what," "where," "when," "why" or "how" to the headings to get the big picture. Then try to put the information together in your own words.  °@°@ 2. Experience °@°@One way to remember is by forming associations, that is, by using your senses or physical movements to link up a new fact with information you already have learned. Take the words moo, coo, and quack for example. You might associate these words with the sounds cows, birds, and ducks make. You can also relate the idioms thumbs up and thumbs down to the gestures showing approval and disapproval. 3. Mnemonics: Memory Cues     When you need to remember a group of terms, use the first letter of each to create a word or a phrase. This helps you find the right path when you are lost and cannot remember. For example, to remember a list of North African countries (Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya), you can take the first letter of each country's name and form the acronym METAL. You could add a recall helper with a picture and/or sentence in mind: Explorers found precious METAL in North Africa.  4. Overlearn  °@°@After you learn something, study it some more. For example, you might end your study session by reciting all of the questions and answers you created for yourself previously. Repeat the process periodically. Only by reviewing in small doses-- five to ten minutes at a time-- can you learn efficiently. Try to relax when you study. You cannot remember things when you are tired or unhappy. °@°@ °@°@As a student, it is almost impossible to learn every detail in your textbook and notebook. Keep the above "M-E-M-O" tips in mind. Select the key information and figure out for yourself the best way to improve your memory. This way, you'll never be regarded as a forgetful person! 
Sing with the Poets. °@°@A poem cannot be perfect without the presence of pleasant or musical sounds. Poets make particular choices in their arrangement of words to create musical qualities in their poetry. Readers, when reading a poem, may feel the effects created by the sounds of those carefully selected words. Therefore, in addition to vivid imagery or delicate, figurative language, the music of poetry can reinforce the meanings that poets wish to convey. °@°@ °@°@To produce special "sound effects" in poetry, poets make use of repetition, with the regular use of specific sounds or stressed and unstressed syllables. This is a technique that makes a poem rhythmic. Read the following work by Robert Frost and pay attention to the effect of the sounds within:  °@°@ Nothing Gold Can Stay by Robert Frost  Nature's first green is gold,  Her hardest hue to hold.  Her early leaf's a flower;  But only so an hour.  Then leaf subsides to leaf.  So Eden sank to grief,  So dawn goes down to day.  Nothing gold can stay.    Each line of the poem is made up of six syllables, except the last line. A stressed syllable and an unstressed one form a foot, and different numbers of feet form a meter. Therefore, each line of this short poem basically contains three feet, which conveys a balanced rhythm. In addition, in lines like "green is gold," "hue to hold," or "dawn goes down to day," the initial consonants produce a special sound effect, called alliteration. The momentary nature of life is expressed through these sound devices, since "dawn" soon becomes "day."        In the next poem, a similar issue is brought out through the poet's description of the passing of a day, which implies the fleeting nature of time. For instance, "the sun kept setting, setting still" and "the dusk kept dropping, dropping still" connote the vanishing of time and life:        The Sun Kept Setting, Setting Still by Emily Dickinson The sun kept setting, setting still; No hue of afternoon Upon the village I perceived,--  From house to house 'twas noon. The dusk kept dropping, dropping still; No dew upon the grass, But only on my forehead stopped, And wandered in my face. My feet kept drowsing, drowsing still, My fingers were awake; Yet why so little sound myself Unto my seeming make? How well I knew the light before! I could not see it now. 'Tis dying, I am doing; but I'm not afraid to know. °@°@The poet, Emily Dickinson, also creates distinctive sound patterns by repeating certain words and sounds, which produces an intense rhythm and meaning. For example, the alliteration of "sun," "setting," and "still," or of "dusk" and "dropping" intensifies the passage of time, and the repetition of the same words implies the inevitable ending of mortal life. However, in the last stanza Dickinson would rather face death with courage than feel frightened of it. °@°@ °@°@Now, aside from the beautiful language in poetry, you can also appreciate the expressive melody of a poem. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe American Geo Prizm1 was made at the same factory as the Japanese2 Toyota Corolla3 from 1989 to 2002. But, even though the former1 sold for US$2,000 less than the latter2, twice as many Toyotas were sold. Why? Because European4 consumers3 trusted4 the Toyota brand5 more than Geo and they were happy to pay more for it.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄToday‚Äôs consumers often have difficulty deciding what to buy because many products are not different in quality6 or features. Therefore, more and more people rely on brand names. In fact, a brand name has become an asset5. The Coca-Cola6 brand name is valued at US$84 billion, which is 59 percent7 of the company‚Äôs market value. To make more money, executives must have a deep understanding of what brands are, how they help to make money for the company, and how they affect a company.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄYou may have noticed that brands are a part of your everyday lives. For example, first thing in the morning, you can go for a run wearing Nike7 shoes. Then, you might drive to the office in a new Lexus8, and stop along the way for a cup of coffee at Starbucks9. However, these are not just shoes, cars, and coffee. These are brands. The names seem to promise a certain8 quality and style9 that you rely on. In other words, a brand is a combination of the product‚Äôs image, the promises it makes to consumers, and the values it stands for. The promise of Nokia10, for example, is consistent quality. In addition, brands encourage consumers to choose products based on certain personality or lifestyle characteristics10: Levi‚Äôs11 stands for individualism while Nike represents11 a ‚Äújust do it‚Äù way of thinking. „ÄÄ„ÄÄCompanies with strong brands make huge benefits. Some of these benefits are described as follows:  Brands drive consumer choice. Consumers are more likely to do business with brands they know, respect, and trust.  Brands increase consumer loyalty12. Because consumers are more likely to choose brands they know and trust, it makes sense that consumers have the strongest loyalty to companies with good brands.  Brands assist13 new market entry14. Companies with strong brands are more likely to successfully enter new markets. The Disney brand name is so strong that the Disney Cruise Line13 became one of the most successful new product launches15 on record.  Brands allow16 for higher prices. Mercedes-Benz14, for example, is so famous for its high quality that its SUV15 has been able to sell at a high price, despite the fact that Mercedes had never made SUVs before. Brands attract employees17. According to a survey18 of MBA16 graduates, when choosing which job to accept, they ranked19 the company‚Äôs brand name as the number one thing affecting their decision20. Brand name of the company was 25 percent higher than salary21 on the list of considerations.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄFinally, if a company is concerned with making money, it must build its brand name. A strong brand can carry a company into new markets, through change, and beyond the competition22. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄHer Cherokee1 name was Nanye‚Äôhi2. The English settlers on the American frontier2 called her Nancy Ward3. But to her people, this Cherokee woman was best known as ‚ÄúBeloved Woman.‚Äù This was the title3 given to those women in high positions who made decisions for the tribe4. „ÄÄ„ÄÄDuring the American Revolution5, the warriors4 in her village had helped the British5 by attacking6 a colonial7 settlement in Georgia6. In her home, Nancy waited for the warriors to return from the battle8. Tired and weary9, the Cherokee war party returned to the village. As news spread10 of the dead and missing, cries of sadness7 rose among the people. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe warriors brought back with them a white woman named Lydia Bean8. ‚ÄúAll the other people had gone away, but she stayed behind to save her cows when I captured her,‚Äù one warrior boasted11. 	The crowd seized12 the woman, because she could give them what  they were seeking13‚Äîrevenge14 for their lost warriors. „ÄÄ„ÄÄFrom her home, Nancy Ward heard the angry shouts of her   people. She opened a wooden15 chest and took out a white swan‚Äôs wing,   a symbol of her high position16. Then she rushed17 out of her house. „ÄÄ„ÄÄPushing her way through the excited crowd, Nancy saw Mrs. Bean tied to a wooden stake9. Sticks and logs were piled18 on the ground at her feet. A torch10 was in a man‚Äôs hand ready to set the woman on fire. „ÄÄ  ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù Nancy cried. She spoke as the tribe‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeloved Woman‚Äù now. Moving the white swan‚Äôs wing through the air in a wide, sweeping19 gesture, she demanded20, ‚ÄúCherokees, listen to me! Haven‚Äôt you had enough bloodshed11? Let your tears21 flow22 for those who have not returned, but hold your hand still.‚Äù  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe crowd was suddenly quiet. The swan‚Äôs wing paused23 in its flight and pointed to the man who held the flaming torch. He nodded in agreement24 and dropped the torch. „ÄÄ„ÄÄPointing the swan‚Äôs wing at Mrs. Bean, Nancy requested25, ‚ÄúCut the ropes, and release that woman.‚Äù Nancy came forward and helped the  woman through the crowd. Slowly the two women made their way up the dirt26 road, leaving the silent crowd behind them. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn a few days, Lydia Bean had recovered27 from the shock of her terrible experience and soon became friends with Nancy. Weeks    passed as Nancy looked for a way to send Lydia home. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúWhy did you stop to take care of your cows instead of running away?‚Äù   „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt leave them,‚Äù Lydia answered. ‚ÄúTheir milk‚Äîit‚Äôs good  for the children.‚Äù  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúBut there is mother‚Äôs milk,‚Äù Nancy said. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù answered Lydia, ‚Äúmilk for babies, but often there     is not enough. And then there are the older children and adults.‚Äù  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúOur people have never raised them. Since cows are slow-   moving, many of the Cherokees believe that people who eat their    meat will move as slowly as the cows.‚Äù  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to criticize28 Cherokee beliefs,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm sure they are mistaken.‚Äù  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúThat could be,‚Äù Nancy said, smiling.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúCattle have been valuable since the beginning of civilization,‚Äù Lydia continued. ‚ÄúFrom cows there is meat, of course, as well as milk. And from milk come butter and cheese.‚Äù After Lydia told Nancy about making butter and cheese, Nancy said, ‚ÄúWe must have cows.‚Äù   „ÄÄ„ÄÄThen, with Lydia as a teacher, the Cherokees learned how to milk cows and make butter and cheese.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen it was time for Lydia to leave, she tried to express29 her thanks. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI only did what was right,‚Äù said Nancy, ‚Äúbut you have helped our whole tribe. You have taught us the great benefits of cows.‚Äù   „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúIt is you who have done it, Nancy,‚Äù said Lydia. ‚ÄúYou have brought great knowledge to your people that will benefit them forever.‚Äù  
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄBy the time the birds are singing and the sun comes up, many people are already enjoying a cup of coffee. Drinking a cup of coffee is a morning ritual2 millions of people all over the world share. Because people want coffee so much, it has become an important commodity3, second only to petroleum1 in dollars traded4. Here are some facts everyone should know about one of the world‚Äôs most popular beverages5. A rich history  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe magic of the coffee plant was discovered around 900 AD2  by a shepherd3 in a place called Kaffa4. He noticed his sheep became active after eating a certain kind of berry6. He tried some himself and experienced a similar effect7. Although this may not be the true story, it is probably quite close. Historians8 believe the word ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù does, in fact, go back to Kaffa. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAround 1000 AD, Arab5 traders took coffee home to Yemen6. They tried boiling9 the beans10, inventing11 a drink they called ‚Äúwine that keeps you awake.‚Äù „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe Arab world began expanding12 its trade horizons13, and the coffee beans moved into northern Africa and were cultivated14. From there, the beans entered the Indian and European markets, and the coffee culture started to spread to the rest15 of the world. Compassionate16 coffee „ÄÄ„ÄÄBecause of the effort needed to brew17 that perfect cup, selling hot coffee has always been good business. That‚Äôs why coffee is a major 7cash crop18 in South America. However, while new farming methods19 have made growing coffee more efficient20 than before, these new methods are hurting the environment. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn the past, coffee was grown under a covering of trees which not only protected the coffee, but also provided birds  with a winter home. „ÄÄ„ÄÄWith growing demand for coffee, new coffee plants were introduced to increase the amount of harvest21. However, for these plants to get enough light from the sun, forests have been cut down. As a result, the birds have lost their winter homes. Furthermore, with the trees cut down, soil22 erosion8 and need of pesticides increased. It became obvious that  sun-grown9 coffee was causing an environmental disaster23. „ÄÄ„ÄÄGradually24, people are becoming aware of the benefits offered by shade-grown10 coffee. The roots of the shade25 trees help keep the soil in place, so the erosion problem is taken care of. Since the shade-grown plants need fewer pesticides, the environment isn‚Äôt damaged by them. Moreover, a single26 farm with shade-grown coffee can act as a special place for birds. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn fact, companies that sell coffee, including Starbucks, are beginning to offer shade-grown coffee. So spend a bit more and make your next cup of coffee a caring one‚Äîthe earth and birds will thank you. 
Unit 12  The Road Not Taken. 	Robert Frost was one of the greatest American poets of the 20th century. He is the only poet to have won four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry. According to John F. Kennedy, °ßHe has bequeathed his nation a body of imperishable verse from which Americans will forever gain joy and understanding.°® Frost°¶s poems express a sense of common humanity and have appealed to generations of readers. His poems are mostly descriptions of rural life and everyday events that explore deep aspects of human experience. °ßThe Road Not Taken°® is a prime example of this. °ßThe Road Not Taken°® Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I°– I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. 	°ßThe Road Not Taken°® was written during Frost°¶s stay in England, when he used to take walks with his friend who liked to choose routes at random. Yet, afterward, Frost°¶s friend would always complain that they could have enjoyed even more gorgeous scenery if it had not been for his previous choice. Frost was thus inspired to write this poem, which captures the dilemma of human decision-making. 	In this poem, the narrator was a traveler who needed to choose which route to take in the woods. In the end, he selected the superficially less trodden one. Since there was little possibility of going back for the other one, he could not help but imagine himself telling his choice-making tale with °ßa sigh°® many years later. The narrator°¶s inner conflict, therefore, makes choosing a road in the countryside a symbol of making a decision in life. 	Frost°¶s sensitive poetic narrative may arouse great empathy in many of us when we recall the past decision-making experiences in our lives. When in distress, we tend to look back on the moments when we needed to make important choices. In effect, once we make a choice, we have to let go of all the other alternatives. Every choice will lead us to a different series of other choices, and it is impossible to reverse the situation. 	The poem can also be an inspiration for those who need to make important decisions about their futures. For example, a student might stand at a crossroads, such as choosing which subject to major in or which college to attend. Later in life, there will be career paths to choose as well. Whatever problems we are confronted with and whatever our choices are, it will, at any rate, be no use regretting any choice that has been made. The final choice is ours, and ours alone. °–By Yen-sheng Hsia and Ian Fletcher
Unit 12  The Journey Ahead. 	I was twenty-five when I was arrested for stealing a loaf of bread to feed my starving family. For that petty crime, I spent nineteen years in jail. 	When I was discharged from prison, I was a bitter man. I walked for miles, trying to find somewhere to rest. By the time I reached Digne, the sun had already set, and I was hungry and exhausted. 	I headed for an inn, seeking accommodation for the night. Looking me up and down with distrust and suspicion, the owner of the inn sent a boy to the police station to inquire about me. When the boy returned, he handed the owner a note. From the note, the owner learned that my name was Jean Valjean and that I was an ex-convict. As a result, he refused to let me in. 	I left the inn in humiliation. I could feel that people behind me were exchanging looks of fear and that my arrival would soon become the talk of the town. Just as I had expected, everyone in Digne knew that I was released on parole. Consequently, no one was willing to reach out to me, and even a glass of water was too much for me to ask for. Cold and starving, I was left shivering in the dark. 	Fortunately, the bishop of Digne took pity on me and welcomed me with open arms. Even after he knew my true identity, this man didn°¶t drive me out of his home as most others had done. Instead, he invited me to stay and dine with him. 	That night, though I was lucky enough to sleep in bed for the first time in nineteen years, I couldn°¶t fall asleep. I kept thinking about the precious silverware on the bishop°¶s dining table. I should have thanked him for offering me food and shelter, yet I found myself deeply disturbed by the thought of how unfairly society had treated me over the past years. After a slight hesitation, I got up, stole the silverware, and slipped away. However, I didn°¶t get far. By the time it was dawn, the police had caught me and taken me back to the bishop. 	°ßI°¶m so delighted to see you again!°® the bishop said to me before I could speak. °ßYou forgot to take the candlesticks.°® 	With my eyes nearly popping out of my head, I was stunned by his words°Xthe bishop had not only forgiven me for my crime but also wanted me to have his only possession of value. 	After the police left, the bishop told me, °ßEveryone deserves a second chance. Promise me that you will use this silver to become an honest man.°® He continued solemnly, °ßJean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It is your soul that I am buying for you, and I give it to God!°® 	I left the bishop°¶s house and roamed the countryside. My thoughts were on my dreadful days in prison and on my wasted life. I was upset and angry. But as I brooded over my misery, the bishop°¶s words flashed through my mind. All at once, my anger and gloom somehow vanished. The bishop°¶s love and forgiveness had cast out my hatred for the world. 	From that moment on, I was truly free. I, Jean Valjean, became a changed man and never committed another crime. °XAdapted from Les Mis?rables by Victor Hugo.
