Lesson 3 Keeping Your Brain Healthy. °@°@The brain1 is one of the most complex2 organs3 in our body. Brain matter is very soft, much like tofu1, and is made up of billions2 of cells and trillions3 of nerves that send information to the rest of the body.   °@°@What can you do to keep your brain healthy? The most important thing is to exercise it. Playing games that use numbers and words, such as crossword puzzles4 and Sudoku4, is a great way to keep your brain working. Games that use more planning, such as chess and mahjong5, are even better. Creative activities, such as writing, drawing, and painting, are other great ways to stimulate5 your brain. Even small things, like brushing your teeth with a different hand, could be enough to keep your brain from getting lazy and weak.  	 °@°@Secondly, physical exercise, such as walking, running, and swimming, can actually create new brain cells. Studies show that people who exercise for as little as fifteen minutes every day use more of their brain power than people who do not exercise. Team sports that require more thinking, like volleyball6 and soccer, make your brain work even harder. °@°@°@Last but not least, what you eat can play a large part in keeping your brain healthy. Protein, found in foods like meat, fish, milk, and soybeans7, provides the basic materials for building new tissue6 and for keeping all your organs healthy and strong. Fish and fish oil have omega-3 fats8, which, if you think of your brain as a car, will keep it moving like a Ferrari9 or a Mercedes-Benz10.   °@°@°@There are many things you can do to keep your brain healthy and active. Learning new things, visiting new places, and playing games are the first step. Exercising and eating well are also important. A person is never too old or too young to start practicing these habits, so be smart°Xstart today! 	    1  
Doctors without Borders. °@°@In 1971, a small group of doctors in Paris formed an organization. Their goal was to provide emergency1 medical2 aid3, no matter where it was needed or who needed it. This was the beginning of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)1, or, in English, Doctors without Borders2. The philosophy4 of MSF is that all people have the right to medical care, regardless of race, religion, or nationality5. Today, according to MSF, the world needs medical doctors who can provide aid to any nation quickly, efficiently6, and without political pressure. °@°@ °@°@MSF began as °ßa couple of doctors with a suitcase7 and a dream.°® Now it is the largest nongovernmental8 organization for emergency medical relief9. It has offices in twenty countries and has provided medical help in eighty-five countries, including Rwanda3, Chechnya4, Kosovo5, Liberia6, Afghanistan7, and Iraq8. MSF sends teams not only to locations that are in the spotlight but also to places where forgotten wars continue to cause suffering. °@°@ °@°@Because so much of MSF°¶s work is done in dangerous locations, it takes great bravery to be an MSF worker. MSF workers have been shot at, wounded10, kidnapped11, and killed. They have also been infected with the diseases that they were trying to fight. °@°@ °@°@All of MSF°¶s international workers are volunteers12. Only a small number of the volunteers are doctors. Most volunteers serve as nurses, medical technicians13, sanitation14 engineers, and administrators9. Although the volunteers are paid only a small amount to cover15 their cost of living, they are rewarded16 in many other ways. One doctor said that practicing medicine at a refugee17 camp was like getting a hands-on10 lesson in the history of medicine, far away from his everyday experiences18 in a modern medical center. Another volunteer summed up her work this way: °ßIt°¶s a life-changing experience.°® °@°@ °@°@MSF is best known for its rapid19 response20 in times of crisis21. When a medical emergency occurs, MSF sends in an advance22 team to find out what kind of help is needed. This team arranges23 transportation24, often to remote areas. Teams may travel by jeep11, boat, helicopter12, or even on foot. The advance team then contacts25 one of its four regional centers, located in Europe, East Africa, Central America, and East Asia. The center organizes teams of volunteers and sends kits13 of supplies and equipment. The membership26 of the team and the contents27 of the kits depend on the type of emergency. For example, in a war or natural disaster, MSF sends in medical teams with emergency-room experience and fully equipped surgical tents14, electrical generators15, medicine, food, and clean water. °@°@ °@°@Another important function28 of MSF is to educate people in developed nations about worldwide medical problems. Every year, the group publishes a list called the Top Ten Underreported Humanitarian29 Stories about wars and disasters that receive little attention from the international media. MSF also educates people in developing countries about infectious diseases, such as sleeping sickness, malaria16, and tuberculosis17. In addition, MSF highlights30 the lack31 of important drugs in poor nations. MSF points out that fourteen million people die each year from tropical diseases. However, out of 1,393 new drugs32 developed since 1975, only about 1% were targeted33 at these diseases. °@°@ °@°@In 1999, the Norwegian Nobel Committee18 awarded MSF the Peace Prize for its °ßpioneering34 humanitarian work on several continents.°® This prize is usually given to individuals35; only a few organizations have received it. James Orbinski19, president36 of MSF at the time, said that medical aid should not be tied37 to wars or politics, but only to the dignity of people. He went on to say, °ßAn organization like this shows how much can be accomplished38 with simple and affordable methods.°® °@°@ 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄDespite the cold January weather in Taipei, things are getting hot in the underground mall between two MRT stations. Bodies and limbs are whirling about in a frenzy* of windmills, headspins and handglides. It may sound like a street fight, but there‚Äôs nothing violent about the thing that is happening here. The combatants are actually taking part in a street dance competition. „ÄÄ„ÄÄStreet dance has its roots in American hip hop* culture, which emphasizes the expression of the self and the courage to try new things. It began as a way for African Americans to express themselves and their frustrations through dance. The trend found its way to Taiwan in the mid-s and has been growing in popularity ever since. „ÄÄ„ÄÄFrom Taipei to Hualien, more and more young people in Taiwan have discovered the liberation* and the freedom of expression through street dance. It is a welcome escape from the relative rigidity* of other dance forms, such as ballet* or ballroom* dancing. There are no set rules in street dance. Instead, it‚Äôs about testing the body‚Äôs limits. When doing the windmill, a male dancer rotates* on his upper body with his legs spinning around in the air. The headspin is one of the most visually stunning moves, where the dancer spins on his head. From a headspin or a windmill, dancers can change into a handglide, in which they support their entire body weight with just one hand while spinning. This move gets high marks for its degree of difficulty.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn addition to taking the human body to its absolute physical limits, street dance moves also test the limits of one‚Äôs creativity. That‚Äôs why more and more battle-style competitions are popping up. There are more than 3 such contests in the hottest time of the year for street dance. In these competitions, two combatants from any two dance groups, also known as crews, stand face to face. One will pull off a move and the other has to follow; if the latter succeeds, he will perform his own move for the former to follow. The first one that is unable to match his opponent‚Äôs move loses. To win their battles, crews will practice for weeks in preparation for a competition.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄStreet dance has little prestige* enjoyed by other forms of dance; however, street dancers take pride in the things that they‚Äôre doing. For many of them, this dance style represents something more than just movement. As a famous dancer with 1 years of experience puts it, ‚ÄúDance is my only way of reaching out and communicating with the world.‚Äù The young dance crews that have followed in this veteran‚Äôs* footsteps agree. It is they who will take this underdog* of the dance world to new heights. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄHummingbirds, also called hummers, are named for the sound produced by their rapidly moving wings. When early Spanish explorers in the Americas saw hummingbirds for the first time, they called them ‚Äúflying jewels.‚Äù Most hummingbirds have colorful feathers, with males‚Äô colors being brighter than those of females. Today these tiny birds, with their brilliant colors and lightning-fast movements, still capture people‚Äôs imaginations.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄMale hummingbirds are the smallest warm-blooded animals on earth. Among them, the Bee Hummingbird is the smallest. Its average weight is 1. grams. So small is this bird that it can be hard to spot. But if you do see one, you will notice its long, slender beak and rainbow-like colors. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAs tiny as hummers are, their flying abilities set them apart from all the other birds. Hummers normally fly at a speed of 2 to 3 miles per hour, and they can dive at around 6 miles per hour! It was reported that one hummingbird kept up with a car going 5- miles per hour. What‚Äôs still more amazing is that hummingbirds can fly forward, backward or upside down, and can even hover* in mid-air. The ability to hover allows the birds to stay over a flower long enough to suck out all the nectar* they need.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn normal flight, a hummer‚Äôs wings beat about 1- times per second, depending on the size of the bird. This movement burns a lot of energy; therefore, the birds need to eat every 1- minutes. One bird may drink from 1, flowers and eat between 4 and 5 insects in a single day. Without enough food, hummingbirds can starve to death in an hour.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄHummingbirds live only in the Americas, spending most of their time in the warmer climates. They seem to be able to detect the changes in the length of days as well as the changes in the insect and flower populations. Before winter comes, they migrate to avoid the cold and find enough food. In spring they start journeying back to their birthplace to breed. The males generally fly home about three weeks earlier than the females. Researchers believe that some hummingbirds fly non-stop over the Gulf of Mexico. This unbelievable 5-mile flight takes more than 1 hours! As for distance, the Rufous Hummingbird* migrates the longest distance, from Mexico to Alaska and back, a total of 1, miles. „ÄÄ„ÄÄYou probably won‚Äôt have the chance to see any hummingbirds in Taiwan, but if you go to the Americas, you might have a chance to catch a glimpse of these sparkling little flying jewels! 
How to Make an Effective Speech.    Half the world is composed of people who have something to say and can°¶t; the other half have nothing to say and keep saying it. Whoever wants to be a good speaker needs to know how to express himself or herself well. Are you interested in making an effective speech? If the answer is yes, there are five elements you should consider. 1. Be Prepared. Being prepared is by far the most important element. How many times do you practice your speech? As a general rule, you should spend about thirty hours of preparation and rehearsal time for every hour you will be speaking. Use a tape recorder or videotape yourself. This will help you to get an accurate picture of how you speak.  2. Give of Yourself. Look for opportunities to use personal examples and stories in your speech. Make sure your stories help to emphasize or support your point. The stories must match your message. Use examples from your personal and/or professional life to make your point. In either case, be willing to give of yourself by sharing some of yourself with the audience.  3. Stay Relaxed. To stay relaxed you should be prepared. Also, focus on your message and not the audience. Use gestures, including walking patterns. Practice the opening of your speech and plan exactly how you will say it. The audience will judge you in the first thirty seconds they see you.  4. Use Natural Humor. Don°¶t try to be a stand-up comedian. Use natural humor by poking fun at yourself°Xsomething you said or did. Be sure NOT to make fun of anyone in the audience. People will laugh with you when you poke fun at yourself, but don°¶t overdo it.  5. Plan Your Body and Hand Positions. As you practice your speech, look for occasions when you can use a gesture. Establish three positions where you will stand; then decide how and at what points in your speech you will move. Pick one position on center stage, one to your right, and one to your left. Do not hide behind the lectern. When you do move, maintain eye contact with the audience.  °@The key point to remember in giving an effective speech is to start preparing for it early. It is very important that you pay attention to even the smallest details. You can never overplan. As the saying goes, °ßHe who fails to plan is planning for failure.°® °Xadapted from °ßElements of an Effective Speech°® by Lenny Laskowski, ? LJL Seminars: http://www.ljlseminars.com.

 Yummy°¶s Blog.      A different face of Taiwan comes alive with the night falling over towns and cities of Taiwan. Street stalls, sidewalk vendors and small canteens create a special scene of Taiwan°¶s night life. Your trip to Taiwan will never be complete without paying a visit to °ßnight markets.°® They offer you a good chance to shop for bargains as well as to feel the pulse of Taiwan°¶s night life. You can simply enjoy yourself shopping, eating, and strolling with your friends in the cool of the evening.       Every night market has its own specialties. If you plan to spend only a short time in Taiwan, I suggest that you begin with Taiwanese cuisine in the Shihlin Night Market in Taipei. It is my favorite night market and you can find the island°¶s best-known snacks there. Now just see what I°¶ve got for you.       Bun in a Bun (Da Bing Bao Xiao Bing)    Da Bing Bao Xiao Bing, one of the most famous snacks, is surely something you can°¶t miss at the Shihlin Night Market. °ßDa bing°® in Chinese means a bigger bun, and °ßxiao bing°® means a smaller one. It is called °ßbun in a bun°® because inside the big bun there is a crispy °ßxiao bing.°® Or you could say the small bun is wrapped in the °ßda bing.°® With this snack you will have many different choices. My favorite is sweet peanuts with salty curry. Just the sound of this crispy snack makes my mouth water.         Super-Sized Huge Chicken Steak (Hao Da Ji Pai)      Hao Da Chicken Steak is said to be the earliest °ßchicken steak°® in Taiwan. If you see a row of these golden chicken steaks, don°¶t be shocked by their size. (Each one might be larger than a person°¶s face). Have a bite and you°¶ll find the skin crispy, the meat tender and juicy.       Stir-Fried Squid (Sheng Chao Hua Zhi)      As you can see, sliced fresh squid is stir-fried with garlic, sliced bamboo shoots, and amazing spices of all kinds. Within seconds it will be on your table. This dish has a very special taste because everything is boiled in a thick soup. Sweet and sour in taste, Sheng Chao Hua Zhi will really satisfy you.       Shihlin Big Sausages  (Shihlin Da Xiangchang)        This snack looks like a hot dog but is much bigger. Don°¶t be shocked by the huge barbecued sausage. If you are willing to pay more, why not try the deluxe one?      It°¶s past midnight now and I°¶ve only put a few of the many snacks available at Shihlin Night Market on my night-market blog. There are many other special dishes, including frogs°¶ eggs (Don°¶t worry! They don°¶t come from real frogs!), oyster omelets, and stinky tofu. If my stomach were as huge as the Titanic, I would love to try everything in a single visit. Next time you come to Taiwan, make sure you save a night or two for a visit to our exciting night markets. They never sleep! Write a reply to Yummy Yummy, You know what? Mr. Sage, who teaches us math here in the States, plans to visit Taiwan next month. Can you be his guide, please?                                                          Fish                                                 --by Christy Murphy 
Walt Disney: The Dreamer. °@°@Disneyland, the "happiest place on Earth," opened in July 1955, but Walt Disney had begun dreaming of building it much earlier. In the early 1940s, Disney took his daughters, Sharon and Diana, to an old and dirty amusement park. Watching his girls ride the merry-go-round, he started to dream of building a theme park of his own, a safe and clean place where parents and children alike would be entertained. °@°@Disney worked day and night on plans for his park. He visited amusement parks all around the world to get ideas. Finally, through the power of imagination, Disney created the Disneyland that we know today. Here, visitors are swept away to a land of tropical jungles, American pioneer settlements, and storybook castles. °@°@From a very young age, Disney loved to draw. He created his own comic strips and dreamed of becoming a cartoonist. He was often scolded at school for drawing instead of doing his schoolwork. In 1923, with his brother Roy, Disney borrowed money and started the Disney Brothers' Studio in Hollywood. The studio had only one used camera, and the restroom did double duty as a darkroom! °@°@Things got better when one of Disney's characters, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, became popular. Disney went to New York to ask for more money, but he was refused and was even cheated out of the copyright to Oswald. To protect Roy from the difficult truth, Disney sent him a telegram saying, "Don't worry. Everything OK." On his way back to Los Angeles, Disney was thinking of a replacement for Oswald and recalled a pet mouse he had once had. This memory inspired the creation of a new character: a little fellow in red shorts named Mickey Mouse. Mickey became a celebrity overnight. But Disney never stopped trying to break new ground. He then went on to create his first full-length animated movie, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. °@°@Creative and highly dedicated to his work, Disney paid attention to even the smallest details. He would work long hours each day, editing song lyrics and planning different special effects. Many nights, he would convince his wife to sleep on his office couch while he stayed late in the studio. His dedication paid off with the success of classic animated films like Pinocchio and Bambi. °@°@Despite the huge popularity of Disney's films, Disneyland remains his greatest achievement. This project, a dream come true for him, also allows millions to realize their own dreams. Disney himself summed up the park's magic: "It has that thing°Xthe imagination and the feeling of happy excitement°XI knew when I was a kid." --from Landmark English, May 2005
Is Your Diet Destroying the Environment?      A vegetarian diet is often praised for its health benefits. Vegetarians usually have lower levels of heart disease, and studies have shown that they have a lower risk of diabetes than people who eat meat. What most people are less aware of, however, are the effects that a vegetarian diet, compared to a non-vegetarian diet, can have on the environment.       Researchers from the Union of Concerned Scientists in the U.S. recently studied how consumer behavior affects the environment. The study showed that meat consumption is one of the main ways that humans can damage the environment, second only to the use of motor vehicles.      So how can eating meat have a negative effect on the environment? For a start, all livestock animals, such as cows, pigs, and sheep, release methane gas by expelling wind from their bodies. One cow can produce up to sixty liters of methane each day. Methane gas is the second most common greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Many environmental experts now believe that methane is more responsible for global warming than carbon dioxide. It is estimated that 25 percent of all methane released into the atmosphere comes from farm animals.          Another way in which meat production affects the environment is through the use of water and land. Twenty-five hundred gallons of water are needed to produce one pound of beef, whereas twenty gallons of water are needed to produce one pound of wheat. One acre of farmland used for raising livestock can produce 250 pounds of beef. One acre of farmland used for crop production can produce 40,000 pounds of potatoes, 30,000 pounds of carrots, or 50,000 pounds of tomatoes.                   Many people now see the benefits of switching to a vegetarian diet, not just for health reasons, but also for the vital role it plays in protecting the environment. However, some nutritionists advise against switching to a totally strict vegetarian, or vegan, diet. They believe a vegan diet, which excludes all products from animal sources, including cheese, eggs, and milk, can be deficient in many of the necessary vitamins and minerals our bodies need.       Today, many people know that it is important to take better care of their bodies, and to use the earth's resources more efficiently. As this understanding spreads, more and more people may realize that to help the environment, and for the human race to survive, they will need to become vegetarian.  
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄElizabeth Henderson1 bought a new cellphone that nearly drove her crazy. ‚ÄúOver an eight-month period, I returned the phone to the store about 10 times, wrote letters, and called the manufacturer, but the phone continued to strike,‚Äù said Henderson. At last, she filed1 a complaint, and after three months, the manufacturer agreed to refund2 the amount3 she paid for it, pay her legal4 fees5, and allow her to keep the phone.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄFortunately6, Henderson‚Äôs problems were resolved7 to her satisfaction8. However, most unsatisfied9 consumers do not file or delay9 filing complaints. They just wish the manufacturer actively came to deal with their problems.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄResearch shows that consumers feel that complaining is too time-consuming10, believe that nothing will come of it, do not know how or where to complain, or think what they will get back is too little or the problem too unimportant. „ÄÄ„ÄÄBut no matter how small your concern is, the experts11 say that you should do something. Expressing that you are dissatisfied8 does not have to take a lot of time. Although writing a letter is one method of expressing your concerns, there are other things to try. Here are a few creative ways to tell a company you are not happy: „ÄÄ„ÄÄSome websites allow you to read complaints filed by other consumers, look at consumer warnings12, and get consumer reports. One of the easiest ways to send a complaint is to surf13 over to www.planetfeedback.com. This site14 helps you write a letter, delivers15 it to the right person, forwards16 copies to others, tracks the follow-up17 process, and records your results.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄYour letter alone may not be read, but many letters or e-mails expressing similar complaints may get noticed. Get everyone to write a letter. Furthermore, these letters should not be form18 letters and should be sent as a group.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄIf you are not getting results from the customer19 service department, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for the CEO2 or chairman20 of the board21. The president may not respond personally, but chances are that someone will respond‚Äîespecially if you team up with other unhappy customers.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThis can be expensive, but consumers can buy advertising on television or in newspapers to let more people know about the problem. Also, contact22 the loca2l3 media24 to find out if they have a ‚Äúconsumer watchdog3‚Äù program that reports customer complaints.   „ÄÄ„ÄÄTo begin with, try the Consumer Protection Commission25 (www.cpc. gov.tw). It provides consumer tips and resources for complaint resolution. Also, visit the Consumer‚Äôs Foundation26 (www.consumers.org.tw), which offers consumers valuable information and resources to help unhappy customers. Consumers can expect these organizations to investigate27 and help with the resolution process.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄOf course the best way to have a good experience after buying something is to practice smart shopping habits from the start. Find out whether anyone has filed complaints before and make sure you read the fine print4 before signing any deal. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄResearchers say that body language accounts2 for 80 percent of what people communicate. When words and body language don‚Äôt say the same thing, you should believe what you see over what you hear.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄOf all the nonverbal3 signals that people send, facial expressions are the most common‚Äîand the most complex4. Researchers say that the human face can produce some 7,000 different expressions. People use hundreds of these facial expressions every day, conveying5 shades of meaning with subtle differences in the curve6 of a lip or the angle7 of an eyebrow8. „ÄÄ„ÄÄResearchers who have studied facial expressions have found that many of them reveal9 certain basic human emotions, one at a time or in various combinations. When you are surprised, you open your eyes, nostrils10, and  mouth wide. When you are afraid, your eyes are wide open,  too, but your facial muscles11 are tense12.  When you are sad, the corners of your  mouth turn down. You show disgust13  by scrunching1 up your mouth and  wrinkling14 your nose and brow‚Äîan  expression that may have begun  when early people tasted something terrible. In anger15, your eyes narrow16 , and you look as if you are about to snar 1l7. When you are happy, you smile‚Äîyour mouth curves up, and the corners of your eyes wrinkle. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThese basic expressions seem to be part of a universa1l8 nonverbal language. People from all over the world, with very different cultural backgrounds, recognize them and generally19 interpret them in the same way. In one study, for example, researchers photographed the facial expressions of a group of Americans and members of a New Guinea2 tribe, and then showed the photos of each group to the other. The groups were able to interpret the expressions correctly20 80 percent of the time. „ÄÄ„ÄÄBabies are born knowing how to form many facial expressions. In the first few months of life, they learn how to use them. For example, when a baby smiles, adults just can‚Äôt help smiling back and gently touching and holding the baby, so babies learn that smiles bring good things. That strengthens the happy feeling of a smile. Researchers have found that babies who get lots of smiles also smile a lot. But if no one smiles back, babies gradually smile less and less. „ÄÄ„ÄÄSome researchers think that certain facial expressions may actually help create the emotions. You can try this out for yourself. If you are feeling a bit low, put on a really big smile and hold it for a few minutes. Do you start to feel happy? One possible explanation for this is that the tightening of facial muscles affects the circulation21 of blood to the brain, and that in turn affects emotions.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄScientists are learning more about nonverbal communication all the time. Knowing about body language is useful for everyone. The more you study facial expressions, posture22, and other nonverbal cues23, the easier it is to make sense of them. Then you will be better able to understand what people are really saying‚Äîeven when they don‚Äôt want you to know! 
°@°@Bite into a big red apple, and the flavor will explode in your mouth. Crisp , juicy, sweet and tart1 at the same time°Xyou recognize it at once. Without flavor like this, food would be boring indeed. This is why hundreds of years ago, Christopher Columbus2 and other explorers2 sailed3 across4 the seas to find spices5 to season6 their food.  °@°@Everyone has his or her favorite flavors: the sunny flavor of fresh-squeezed3 orange juice, the rich flavor of chocolate, the salty7 taste of potato chips8, the spicy5 flavor of a bowl of chili4, just to name a few. Flavor has always been important to people. °@Scientists used to think that basic tastes were perceived in separate9 areas of the tongue°Xsweet at the tip, salty at the sides, and so on. They now know that this is not true°Xeach taste bud10 can sense all the basic tastes but reacts differently to each one. However, taste may be stronger in one part of the tongue than in another. Besides, the sense of taste can vary11 a great deal12 from one person to another. Some people have more taste buds than others°Xand thus13 they have a more sensitive sense of taste. °@°@Research has also turned up some other interesting facts about taste and flavor. For example, it is unlikely that you will ever lose your sense of taste. The body is constantly14 replacing15 the receptors5 in the taste buds. In fact, the average receptor is in use only ten or eleven days before a new one develops to take its place. Thus, unlike sight or hearing, the sense of taste stays sharp16 well into old age. Older people sometimes say that their food does not taste as good as it used to, but this is rarely because the sense of taste has become weak. Instead, the other senses involved in the full experience of flavor°Xespecially the sense of smell°Xmay not be as strong as they once were. °@°@Actually, the ability to recognize the basic tastes is present at birth, and so are certain taste preferences18. For example, newborn babies like sweet things and do not like bitter things. Most people also naturally like salty tastes. In fact, there are sound19 reasons for what people like and do not like, according to scientists. Sweet foods generally contain sugars that the body can use to produce energy, and salt is necessary for many body functions20. But many poisonous21 plants taste bitter. Thousands of years ago, when people gathered22 their food from the wild23, a natural love of salt and sugar and a natural dislike24 of bitter flavors helped them survive25.  °@°@On the other hand, people usually like flavors they grew up with and distrust new ones. For example, dishes that are seasoned with hot peppers7 and other spices are popular in Latin America and some other regions. Very young children do not eat them, but at the age of about 5 or 6, they start to follow their parents and enjoy these spicy foods. However, in many northern26 countries, even adults rarely experience hot, spicy foods. While people stay with flavors they know, things do change. For example, recently, spicier and fuller flavors have become popular. °@°@So this is what taste is all about. Next time when you taste anything, delicious or strange, do not forget to make good use of the gifts from God°Xtaste buds°Xand enjoy all kinds of flavors. 
Unit 3  The Tao: People of the Sea. 	Surrounded by water on all sides and rich in marine resources, Taiwan is closely connected with the ocean. In addition to the fact that seafood plays an important part in our daily diet, we also rely on sea transportation for trading. However, few of us value our ties with the ocean as much as the Tao do. The Tao are the indigenous people who inhabit Orchid Island. Among all the tribes of Taiwan, the Tao may be the only one that is genuinely in great awe of the ocean. 	The reason why the ocean is of such great significance to the Tao people lies in the geographical environment of Orchid Island. The land being very rugged and infertile, the Tao people can only plant some crops that are easy to grow, such as taros and yams, as their staple crops. To maintain an adequate intake of protein, they must paddle off to sea to catch fish. Over the years, the Tao have developed a philosophy of fishing, which is intended for both bountiful catches and the conservation of marine life. For example, they are used to catching fish with their bare hands, and they respectfully follow their fishing calendar which corresponds to the movements of ocean currents. Every year from March to June, the waters around Orchid Island are frequented by schools of flying fish brought by the Kuroshio Current. This period of time, also known as the flying fish season, has become the principal fishing season for the Tao. 	The Tao people regard flying fish as a gift from their god, so the occasion of catching flying fish has been highly valued. Traditionally, during the flying fish season, tribesmen from different families have to form fishing groups and live together, following numerous rules about diet and living. Before the fishing groups set sail to fish, the members utilize their exceptional wood-carving skills to build plank boats. In order to ward off evil spirits and pray for blessings, they paint certain totems on their boats, including shapes of humans, waves, and concentric circles. These elaborately decorated boats are sacred to the Tao people and are their most precious cultural heritage. Furthermore, the Tao people hold many different ceremonies throughout the entire flying fish season to show their gratitude to their god and to ensure a good catch. Their traditional music and dances also reveal strong imagery of the ocean. Clearly, the Tao have created a unique, ocean-oriented culture. 	As technology has advanced, the lifestyle of the Tao has changed to some degree. The plank boats that they used to sail are now being replaced with engine-powered rafts. The development of the local tourist industry is also presenting a threat to the local environment, not to mention the thousands of tons of nuclear waste stored on this island. Nevertheless, many of the Tao people still endeavor to preserve both their living environment and their culture. Without a writing system, these people pass on their wisdom via narration. Hopefully, flying fish will continue riding the ocean waves to Orchid Island, and the Tao°¶s god will keep on looking after these people of the sea. °XBy J.P. Raptor
Unit 8  Always Open, Always Convenient. 	Convenience stores are definitely a common sight in Taiwan. In Taiwan°¶s bustling cities, it is not surprising at all to see two convenience stores on one block. Even in the quiet suburbs, there always seems to be at least one convenience store open for business. Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then, that Taiwan has the highest density of convenience stores in the world. Another common sight in Taiwan is that convenience stores are more often than not crowded with people, especially at mealtimes. Some people, for instance, never start their day without first stopping at a convenience store for a cup of coffee. Clearly, convenience stores have become very successful by weaving themselves into the fabric of everyday life in Taiwan. 	One important reason for the popularity of convenience stores in Taiwan is the wide variety of services that they offer. These services allow people to save time when they run errands, since they can take care of their daily needs in one convenient place. In addition to buying different types of food and drinks, people can pay their phone bills, parking fees, and even traffic fines. What°¶s more, they can withdraw money from an ATM in these stores as well. With a hand °ßpay-on-pickup°® service, people can shop on the Internet and then collect what they have purchased at a convenience store nearby. Also, people are able to pre-order many different items, ranging from local cuisine to concert tickets. Best of all, all of these services are available at all times because convenience stores are open twenty-four hours a day. Without a doubt, the services that convenience stores offer have changed people°¶s shopping habits. 	In fact, there are several clever marketing strategies behind these services. First, the marketing experts of most convenience-store chains understand that the more often people go to their stores, the more likely they are to buy something. Offering many services, according to these marketing experts, creates more opportunities for convenience stores to attract customers. As a result, whatever customers°¶ purposes may be when they walk into a store, they will probably end up buying something. For example, a freelance designer might stop by a convenience store to make some copies and then get a sandwich before walking up to the counter. Second, people get the impression from advertisements that convenience stores can take care of their daily needs. Many people, thus, tend to consider convenience stores reliable, particularly because these stores provide various kinds of supplies. Whatever people may need, convenience stores have these items stacked on their shelves already. Finally, convenience stores combine regular services with special sales promotions once in a while. Because of this, some people are tempted and motivated to pop into convenience stores and purchase more products. These strategies stimulate consumption and have become essential ingredients of the huge success of convenience stores in Taiwan. 	Apparently, the ever-growing convenience-store industry in Taiwan has been built upon a win-win arrangement for both the stores and their customers. Convenience stores help people get what they want and save their precious time. In return, these customers usually purchase more products from these stores, and these stores, consequently, earn more profits. This mutually beneficial relationship certainly goes a long way toward explaining why convenience stores in Taiwan are always open and always convenient.  °XBy Theodore Pigott
