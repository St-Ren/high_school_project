Lesson Two  Sounds of Moonlight. °@°@In the middle of his life, Ludwig van Beethoven1, the German musician1, slowly began to lose his hearing. Beethoven was afraid he would have to stop writing music. People tell the following story about how he found the courage to continue. No one knows to this day whether the story is true or not. °@°@ °@°@It was a cold winter night in 1801. The city of Vienna2, Austria3, lay sleeping under a full moon. °@°@ °@°@A young man hurried home through a strange section2 of the city. He was Ludwig van Beethoven, a famous composer3. °@°@ °@°@Suddenly Beethoven stopped. From a nearby4 cottage5 came the sound of a piano. In fact, Beethoven recognized one of his own works. But it was not being played very well. °@°@ °@°@After a moment the music stopped. Then he heard the sound of crying. °ßI can°¶t get it right,°® sobbed6 a girl°¶s voice. °ßI°¶ll never get it right.°® °@°@ °@°@Beethoven knocked at the cottage door. A young man opened it. Inside, the room was lit7 by only a few candles8. Beethoven could barely make out an old piano and a girl sitting in front of it. °@°@ °@°@°®I heard music and then crying,°® said Beethoven. °ßCan I help in any way?°® °@°@ °@°@The girl sighed9. °ßI have been trying all night to play this piece of music. But I°¶m afraid I°¶ll never get it right.°® °@°@ °@°@The girl was embarrassed10. She told Beethoven that she and her brother had little money for music lessons. But she had been to a concert11 and had heard this music. She and her brother knew that she would never play well unless she could hear good musicians play. °@°@ °@°@Beethoven smiled. °ßWould you like to have a concert now?°® he asked. °ßI am a musician also.°® °@°@ °@°@°ßThat is very good of you, sir,°® replied the girl. °ßBut the piano is old, and we have no sheet12 music.°® °@°@ °@°@This surprised Beethoven. °ßNo sheet music?°® he asked. °ßBut you were playing....°® Then he fell13 silent. He suddenly understood why the piano was in the dark. The girl was blind. She couldn°¶t read a note14 from a sheet of music. She was playing his music from memory15. °@°@ °@°@Beethoven°¶s eyes filled with tears. He sat down at the piano and began to play. He played all the pieces of music that he knew. He played with all the feeling and skill16 that he had. °@°@ °@°@Finally the candles burned out. Beethoven went to the window and swept17 back the curtains18. Moonlight flooded19 the room. It covered the bare20 floor and furniture21 with silver light. Then Beethoven started to play something new. He tried to describe for the girl what the moonlight was like. The notes filled the room with flowing22 sound. He had never played so well. The music grew softer23. When it finally stopped, the girl whispered, °ßYou must be Beethoven. No one else could play so well.°® Her brother added, °ßWe will never forget this kindness24.°® °@°@ °@°@That night Beethoven went home and finished the music he had played. It came to be known as °ßMoonlight Sonata4°® and is still played today. A few years later Beethoven started to grow deaf25. Soon he could hardly26 hear. Sounds seemed to be coming through a blanket that got thicker and thicker. °@°@ °@°@Finally Beethoven could not hear a single note. But still he kept on writing music. He heard the notes in his head. Some of his greatest works were written after he had become deaf. It may be that the blind girl°¶s struggle to play the piano that night gave him the courage not to give up. 
Lesson Nine   Going Home. °@°@They were going to Florida°Xthree boys and three girls°Xand when they boarded the bus, they were carrying sandwiches and wine1 in paper bags, dreaming of golden beaches and sea tides2 as the gray cold of New York vanished behind them. °@°@ °@°@As the bus rumbled1 south, they began to notice Vingo. He sat in front of them, dressed in a plain3, ill-fitting2 suit4, never moving, his dusty face masking5 his age. He chewed6 the inside of his lip a lot, frozen into some personal cocoon3 of silence7. °@°@ °@°@Deep into the night, outside Washington, the bus pulled into a roadside restaurant, and everybody got off except Vingo. He sat rooted8 in his seat, and the young people began to wonder about him, trying to imagine his life: perhaps he was a sea captain9, a runaway4 from his wife, an old soldier going home. When they went back to the bus, one of the girls sat beside him and introduced herself. °@°@ °@°@°ßWe°¶re going to Florida,°® she said brightly10. °ßI hear it°¶s beautiful.°® °@°@ °@°@°ßIt is,°® he said quietly, as if remembering something he had tried to forget. °@°@ °@°@°ßWant some wine?°® she said. He smiled and took a swig5. He thanked her and retreated11 again into his silence. After a while, she went back to the others, and Vingo nodded in sleep. °@°@ °@°@In the morning, they awoke outside another restaurant, and this time Vingo went in. The girl insisted12 that he join them. He seemed very shy13, and ordered black coffee and smoked nervously as the young people chattered14 about sleeping on beaches. When they returned to the bus, the girl sat with Vingo again, and after a while, slowly and painfully15, he told his story. He had been in jail16 in New York for the past four years, and now he was going home. °@°@ °@°@°ßAre you married?°® °@°@ °@°@°ßI don°¶t know.°® °@°@ °@°@°ßYou don°¶t know?°® she said. °@°@ °@°@°ßWell, when I was in the can6 I wrote to my wife,°® he said. °ßI told her that I was going to be away for a long time, and that if she couldn°¶t stand it, if the kids kept asking questions, if it hurt too much, well, she could just forget me. I°¶d understand. Get a new guy, I said°Xshe°¶s a wonderful woman, really something°Xand forget about me. I told her she didn°¶t have to write me. And she didn°¶t. Not for three and a half years.°® °@°@ °@°@°ßAnd you°¶re going home now, not knowing?°® °@°@ °@°@°ßYeah,°® he said shyly. °ßWell, last week, when I was sure the parole17 was coming through, I wrote her again. There°¶s a big oak tree just as you come into town. I told her that if she°¶d take me back, she should put a yellow handkerchief on the tree, and I°¶d get off and come home. If she didn°¶t want me, forget it°Xno handkerchief, and I°¶d go on through.°® °@°@ °@°@°ßWow,°® the girl said. °ßWow.°® °@°@ °@°@She told the others, and soon all of them were in it, caught up in the approach of Vingo°¶s hometown, looking at the pictures he showed them of his wife and three children°Xthe woman handsome in a plain way, the children still unformed7 in the cracked, much-handled18 snapshots8. °@°@ °@°@Now they were 20 miles from the town, and the young people took over window seats on the right side, waiting for the approach of the great oak tree. The bus acquired19 a dark, hushed20 mood, full of the silence of absence21 and lost years. Vingo stopped looking, tightening22 his face into the ex-con°¶s9 mask, as if fortifying23 himself against still another disappointment. °@°@ °@°@Then it was ten miles, and then five. Then, suddenly, all of the young people were up out of their seats, screaming and shouting and crying, doing small dances of exultation24. All except Vingo. °@°@ °@°@Vingo sat there stunned25, looking at the oak tree. It was covered with yellow handkerchiefs°X20 of them, 30 of them, maybe hundreds, a tree that stood like a banner26 of welcome billowing27 in the wind. As the young people shouted, the old con rose from his seat and made his way to the front of the bus to go home. 
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄHave you ever felt that it is really hard to communicate with friends and companions of the opposite sex? Actually, most misunderstandings between men and women stem from different conversational styles. According to the book You Just Don‚Äôt Understand‚ÄîWomen and Men in Conversation, the language women use is quite different from that used by men because they take different approaches to communication. The following are examples of the most common conflicts between males and females.   ‚Ä¢Ruling vs. Negotiation   „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhile in their car, a girl turned to her boyfriend and asked, ‚ÄúWould you like to stop for a coffee?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, thanks,‚Äù he answered. So they didn‚Äôt stop. The result? The girl, who had wanted to stop, became annoyed. But the boy felt frustrated because his girlfriend hadn‚Äôt said what she wanted. In fact, the girl was asking the question not to get an instant decision, but to begin a negotiation. She didn‚Äôt realize that when her boyfriend said no, he was just expressing his preference, not making a ruling.  „ÄÄ‚Ä¢Advice vs. Understanding„ÄÄ „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen Eve confided* to her boyfriend, Mark, that she was distressed because she was fat, Mark answered, ‚ÄúYou should go on a diet.‚Äù The comment bothered her. ‚ÄúI know you think I am fat, but I am not going on a diet.‚Äù Eve thought Mark was advising her to lose weight because he agreed with the statement that she was fat. Mark was hurt and puzzled. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care how much she weighs. It doesn‚Äôt bother me at all.‚Äù To many men, a complaint means a challenge to come up with a solution. But often women are looking for emotional support instead of solutions. In this case, all Eve wanted was sympathy, not advice.  „ÄÄ‚Ä¢Independence vs. Intimacy„ÄÄ „ÄÄ„ÄÄOn Josh‚Äôs way to meet Linda for dinner, he ran across his best friend Brian. He invited Brian to have dinner with them. When both Josh and Brian showed up together at the restaurant, Linda felt upset because Josh had made the decision without checking with her first. Linda always checked with Josh first before she made a decision, which showed that her life was intertwined* with his. Josh, however, did not want to ask his girlfriend for permission just to invite a friend to dinner. He felt he would be losing his freedom to act on his own. What caused the conflict? Women place more emphasis on closeness and giving support whereas men tend to focus more on independence.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄIf we can‚Äôt see that the two sexes have different communication styles, we may sometimes draw unfair conclusions: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre self-centered*,‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt care about me.‚Äù But when we learn the opposite sex‚Äôs ways of talking, we can bridge the communication gap and take a giant step toward genuine understanding. 
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄWould you like to live on a tropical island for six months, soak up the sun, swim with the fishes, and get paid a salary of 1, Australian dollars (US$,) for doing all these? You may have trouble believing this, but that is exactly what 3-year-old Ben Southall, an adventurer and fundraiser* from Britain, had to do when he won the ‚ÄúBest Job in the World‚Äù contest. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn January 2, Tourism Queensland* started a contest to find an ‚Äúisland caretaker*‚Äù for Hamilton Island* in the Great Barrier Reef* in Queensland, Australia. Applications for the job came from all over the world‚Äîover 3, people from 2 countries applied for the position. Applicants had to submit a 6-second video expressing why they were the best candidates for the job. Some applicants chose to talk about their work, while others decided to show their bizarre* side. For example, one applicant from Singapore put on a wetsuit and quizzed people about the Great Barrier Reef on the streets and on trains. Southall chose to show his fun and adventurous side. In his video, he told about how he had travelled all over Africa, climbed mountains, gone bungee jumping*, and even ridden an ostrich*. His video was humorous and straight to the point, winning him the chance to compete as one of the finalists*. „ÄÄ„ÄÄFor the final stage, 1 competitors were selected by a jury; one of them, an interpreter from Taiwan, was a ‚Äúwild card*‚Äù applicant chosen by popular vote. The judges considered it vital for the winner to have a great enthusiasm for nature and a true passion for Queensland. They were also looking for someone who was creative, funny, outgoing, and great at communicating. Southall possessed all these qualities and also managed to impress the judges in the final stage, thus securing his place as the top candidate. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAfter he was declared the winner of the contest, Southall became a celebrity overnight. His daily responsibilities as the caretaker of the island involved exploring the plants and the wildlife, feeding the fish, and performing other interesting duties. He also had to share his experiences and thoughts with the world through weekly posts on his blog*, which was widely read by people interested in the beauty of the island. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAlthough his job may seem like a vacation to many, Southall said that it was not as easy as it might sound; in fact, he had a busy schedule on the island and even encountered dangerous situations. Just days away from the end of his job as a caretaker, he was stung by a poisonous Irukandji jellyfish*. Fortunately, he was treated immediately before his condition worsened. Despite this minor setback*, he was soon back on his feet, resuming his routine activities. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAfter his six-month stay on the island came to an end, Southall became the ambassador for Tourism Queensland. He travelled the world to promote and praise the beauty of the area. He was even interviewed by Oprah Winfrey* over Skype*. In his interviews, he said that his experience gave him a better understanding of how important the Great Barrier Reef‚Äôs ecosystem is and why people should preserve it by adopting a more eco-friendly lifestyle. He also urged people to expand their horizons, try new things, and develop a global view: ‚ÄúTake on the world today, dream a little and book that flight you‚Äôve been thinking about taking.‚Äù 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄIn her room, Kate is sitting in front of her laptop*, busy typing her report. Halfway through, she surfs the Internet for some information she needs while downloading a new online game from a website. She clicks the mouse with her right hand, her other hand picking up the phone to answer an incoming call. Talking happily, Kate directs her attention back to the computer and starts to play the game she has finished downloading. She keeps switching between tasks like this, with music playing all the while on her MP player*. „ÄÄ„ÄÄLife today moves faster than ever. Like many other people around the world, Kate uses new technology to make the maximum use of her time. In today‚Äôs world, people are becoming experts at multitasking, that is, the art of doing several things at once. Electronic multitasking is not new, of course: people have been driving cars and listening to the radio at the same time for more than eighty years. But there is no denying that this phenomenon has become much more widespread and much more intense in the era of Web-enabled* computers. „ÄÄ„ÄÄNowadays, new technology makes many daily tasks more efficient. E-mail, Skype, portable laptop computers, cell phones, MP players, and other entertainment devices such as tablets* and eBook* systems all make it easier to communicate with others and get information quickly. But when technology allows us to ‚Äúsave‚Äù time on one task, we often fill the time saved with another activity. As a result, more and more peopleÔºçmembers of the younger generation in particularÔºçare dividing their attention between multiple tasks performed at the same time. But is multitasking a good habit or a harmful one? „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe obvious advantage of multitasking is that it makes performing daily tasks more efficient. With the help of those high-tech* devices, we are able to access information and communicate more quickly and easily. But increased multitasking has its dangers. Researchers warn that the mental habit of dividing one‚Äôs attention into many small slices can reduce the quality and depth of one‚Äôs reasoning. With less practice in sustained concentration on one issue, a person might gradually lose the ability to think through a complex problem or do creative work. His or her understanding of the world could become more superficial. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAnother danger is that multitasking gadgets* can influence our relationships. A professor at UCLA‚Äôs* Center on Everyday Lives of Families says that these devices enable family members to retreat into their own individual worlds: ‚ÄúWhen the working parent comes home at night, his or her spouse and the kids are so absorbed in what they‚Äôre doing that they don‚Äôt give the arriving parent the time of day.‚Äù  „ÄÄ„ÄÄBoth researchers and the public debate the advantages and disadvantages of multitasking. On the one hand, we can enjoy increased speed and efficiency; on the other hand, we may be unable to concentrate and possibly damage our relationships. As in other areas of modern life, people must learn how to strike a balance between both the advantages and the potentially harmful impact of all the new technology. 
A World of Hats.      Humans first wore hats to protect themselves. The first hats were probably made of leaves and bark tied together. But even with this simple design, the first hats served their purpose. They helped our ancestors stay dry. Today, there is a hat for all seasons°Xand all reasons.       The national hat of France is the beret. It came from the Basque people, who lived in the south of France. When Frenchmen saw how great these hats looked, they started wearing them, too. The beret is popular because it is able to say so many things, depending on how it is worn. Worn facing forward and high on the head, the beret looks proud. This is the way a soldier wears one. But, worn lower and turned to the side, a beret looks playful and cute. It°¶s the perfect addition to a schoolgirl°¶s uniform. Many painters and musicians love to wear berets. In fact, people often associate the beret with artists. The beret°¶s style is loved by people all around the world.     The hat that best represents Mexico is the sombrero. Today, it is worn mostly by the members of mariachi bands, but this was not always so. To understand the sombrero, imagine you are a Mexican farmer long ago. In the fields the work is backbreaking and there isn°¶t any shade in which to rest. So, you invent a hat with a wide brim to supply all the shade you need. Naming this hat isn°¶t hard. You simply use the Spanish word for shade! °@°@Not all hats are worn for protection from the weather or for fashion. Some are worn for religious reasons. Jewish men and boys wear yarmulkes. This small hat is about the size of a teacup saucer and covers only the top of the head. It is worn to show respect for God. The Jewish Bible says, °ßCover your head in order that the fear of heaven may be upon you.°® Religious Jews won°¶t leave the house without one. °@°@Then there is the turban. This special head covering is worn by male Sikhs. Their religion demands that they grow beards, carry knives, and never cut their hair. So, to keep it tidy, these Northern Indian men wrap their hair in sheets that can be up to forty-five meters long. Then they wind the sheets around their heads. The result is a unique head covering and a religious symbol that is known around the world.     What you put on your head tells others something about you before you even say a word. So if you have a message for the world, why not let a hat say it for you?  --from English 4U, December 2005
It's a "Punderful" Life.      Language is fun. Everyone who speaks and listens and reads and writes is involved with the natural playfulness of language.      In English, much of that play takes the form of punning, as in this verse, which has fun with the two meanings of the word weather and its similarity in sound to whether: Whether the weather is good, Or whether the weather is not; Whether the weather is cold, Or whether the weather is hot; We'll weather the weather, Whatever the weather, Whether we like it or not!      As an English learner, you probably have chanted songs like this one: A sailor went to C-C-C, To see what he could C-C-C, But all that he could C-C-C Was the bottom of a great blue C-C-C.      Verses like this are children's first attempts to put into memorable forms their pleasure in discovering that the same sound can suggest two or three different meanings- like C, sea, and see.      Words and sounds that spark two or more meanings are called puns. A pun has been defined as a play upon words, and a prey upon words. You probably recognize many of these traditional riddles:  What's black and white and red (read) all over? A newspaper.  What kind of rooms have no walls? Mushrooms.  What happened to the boy who drank eight Cokes? He burped Seven-Up.      Here's a game riddled with punch lines. Guess the punch lines of these popular jokes. You'll find the answers below:  Why did Silly Billy tiptoe past the medicine cabinet? He didn't want to wake up the .sleeping pills.  Where do elephants store their clothes? In their trunks.      You can also find instances of punch lines on posters and placards on which people manipulate words for a humorous purpose.  At a tire store: Time to re-tire.  On the wall of a dentist's office: Always be true to your teeth, or they will be false to you.  In a garden shop: Lighten up your garden. Plant bulbs.       When you read the puns in the verses, riddles, and signs above, can you feel the natural playfulness of language? Do you laugh at the punch lines? If so, congratulations! With a little imagination and a sense of humor, you can also make up your own puns. Look for ideas in the verses you read, the riddles you hear, and the signs you see. Why not start with a sign for a restaurant, a candy store, or even your school? Once you do, you'll have more fun with English! 
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄAll of us have experienced some symptoms of stress1. Whether we have stomach problems or difficulty sleeping, at some point our stress may cause some uncomfortable reactions. Sure, stress is a normal part of life, but it‚Äôs  clear that too much stress can be bad for our health.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄStress can be put into two categories2: mental or physical. Mental stress is caused by such things as worries over schoolwork or a loved one‚Äôs health, or loss of a loved one. Physical stress can be a result of too little sleep, poor diet3, or the effects of an illness.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄBasically, when dealing4 with a stressful1  situation5, your body will react so it can quickly  and effectively deal with the situation. But  if you are in this condition6 over many  hours of each day, and if stress cannot  be addressed in a healthy way, your  body will suffer7 and may experience  such health problems as high blood8  pressure9 and heart disease. „ÄÄ„ÄÄTo be sure, all of us handle10 stress in our own  ways. But there are some healthy ways to deal with  whatever11 stress comes your way. Here are some  suggestions to help you reduce and handle stress. Be realistic. If you feel some problems are too difficult to deal with, learn to refuse requests! You may be taking on more responsibility than you can handle.  Take off the superman/woman costume12. No one is perfect.  Don‚Äôt hesitate13 to give yourself a break. Reach a balance about what is really necessary14 to do and ask for help.  Don‚Äôt look too far ahead. Sometimes, or even every day, your work can seem out of control. If this happens, focus on one task at a time.  Be flexible15. When you know you‚Äôre right, stand firm16, but be calm  and reasonable. You should also listen to others and compromise17 if possible.  Take time off. Schedule time to do the things you enjoy.  Exercise. Exercise is an effective way to address many health conditions. Twenty to thirty minutes throughout the day of some type18 of exercise may relieve much stress.  Lead a healthy life. Good nutrition can make a difference. Pay attention to your diet: the food you eat will influence the way you feel. Communicate. Share your feelings by talking to someone. You may not be the only one having a lousy19 day.  Be a volunteer20. Helping others is a great way to get your worries out of your mind and turn your energy into something positive.  Consider asking for help. Please don‚Äôt feel uneasy21 when this  is suggested. It‚Äôs not a sign of weakness22 to get help, but a sign of strength because you‚Äôre helping yourself.  Eat chocolate. There is no scientific evidence23 that chocolate reduces stress, but it sure is delicious! It is important to treat  yourself every now and then. Just a little bit can go a long way.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe bottom line2 is this: please don‚Äôt let stress ruin24 your day.  For more information25 on ways to reduce stress, please speak with a health care professional. 
Unit 1  The Chain of Love. °@°@He was driving his battered old car home on a country road one evening. Since the closure of the Levi°¶s factory, he°¶d been unemployed. With winter raging on, the chill had finally hit home. °@°@It was starting to get dark. Although snow flurries drifted in the dim light of day, he could still notice an elderly lady stranded by the roadside. Apparently, she needed some help. So, he pulled up in front of her Mercedes-Benz and got out. When he approached her, she was worried. °ßNo one stopped to help for the last hour or so,°® she thought to herself. °ßIs he going to rob me?°® Realizing that she was frightened, he said quickly, °ßI°¶m here to help, ma°¶am. Why don°¶t you wait in the car? It°¶s freezing outside. By the way, my name is Joe.°® °@°@All she had was a flat tire, but for an old lady, that was bad enough. While Joe was changing the tire, the lady rolled down her window and began to talk to him. She thanked him for coming to her aid. Joe just smiled as he put the flat tire into the trunk. °@°@She asked him how much she owed him. Joe, however, never thought twice about helping others. He certainly never thought about any kind of payment or reward. To him, this wasn°¶t a job, but rather a way to help someone in need, just like those who had given him a hand in the past. He told the elderly lady that if she really wanted to repay him, she could help someone else that was in need. °@°@He waited until she started her car and drove off. It had been a cold and depressing day, but he felt content as he headed for home. °@°@A few miles down the road, the lady saw a small, shabby caf?. She went in to grab a bite and take the chill off before making the last leg of her trip home. °@°@A waitress came over and brought the elderly lady a clean towel for her wet hair. The waitress had a sweet smile, one that even being on her feet for an entire day couldn°¶t erase. The lady noticed that the waitress was heavily pregnant. She wondered how a person like this waitress could be so thoughtful to a perfect stranger. Then she remembered Joe. °@°@Finally, the lady finished her meal. When the waitress went to get the lady°¶s change for the hundred-dollar bill, the lady slid out the door. When the waitress came back, the lady was no longer in sight. To the surprise of the waitress, the lady had paid almost fifty times as much as the price of the meal. Then, the waitress saw something written on a napkin. Tears blurred her vision as she read what the lady had written. It said, °ßSomeone once helped me out in the way I°¶m helping you. If you want to pay me back, don°¶t let the chain of love end with you.°® °@°@That night, as the waitress lay awake in bed, she thought about the money and what the lady had written. °ßHow would she know that we need money, especially with our baby due next month?°® she wondered. Her husband, who was worried sick about their future, was lying beside her. She gave him a soft kiss and whispered, °ßEverything will be all right. I love you, Joe.°® °@°@°XAdapted from °ßThe Chain of Love.°® 
Unit 3  Do You Often Procrastinate? °@°@Following a schedule and doing things on time is extremely important in today°¶s busy world. As a result, using time effectively is a practical skill that everyone must master. Catching a bus, getting to school on time, and even meeting friends all require good time management. Unfortunately, many people fail to acquire such a skill, but rather tend to put off doing things until it°¶s too late. °@°@In fact, everyone procrastinates sometimes. Statistics show that ninety percent of university students usually put off studying for tests until the night before. Even worse, twenty-five percent of university students can be defined as chronic procrastinators. This more serious form of procrastination can even result in a student dropping out of school. Students who persistently delay doing their assignments usually get further and further behind with their studies. Before long, they feel completely overwhelmed. For some chronic procrastinators, the only way to solve their problem is to quit school. °@°@However, how does such chronic procrastination develop? Studies have suggested that there are three main reasons behind this. First, many students have poor time-management skills and often expect to do too much in a short time. They often end up finding themselves defeated and therefore put things off over and over again. Second, many chronic procrastinators think what they are assigned to do is so boring that they have difficulty concentrating on this work. They often avoid doing something because they have no interest in it. Third, many procrastinators are afraid of not being able to do their assignments well enough. These students often worry that their work will never be as good as it should be. In other words, it is because they try to do everything perfectly that they make themselves chronic procrastinators. °@°@Do you recognize any of these signs in yourself? If so, you may want to do something to break this bad habit. The following tips may come in handy if you want to stop procrastinating. °@°@First, list the things in life that are important to you, and then, make another list of the reasons why you are at school. Look at the two lists and see where they correspond. Is there anything you need to do at school to achieve a life goal? Second, once you have identified your goals, list them in order of priority. If you have several things to do, ask yourself, °ßWhich thing should I do first?°® As you have become more aware of what you need to do and when you need to do it, you will feel more in control and will be capable of completing tasks on time. Third, budget your time wisely. Create a schedule that allows sufficient time for accomplishing a goal. For example, your schedule should give you adequate time to study for tests. Finally, take the time to reward yourself. Tell yourself what you can enjoy after reaching your goals. When you accomplish a goal, do whatever helps you to relax, such as going to the movies or hanging out with friends. °@°@If you believe that you are a chronic procrastinator, you should try to get help as soon as possible. Talk to a counselor or whomever you can trust, and discuss the problem. If you are only a mild procrastinator, be sure to keep yourself motivated, but don°¶t worry too much. Remember°Xwe all procrastinate at times. °XAdapted from °ßAre You a Procrastinator?°® 
Unit 6  A Closer Look at Cultural Taboos. 	With the convenience of modern travel, destinations that used to take a long time to get to can now be reached quickly. Even °ßdistant°® countries may now seem closer. Yet, wherever you decide to go, the cultures of the places you visit may be somewhat different from the culture of your home country. Therefore, it is important that you adapt your behavior so that you don°¶t offend the locals. Here are some fundamental rules that will make communication easier, and your trip more enjoyable. 	First, never raise your voice with a view to making yourself understood. If you do not know the word for something in the local language, or cannot express whatever you think verbally, try drawing a picture or pointing to an object. Remember, though, pointing directly at a person can be highly offensive in some cultures. If you have to point at something, do so by holding the palm of your hand flat, facing upward, with your fingers outstretched and gesturing toward the object. In addition, it is advisable to learn some basic words and phrases in the local language before you set out on your journey. It is found useful for visitors to express gratitude and show politeness with the local words for °ßplease,°® °ßthank you,°® and °ßmay I,°® as well as basic greetings. 	Second, study the main religion of the country you plan to visit and learn about the taboos related to clothing, especially if you plan to look around sacred places. As a precaution, always bring conservative clothes, such as shirts and long trousers, that cover your shoulders and legs. 	Third, avoid sensitive topics of conversation. If a topic is sensitive in your own culture, it is perhaps also a sensitive one in other cultures. Feel free to show interest in the history and customs of the place you are visiting, but don°¶t make comments rashly. Otherwise, you may offend the local people. 	Also, keep in mind that in many cultures, it is thought a taboo to display affection in public. For instance, kissing in public places can be seen as unacceptable behavior. If you are unsure of how to behave, watch the local people and copy them°Xif they don°¶t do something in a certain way, you probably shouldn°¶t either. 	Last but not least, if you are staying with a host family and plan to give gifts, do some research in advance. The idea of a perfect gift varies enormously from culture to culture. In Chinese culture, for example, it is inappropriate to give fans or clocks. The Chinese word for °ßfan°® has a similar pronunciation to the pronunciation of °ßseparation,°® while the Chinese phrase for °ßgiving a clock°® sounds the same as the phrase meaning °ßholding a funeral.°® 	How to open gifts is also something treated very differently around the world. If you are in a Western country, do not be surprised when you see the receivers immediately tear off the wrapping paper from a gift in great excitement. They will then tell you how fantastic the gift is°Xwhether they genuinely like it or not! However, the situation is quite the reverse in most Asian countries, where it is considered impolite to open gifts in front of the giver. 	Whichever country you visit, you should always keep an open mind when it comes to the local customs. Avoid being critical; try instead to show respect for the values of the country you are in, even if you do not actually agree with them. °XAdapted from °ßAvoiding Cultural Taboos.°®
