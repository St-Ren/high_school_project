 　　Portuguese* sailors dubbed* Taiwan “Ilha Formosa*,” which means “beautiful island,” when they first saw it in 1. Since then, “Formosa” has been the unofficial name of Taiwan. But did you know that there is another Formosa on the banks of the Paraguay River* in Argentina*, on the other side of the earth? A group of 1th-century Spanish sailors was searching for the Sierra del Plata*, or “Mountain Range of Silver,” which they believed was hidden somewhere in South America. They saw a spot which they thought was so beautiful that they stopped to build a city there. Both the city and the province were named Formosa. 　　By remarkable coincidence, the province of Formosa in Argentina is antipodal* to the Formosa in Asia. This means these two places are located exactly opposite each other on the globe. Imagine a science fiction movie in which someone starts digging straight down into the ground in Taiwan. After he or she drills all the way through the earth, he or she will end up in Formosa, Argentina, on the other side! 　　Despite this special connection, the two Formosas are quite different in terms of their geography and climate. The island of Taiwan, shaped tens of millions of years ago by continuous tectonic* movements, lies in a complex area between two plates* and has a unique natural environment. Two-thirds of its 3, square kilometers are covered by mountains with dense forests, some of which rise hundreds of meters above sea level. The mountains, valleys, rivers, and reefs are home to hundreds of local species. This gives Taiwan a spectacular landscape and a wide variety of wildlife*. In contrast, most of Formosa, Argentina, which has a total area of 7, square kilometers, is relatively flat, covered with forests, grasslands*, and marshes*. In the eastern part of the country, it rains more, and thus there are forests and streams that are populated* with unique types of animals. The rest of Formosa is drier, especially in the winter, though the western region is heavily forested. 　　As for their economies, the two Formosas also present us with a clear contrast. While Taiwan used to be a relatively unknown place whose main economic activities were rice farming and fishing, it has developed at an impressive speed in the last few decades. Present-day Taiwan is renowned worldwide for its lively economy and advanced information technology and industry. On the other hand, Formosa is one of the poorest provinces in Argentina, mainly due to its history and climate. Its economy is primarily based on cattle-raising and other agricultural activities such as growing cotton and fruit—bananas in particular. Ranching* is especially important to the economy. The total number of cattle in Formosa exceeds 1. million head, more than three times the size of its human population. 　　Due in part to the government’s emphasis on tourism, Taiwan is now known around the world for its great natural beauty and its friendly people. It is now a destination which appeals to tourists from all over the world. In contrast, Argentina’s Formosa has never been a popular tourist destination. However, with today’s advanced information technology and airplanes, more people will be able to get to know this beautiful place. 　　Thanks to the Portuguese and Spanish sailors who explored many different parts of the world, there are now two “beautiful” locations for people to visit. Whether it is Argentina’s Formosa with its green plains and lush* forests, or Taiwan with its bustling* cities and mountain landscapes, both places are sure to impress visitors. Perhaps the residents of these two lands on opposite sides of the world can get to know each other better as well! 
﻿　　Just as artists paint with different colors, poets create pictures in the reader’s mind with images made of words. These “images” help the reader to build up a mental picture of what poets want to say or describe, and to see or feel it on a deep level. The following is an example. In a Station of the Metro* The apparition* of these faces in the crowd; Petals on a wet, black bough*. －Ezra Pound* (-)－ 　　Pound said he wrote this poem to express exactly the experience of a particular moment. Upon getting off a train one day in a crowded Paris subway station, he was struck by the beauty of the faces he saw. He later described this “impression” in a poem thirty lines long. But then he realized that unless he could do it in just two lines, it wouldn’t be true to the experience. Each line contains a single image, and the two images combine into a striking metaphor: the faces seen by the poet as he walked past looked like petals emerging from a “wet, black bough.” At that moment, this was how they actually looked to him; the metaphor catches the real experience. 　　If this also looks like an oriental image, it is because Pound was very interested in classical Chinese and Japanese cultures. He said the above poem was like a Japanese haiku*, a very short poem that uses just two or three images to create a precise picture in the reader’s mind. When the individual images are fresh and clear and fit together naturally, their combination will be very powerful. This “picture” will be likely to help the reader see things in a new way. 　　The following are some examples of haikus. In them, you will read how these poets captured certain moments of their life experience with vivid images. Remember that images are not necessarily visual; poems can use imagery that refers to any of the five senses—sight, sound, smell, taste or touch. On the One-Ton* Temple Bell On the one-ton temple bell A moonmoth*, folded into sleep, Sits still. －Yosa Buson* (-), translated by X. J. Kennedy*－ In the Old Stone Pool In the old stone pool A frog jumps; Splishhhhhhhh. －Matsuo Basho* (-), translated by X. J. Kennedy－ The Piercing Chill I Feel The piercing chill I feel: My dead wife’s comb, in our bedroom, Under my heel. －Taniguchi Buson*, translated by Harold G. Henderson*－ 　　While reading these haikus, can you picture the immense stillness conveyed through the lively images? With their creative mind, poets, like painters, turn ordinary sights and sounds into images that create a poetic space where the reader may wander and wonder. Now we are going to read a few more poems written by Chinese Tang poets and by a contemporary American. Each creates a certain mood through the sophisticated* use of images. While reading them, you may try to take note of the key images and see what kind of atmosphere or state of mind is created through them. Deer Enclosure* In empty mountains not a soul in sight, Yet I hear echoes of people talking on site. Through thick woods comes dim twilight; Its reflection on green moss seems so bright. －Wang Wei* (-)－ Snow on the River Not a bird in a hundred hills. Not a soul on a thousand trails. Old man on boat in straw quilts*, Fishes alone in snowy chills. －Liu Zong-yuan* (-)－ Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; He will not see me stopping here To watch his woods fill up with snow. My little horse must think it queer To stop without a farmhouse near Between the woods and frozen lake The darkest evening of the year. He gives his harness bells a shake To ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound’s the sweep Of easy wind and downy* flake. The woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. ─Robert Frost* (-)─ 
﻿ 　　There are more than 37,000 known species1 of spiders in the world. They come in a wide variety2 of shapes and sizes. The largest spiders in the world live in the rain forests of South America and are known by the people who live there as the “bird-eating spiders.” These spiders can grow up to 28 centimeters1 in length—about the size of a dinner plate3, and, as their name suggests, have been known to eat small birds. In comparison4, the smallest species of spider in the world is native to Western5 Samoa2. These tiny6 spiders are less than half a millimeter3 long—about the size of  a period on this page7—and live in plants that grow on mountain rocks.  　　Some people like to keep spiders as pets, particularly8 tarantulas4, which are native to North America and can live for up to twenty-five years. 	Most people, on the other hand, don’t like touching spiders, and a large number of people are afraid of them, mostly because of their poison9. However, despite their bad reputation10, only thirty of the 37,000 known species of spiders are deadly11 to humans. Spiders actually provide benefits to humans by catching and eating harmful12 insects such as flies and mosquitoes. 　　The main thing that makes spiders different from other animals is that they spin13 webs to catch the small insects they feed on. The unique14 silk5 of   a spider’s web is produced by special organs found in the lower15 part of the spider’s body. It is light, elastic16, and strong—a spider web is five times as strong as steel17. Additionally, it is completely biodegradable6. This means that the web will completely decompose7 and in time return to nature—making   it perfect18 for uses such as making fishing nets19. Some people have tried    to raise spiders commercially to collect the silk these spiders produce,  but no one has ever really been able to. One reason why these businesses never stand a chance is that it takes 670,000 spiders to produce half a kilogram of silk, and all of these spiders need living insects for their food.  In addition, spiders are usually solitary20 animals, and need to be kept alone. 　　One company in Canada8 may have found a solution to making  artificial spider webs. In 2002, they said that they had used genetically9 modified21 goats to produce milk that contains the chemicals used to    make spider webs. Funded22 by the U.S. Army23 , the company hopes that   in the long run it will be able to make large quantities24 of very light, very strong materials25 for military26 and medical uses. Additionally, because   the manufacture27 of the artificial web is based on goats’ milk and    water, this type of industry28 would probably not cause any pollution29.  
 @@Steve Biko1, the third child in a black family, was born in South Africa. His father was a clerk and his mother was a maid. Biko did not have the opportunity to know his father because he died when Biko was only four years old. Steve Biko did extremely well in school as a youth1 but his political activities caused him to be kicked out of high school. Biko was nevertheless able to continue on to college because he received a scholarship2 to study  medicine in St. Francis College, a Catholic2 boarding school3. While in medical school, Biko became involved3 in the NUSAS4 (National Union4 of South African Students), a multiracial5, politically moderate5 organization.  @@It was while he was at St. Francis that Biko began questioning the apartheid system6 and the conditions that his people were forced to endure6. To  fight those conditions, he became more involved in the daily struggle7 that blacks7 faced, and he decided to quit8 medical school. @@In 1968, Steve Biko helped form the all-Black South African Students Organization and became its first president. The main aim of the organization was to raise black consciousness in South Africa through lectures9 and community activities. Biko felt that the apartheid system had a mental10 effect on the black population11. It had caused blacks to believe that they were inferior to whites, and it resulted in the lack of hope that black people felt. Biko encouraged blacks to break the chains12 of oppression13. @@Bikos political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African government, which resulted in him being banned14 in 1973. The banning restricted15 Biko from talking to more than one person at a time. Its aim was to try to stop the rising16 political movement17. However, it did not stop Bikos work. For the next four years, he continued to spread his message with his publication called Frank18 Talk. During this period Biko was often harassed19, arrested20, and held by the South African Police.  @@On August 18, 1977, Biko was seized by the police and held under Section 6 of the Terrorism Act8. Biko was held in prison21 for twenty-four days where he was questioned, starved22, and beaten23. It was not until Biko was lying unconscious24 that the doctors suggested that he be transported to the capital city for medical treatment, 740 miles away. On September 12, 1977, Biko became the forty-first person in South Africa to die while being held by the South African Police. @@The South African government stated that Steve Bikos death was caused by a hunger25 strike and that they were not guilty of any wrongdoing9. However, the official report showed that Bikos death was caused by brain injury26 from the application27 of force to the head. Bikos tragic death had a great effect on the people of South Africa and shocked the world. His funeral28 was attended by more than 15,000 people, not including the thousands that were turned away by the police. The memory of Steve Biko lives on through the struggle he helped to start and through the freedom that South Africans now possess29. 
 @@Theres nothing like being in love. Minutes seem to creep2 and fly by at the same time. We get lost on the way home, thinking of the next date. Music cries out to us alone, and the full moon winks3 at our way. Long after other memories fade4, the recollection1 of love lingers5. Its pure magic. Or at least thats what we like to tell ourselves. @@Despite all the advances6 scientists are making to explain the idea of love, we still want to believe that science will never tame7 romance. Were sure that love will always remain8 utterly separate from the cells and organs. And indeed, how could anything that so moves us to poetry and song be reducible9 to behavior10 and chemicals? @@Charles Darwin2 started answering questions like this when he published his book The Descent of Man3 in 1871. Darwin granted11 that his readers might doubt that humans evolved12 from an ancestral13 ape4. As man differs14 so greatly in his mental power from all other animals, there must be some error in this conclusion, he wrote. But he argued that the difference between us and other animals was of degree, not of kind. That applied not just to our teeth and toes but also to our morals and minds. And even, he declared15, to love. @@Man is a rational16 animal, Aristotle5 declared, but experiments have demonstrated17 that reason is not a gift of our species alone. In a study published in 2007, researchers reported that monkeys were almost as good as college students at arithmetic18. And our rationality is not a simple reasoning process but a complicated19 picture of strengths and weaknesses. We are good at solving reasoning problems if they are presented as social issues. We dont do as well if the same problems are expressed in logic20. A number of researchers argue that unlike other creatures, humans evolve to care and love, not to reason only. @@Martie Haselton6, a psychologist at UCLA, is exploring the forces that may have shaped the modern love. She believes it all comes down to the long-term  health of children. Haselton calls romantic21 love a commitment device22, a mechanism23 that encourages two humans to form a lasting bond24. Those bonds help ensure25 that children survive, getting fed and cared for by two parents rather than one. Natural selection has built love to make us feel romantic, she says. In her experiments, Haselton finds evidence for love as an adaptation26. People use love as a drive to form a long-term commitment. @@Haseltons conclusion does not degrade27 love. Instead, she tells us that humans choose romance as a way to adapt26 and to evolve. When we say that romance has an evolutionary history, we dont mean its identical28 to what other animals experience. Our ancestors13 branched off from other apes long time ago and have taken their own evolutionary journey since. Falling in love may be natural, but that doesnt mean its not exceptional29. 
Unit 4  For the Perfect First Date. @@Youve finally made it. Next Saturday, you will be going on a date with that special person whom youve had your eye on for quite some time, and this may be your chance to start a great romance. But what if the date doesnt go well? What if you blow this date? For most people, first dates can be very stressful. So, what can you do to increase your odds of success? The following are some useful tips. 1. Have the Right Attitude @@Youll find dating to be a pleasant and rewarding experience as long as you relax. If you are under pressure to make the date a success, youll probably be too tense to make a good impression. At the other extreme, pretending not to care at all can make things even worse. Think of dating as simply an opportunity to get to know more about other people and yourself. If things work out, great. If not, youll learn from the experience and do better next time. Smile, stay optimistic, and let yourself have fun.2. Choose the Right Place @@The usual dinner and movie is not always the best choice for a first date. You cant get to know more about someone while your eyes are glued to a cinema screen. In addition, if the movie happens to be awful, it might create a negative mood for the whole date. Make the date special by going to a museum or an art gallery. The peaceful atmosphere makes conversation easy, and you can chat about the artworks that catch your attention. Amusement parks can also be a good choice, too, for they make most people feel energetic and carefreeXwhich is perfect for starting a romance.@@3. Let Your Partner Do Most of the Talking @@During a date, of course, it is necessary that you keep the conversation lively. Although an awkward silence is never welcome, the worst thing to do is to just talk about yourself the whole time. If you make this mistake, you may come across as either arrogant or insecure. Try to focus the conversation on your partner and be a sympathetic listener.@@4. Talk About the Right Things @@A lot of people ask questions only about typical and predictable topics, such as school and family. These questions are not bad, but if you ask only this kind of question, youll find your date yawning every ten minutes. It is advisable that you ask some questions that demand a little thinking or lead to interesting answers. For example, try a question like this: If you had an extra hour of free time each day, how would you spend it? This kind of question helps people open up and overcome nervousness. If it doesnt work, then try to find a topic that both of you have an interest in and let the conversation flow from there. If you have difficulty finding any topics that you two have in common, then the chance that you two will ever have a steady relationship is probably quite slight. @@Finally, dont ask or talk about previous relationships. People who talk about their previous relationships usually havent gotten over them yet. If you complain about your ex, your date may think you are still not ready for a new relationship. @@In conclusion, respect your date and show your sincerity! If youre not in a relationship, dont worryXa new relationship will be coming along soon. Good luck with your first date! @@XAdapted from For the Perfect First Date.
