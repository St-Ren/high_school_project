Eat Better, Look Better.
Would you believe that your diet can make a big difference in helping you to keep a youthful appearance?
It seems strange to think that the food we take in could result in fewer wrinkles.
Wouldnt it be better to put things on our skin rather than in our mouths?
Well, according to one scientific theory, our bodies start aging because of oxidation.
This means that certain oxygen-containing molecules in our cells, called free radicals, have the capability to attach to and damage parts of our cells, including our DNA.
Our bodies can repair this damage, but as we get older, these repair mechanisms start to break down, resulting in the signs of aging.
Free radicals are actually produced by our bodies, but their numbers can also increase because of the food we eat.
Besides avoiding foods that could potentially produce more free radicals, eating foods that contain certain vitamins and micro-nutrients can also contribute to keeping us looking young.
These vitamins help produce molecules called antioxidants, which actually help reduce the production of free radicals.
Even better, foods containing antioxidants are not rare.
Common antioxidants, like vitamins A and E, can be found in many dark-colored vegetables.
For example, carrots, seaweed, spinach, and broccoli are all excellent sources of these helpful vitamins.
Also, you can eat orange-colored fruits like apricots and peaches.
Vitamins A and E are particularly good for helping your skin remain young-looking.
These nutrients strengthen your skin and make it soft.
More recently, green tea has also been tentatively added to the list of youth-promoting substances.
Although research about the effects of green tea on our bodies is at an early stage, many scientists believe that it is good for us.
They are still cautious, however, about predicting its capability to keep us looking youthful.
But from recent experiments, its antioxidant properties seem to be able to repair cell damage already sustained as well as to prevent damage in the future.
In fact, green tea works even better if you apply it directly to your skin as an ingredient in facial cream.
You are what you eat. The more we find out about how our bodies work, the more this old proverb seems to be true.
Think about that the next time you sit down at the table.
