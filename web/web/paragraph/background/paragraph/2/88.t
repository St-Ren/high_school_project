Researchers say that body language accounts for 80 percent of what people communicate.
When words and body language don't say the same thing, you should believe what you see over what you hear.
Of all the nonverbal signals that people send, facial expressions are the most common-and the most complex.
Researchers say that the human face can produce some 7,000 different expressions.
People use hundreds of these facial expressions every day, conveying shades of meaning with subtle differences in the curve of a lip or the angle of an eyebrow.
Researchers who have studied facial expressions have found that many of them reveal certain basic human emotions, one at a time or in various combinations.
When you are surprised, you open your eyes, nostrils, and
mouth wide.
When you are afraid, your eyes are wide open,
too, but your facial muscles are tense.
When you are sad, the corners of your
mouth turn down.
You show disgust
by scrunching up your mouth and
wrinkling your nose and brow-an
expression that may have begun
when early people tasted something terrible.
In anger, your eyes narrow , and you look as if you are about to snar 1l.
When you are happy, you smile-your mouth curves up, and the corners of your eyes wrinkle.
These basic expressions seem to be part of a universal nonverbal language.
People from all over the world, with very different cultural backgrounds, recognize them and generally interpret them in the same way.
In one study, for example, researchers photographed the facial expressions of a group of Americans and members of a New Guinea tribe, and then showed the photos of each group to the other.
The groups were able to interpret the expressions correctly 80 percent of the time.
Babies are born knowing how to form many facial expressions.
In the first few months of life, they learn how to use them.
For example, when a baby smiles, adults just can't help smiling back and gently touching and holding the baby, so babies learn that smiles bring good things.
That strengthens the happy feeling of a smile.
Researchers have found that babies who get lots of smiles also smile a lot.
But if no one smiles back, babies gradually smile less and less.
Some researchers think that certain facial expressions may actually help create the emotions.
You can try this out for yourself.
If you are feeling a bit low, put on a really big smile and hold it for a few minutes.
Do you start to feel happy?
One possible explanation for this is that the tightening of facial muscles affects the circulation of blood to the brain, and that in turn affects emotions.
Scientists are learning more about nonverbal communication all the time.
Knowing about body language is useful for everyone.
The more you study facial expressions, posture, and other nonverbal cues, the easier it is to make sense of them.
Then you will be better able to understand what people are really saying-even when they don't want you to know!
