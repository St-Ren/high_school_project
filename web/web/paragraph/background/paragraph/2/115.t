Unit 1  The Chain of Love.
He was driving his battered old car home on a country road one evening.
Since the closure of the Levis factory, hed been unemployed.
With winter raging on, the chill had finally hit home.
It was starting to get dark.
Although snow flurries drifted in the dim light of day, he could still notice an elderly lady stranded by the roadside.
Apparently, she needed some help.
So, he pulled up in front of her Mercedes-Benz and got out.
When he approached her, she was worried.
No one stopped to help for the last hour or so, she thought to herself.
Is he going to rob me Realizing that she was frightened, he said quickly, Im here to help, maam.
Why dont you wait in the car?
Its freezing outside.
By the way, my name is Joe.
All she had was a flat tire, but for an old lady, that was bad enough.
While Joe was changing the tire, the lady rolled down her window and began to talk to him.
She thanked him for coming to her aid.
Joe just smiled as he put the flat tire into the trunk.
She asked him how much she owed him.
Joe, however, never thought twice about helping others.
He certainly never thought about any kind of payment or reward.
To him, this wasnt a job, but rather a way to help someone in need, just like those who had given him a hand in the past.
He told the elderly lady that if she really wanted to repay him, she could help someone else that was in need.
He waited until she started her car and drove off.
It had been a cold and depressing day, but he felt content as he headed for home.
A few miles down the road, the lady saw a small, shabby caf?.
She went in to grab a bite and take the chill off before making the last leg of her trip home.
A waitress came over and brought the elderly lady a clean towel for her wet hair.
The waitress had a sweet smile, one that even being on her feet for an entire day couldnt erase.
The lady noticed that the waitress was heavily pregnant.
She wondered how a person like this waitress could be so thoughtful to a perfect stranger.
Then she remembered Joe.
Finally, the lady finished her meal.
When the waitress went to get the ladys change for the hundred-dollar bill, the lady slid out the door.
When the waitress came back, the lady was no longer in sight.
To the surprise of the waitress, the lady had paid almost fifty times as much as the price of the meal.
Then, the waitress saw something written on a napkin.
Tears blurred her vision as she read what the lady had written.
It said, Someone once helped me out in the way Im helping you.
If you want to pay me back, dont let the chain of love end with you.
That night, as the waitress lay awake in bed, she thought about the money and what the lady had written.
How would she know that we need money, especially with our baby due next month she wondered.
Her husband, who was worried sick about their future, was lying beside her.
She gave him a soft kiss and whispered, Everything will be all right.
I love you, Joe.
