Steven Spielberg
Most of us can remember the titles of our favorite films.
Few, however, can remember the directors of those filmsXwith a few exceptions.
One of them, Steven Spielberg, is a household name.
He has entertained the world with stories of a daring archeologist.
Hes made us cry with the tale of a space alien who just wanted to go home.
Hes scared us with sharks and dinosaurs.
And he brought us the horrors of World War II in Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan.
Spielberg developed an interest in movies at an early age.
At twelve, he started making his own short films with his dads movie camera.
He sometimes enlisted his mothers help.
She would make movie props for him.
Spielbergs three sisters also liked to be in his moviesXhe killed them all several times.
At age sixteen, Spielberg made his first feature-length film, Firelight.
His family rented a local movie theater to show it.
He spent five hundred U.S. dollars making the film, but it earned back its whole budget in one night.
Spielberg got poor grades in high school and wasnt accepted to any film schools.
But never had he felt discouraged.
Instead, he regularly bluffed his way onto the Universal Studios lot.
He used an empty office as his own while trying to talk producers into looking at his films.
His twenty-two-minute film called Amblin won awards at the Venice and Atlanta film festivals.
It also caught the attention of the head of Universals TV division.
He signed Spielberg to a seven-year contract.
At twenty, Spielberg was the youngest director ever to get such a deal.
In 1974, Spielberg made his feature film debut with The Sugarland Express.
Spielberg really impressed producer Richard Zanuck with his skill in managing movie scenes.
But audiences were less than thrilled with his efforts.
The film performed poorly at the box office.
1975 was a different story, however.
Spielberg was chosen to direct Jaws.
In an interview with a New York magazine, Spielberg said, Parts of the book terrorized me.
I tried to translate my fear into visual language. He succeeded.
People flocked to theaters to be scared out of their wits.
Spielberg continued his string of hits in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark.
The film earned Spielberg his first Oscar nomination for best director.
Films two and three in the series also thrilled audiences.
In 1985, Spielberg challenged himself to make a more serious film.
The Color Purple was the result.
The film earned eleven Academy Award nominations, but didnt win a single award.
Finally, in 1993, Spielbergs heartbreaking film Schindlers List earned him an Academy Award for best director.
In 2002 Spielberg received another honor that he treasured highlyXa college diploma.
He wanted to set an example for young people of the importance of a college education.
But he hopes his children wont take thirty-three years to finish their degrees!
Spielberg continues to make films.
Not all are box office hits, but each tells a story as only Spielberg can.
He has ranked as the most successful director in the American film industry.
Other directors may try to catch up with himXif they can.
