Starting a new high school life away from home is never easy, especially for the shy and awkward Bella Swan.
Although many students befriended her, it was not until she saw the Cullens that she found people who really interested her.
From their pale, white skin to their mysterious aloofness, everything about them was different.
Bella was immediately attracted to the youngest brother, Edward, and couldn't take her eyes off him.
She soon met him in biology class, and, after a difficult beginning, they slowly began to talk.
Their paths crossed again in the school parking lot.
Bella was just about to get into her truck when suddenly, a van passing by lost control and skidded right towards her at an alarming speed.
Startled, she froze and was unable to react.
But at the very last second, Edward miraculously appeared beside her and stopped the massive force from crushing them both with his bare hands.
She was utterly stunned and confused.
Although thankful, Bella was determined to find out how Edward seemingly defied the laws of physics.
It wasn't just his superhuman strength and speed; he also had icy cold skin, and neither ate nor went out into the sunlight.
She was so driven that she wasn't even aware that thoughts of him began to occupy her mind every minute of the day.
"What if I'm not the hero?
What if I'm the bad guy?"
he had once said to her.
But she would never believe that Edward was a bad guy.
When she thought of him, his voice, his hypnotic eyes, and his magnetic personality, she wanted nothing more than to be with him right then and there.
So when he finally confirmed her suspicions and revealed that he was a vampire, Bella wasn't afraid.
It didn't matter that a part of Edward thirsted for her blood.
She was completely in love with him and knew he felt the same way.
The two became inseparable.
Both being different from the crowd- outsiders in a sense-they knew that they shared something special, something extraordinary.
Everything was going well until Edward's family and Bella ran into another group of vampires.
These vampires were not like the Cullens.
They enjoyed killing humans.
And when one of them, James, realized how far Edward and his family would go to protect Bella, his desire to hunt her intensified.
He tricked her into leaving the Cullens and falling into his trap.
When Bella realized what had happened, she was sure that this would be the end of her.
In her futile struggles to escape, her hand was bitten by James' poisonous vampire fangs.
Just before he could deliver the fatal blow, however, Edward heroically came to her rescue and defeated the predator.
But to save her, he had to suck the venom out of the wound without draining the rest of her blood-a desire almost impossible to control.
Trembling and fighting back his instinct, he summoned all his will and determination and saved Bella without killing her.
By the time Bella returned home, she had fully recovered.
Later that semester, Bella went to the school prom with Edward.
She couldn't dance, so the prom was the last place she would go to.
But with him by her side, she felt assured.
She felt like she could do anything.
In fact, for the first time in her life, she felt like she really belonged.
The evening was perfect, and Bella was left with no doubt in her mind that Edward was the person she wanted to spend the rest of her life with.
However, she didn't want to grow old and be separated from him by death, so she asked him to change her into a vampire.
"You don't want this."
Edward refused, hoping that the girl he loved would be able to enjoy a normal human life.
"So that's what you dream about, becoming a monster?"
"I dream about being with you, forever."
Bella replied.
