It's a "Punderful" Life.
Language is fun.
Everyone who speaks and listens and reads and writes is involved with the natural playfulness of language.
In English, much of that play takes the form of punning, as in this verse, which has fun with the two meanings of the word weather and its similarity in sound to whether:
Whether the weather is good,
Or whether the weather is not;
Whether the weather is cold,
Or whether the weather is hot;
We'll weather the weather,
Whatever the weather,
Whether we like it or not!
As an English learner, you probably have chanted songs like this one:
A sailor went to C-C-C,
To see what he could C-C-C,
But all that he could C-C-C
Was the bottom of a great blue C-C-C.
Verses like this are children's first attempts to put into memorable forms their pleasure in discovering that the same sound can suggest two or three different meanings- like C, sea, and see.
Words and sounds that spark two or more meanings are called puns.
A pun has been defined as a play upon words, and a prey upon words.
You probably recognize many of these traditional riddles:
What's black and white and red (read) all over?
A newspaper.
What kind of rooms have no walls?
Mushrooms.
What happened to the boy who drank eight Cokes?
He burped Seven-Up.
Here's a game riddled with punch lines.
Guess the punch lines of these popular jokes.
You'll find the answers below:
Why did Silly Billy tiptoe past the medicine cabinet?
He didn't want to wake up the .sleeping pills.
Where do elephants store their clothes?

You can also find instances of punch lines on posters and placards on which people manipulate words for a humorous purpose.

On the wall of a dentist's office: Always be true to your teeth, or they will be false to you.
In a garden shop: Lighten up your garden.
Plant bulbs.
When you read the puns in the verses, riddles, and signs above, can you feel the natural playfulness of language?
Do you laugh at the punch lines?
If so, congratulations!
With a little imagination and a sense of humor, you can also make up your own puns.
Look for ideas in the verses you read, the riddles you hear, and the signs you see.
Why not start with a sign for a restaurant, a candy store, or even your school?
Once you do, you'll have more fun with English!
