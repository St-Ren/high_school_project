Unit 11  Theyre Back!
Each year, an estimated ten thousand to one hundred thousand species die off.
After that, they wont be found in the wild, nor will they be seen at any zoo.
They will join the countless other species that have gone extinct over the course of Earths historyXand extinction means forever, or at least it used to .
Scientists now think it highly possible to bring extinct species back from the grave.
This doesnt mean the plot of Jurassic Park is going to become a reality, though.
Researchers need DNA to bring a species back from extinction.
DNA is the chemical that contains the genetic code of organisms and carries the structure of a living thing.
Dinosaurs, which disappeared sixty-five million years ago, have been gone too long for any of their DNA to remain in fossils.
But theres a very good chance that more recent species can be made to walk in the world again.
Such animals could even include Ice Age animals like the woolly mammoth.
In 2009, scientists recreated the Pyrenean ibex, which had become extinct about a decade earlier.
The new animal didnt survive longXit died only seven minutes after its birth.
Yet, scientists are continuing to make every effort to improve this technology, and scientific advances should increase the success rate.
In 2013, Australian scientists announced that they were on their way to bringing the gastric brooding frog, a native of eastern Australia which perished in the mid?1980s, back to life.
Being able to bring species back doesnt mean that we should do it.
There may be many a benefit of reviving a species; however, we cannot accurately forecast what the results might be, nor can we deal with the possible disasters.
Take passenger pigeons, for example.
Living in flocks made up of billions of birds, they used to be one of the most common birds on the planet.
Flocks of migrating passenger pigeons darkened the sky, and it sounded like thunder when they flapped their wings.
This species vanished a century ago because of being hunted on a massive scale.
If we make it possible for passenger pigeons to exist again, there is no knowing whether they will still be able to live in their old habitats.
Will they crowd out any remaining species?
Will their great consumption of seeds affect the growth of trees?
Some people believe that humans are responsible for the extinction of certain animals, which obliges us to correct the situation.
As environmentalist Stewart Brand once said, Humans have made a huge hole in nature.
We have the ability now to repair some of that damage. However, others consider it inappropriate to bring species back, since this weakens the support for traditional conservation: Why do we have to preserve a wildlife habitat or fight poachers, if we know we can just reverse our mistakes?
As technology develops, extinction now may no longer be something that lasts forever.
But whether it is right to make extinct species return is still a matter for debate.
In order to avoid possible disasters of reviving extinct species, we would do well to remember the lesson of Jurassic Park: Proceed with cautionXand leave the velociraptors alone.
