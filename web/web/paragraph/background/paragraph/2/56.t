The Cost of Gratefulness.
When I was about thirteen, my father frequently took me on short outings on Saturdays.
On the way home from these trips, we often stopped for ten-cent ice cream cones.
I couldnt be sure my father would stop at the ice cream store, but from the time we started heading home, I would hope and pray that he would.
I knew we would either go straight for the ice cream store or turn and go home empty-handed.
He would ask, Would you like an ice cream cone and I would say, That sounds great, Dad! Id always have chocolate and hed have vanilla.
He would hand me twenty cents and I would run in to buy our cones.
Wed eat them in the car.
I loved my dad and I loved ice creamXso this was heaven.
One fateful day we were heading home, and I was hoping and praying for the beautiful sound of his offer.
Then it came, Would you like an ice cream cone today?
That sounds great, Dad!
But then he said, It sounds good to me too, Son.
How would you like to treat today?
Twenty cents!
My mind reeled.
I could afford it, but saving money was important.
Dad had often told me that.
And when it came to my own money, ice cream just didnt seem like a good thing to spend it on.
Why didnt it occur to me that this was a golden opportunity to give something back to my very generous father?
Why didnt I think that he had bought me at least fifty cream cones, and I had never bought him a single one?
But all I could think was the idea of spending twenty cents!
In a fit of selfish, miserly ingratitude, I said the awful words that have rung in my ears ever since: Well, in that case, I guess Ill pass.
My father just said, All right, Son.
But as we turned to head home, I realized how wrong I had been and begged him to turn back.
Ill pay! I pleaded.
But he just said, Thats OK. We dont really need ice cream, and he wouldnt listen to my pleading.
We drove home.
I felt awful about my selfishness and ungratefulness.
He didnt rub it in, though, or even act disappointed.
I learned that generosity goes two ways and gratitude sometimes costs a little more than just thank you. On that day gratefulness would have cost me twenty cents, and it would have been the best ice cream Id ever had.
Ill tell you one more thing.
We went on another trip the next week, and as we approached the crucial corner I said, Dad, would you like an ice cream cone today?
My treat.
