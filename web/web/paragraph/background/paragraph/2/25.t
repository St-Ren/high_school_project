Body Language.
Everyone uses body language.
Its one of the things we cant help doing.
In Japan, for example, you will often see people bowing as they talk on the phoneXeven though the other person cant see them doing so.
Similarly, its said of some Europeans that if you were to cut off their hands, they wouldnt be able to communicate at all; to them, hand gestures are an essential part of their communication.
Often people say one thing with their words, but their body language expresses something completely different.
This shows that they are either, at best, just trying to be polite or, at worst, lying.
Knowing how to read body language is a useful communication skill.
Its also important to know how to use body language to get your message across in a persuasive manner.
Different aspects of body language include proximity and a variety of hand gestures.
Some of these aspects are standard around the world, while others vary from culture to culture.
Have you ever heard of the diplomatic dance?
Its something that happens in international cities when people from different cultures come together at a party.
As one person tries to get closer to talk, the other person, if from another culture, might try to move away.
The result is a kind of dance as one person pursues and the other retreats around the room.
This dance has to do with proximity or how comfortable people feel standing next to each other.
The furthest business people feel comfortable standing away from each other is in one of the most crowded countries in the world: Japan.
However, in the Middle East its said that you should feel the breath of the other speaker on your face.
These are some distances at which people feel comfortable standing next to each other:
E Japan: 90 centimeters
E United Kingdom: 60 centimeters
E North America: 48 centimeters
E Europe: 35-40 centimeters
E Middle East: 20-30 centimeters
Hand Gestures
Hand gestures are among the most confusing aspects of body language because they vary greatly around the world.
Differences in hand gestures have become less daunting in recent years with the popularity of international movies that take common gestures from one culture and introduce them to another.
Someone who has seen a foreigners unusual gesture in a movie is less likely to be confused or offended by it when they see someone else doing it in person.
