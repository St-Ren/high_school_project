Unit 6  A Closer Look at Cultural Taboos.
With the convenience of modern travel, destinations that used to take a long time to get to can now be reached quickly.
Even distant countries may now seem closer.
Yet, wherever you decide to go, the cultures of the places you visit may be somewhat different from the culture of your home country.
Therefore, it is important that you adapt your behavior so that you dont offend the locals.
Here are some fundamental rules that will make communication easier, and your trip more enjoyable.
First, never raise your voice with a view to making yourself understood.
If you do not know the word for something in the local language, or cannot express whatever you think verbally, try drawing a picture or pointing to an object.
Remember, though, pointing directly at a person can be highly offensive in some cultures.
If you have to point at something, do so by holding the palm of your hand flat, facing upward, with your fingers outstretched and gesturing toward the object.
In addition, it is advisable to learn some basic words and phrases in the local language before you set out on your journey.
It is found useful for visitors to express gratitude and show politeness with the local words for please, thank you, and may I, as well as basic greetings.
Second, study the main religion of the country you plan to visit and learn about the taboos related to clothing, especially if you plan to look around sacred places.
As a precaution, always bring conservative clothes, such as shirts and long trousers, that cover your shoulders and legs.
Third, avoid sensitive topics of conversation.
If a topic is sensitive in your own culture, it is perhaps also a sensitive one in other cultures.
Feel free to show interest in the history and customs of the place you are visiting, but dont make comments rashly.
Otherwise, you may offend the local people.
Also, keep in mind that in many cultures, it is thought a taboo to display affection in public.
For instance, kissing in public places can be seen as unacceptable behavior.
If you are unsure of how to behave, watch the local people and copy themXif they dont do something in a certain way, you probably shouldnt either.
Last but not least, if you are staying with a host family and plan to give gifts, do some research in advance.
The idea of a perfect gift varies enormously from culture to culture.
In Chinese culture, for example, it is inappropriate to give fans or clocks.
The Chinese word for fan has a similar pronunciation to the pronunciation of separation, while the Chinese phrase for giving a clock sounds the same as the phrase meaning holding a funeral.
How to open gifts is also something treated very differently around the world.
If you are in a Western country, do not be surprised when you see the receivers immediately tear off the wrapping paper from a gift in great excitement.
They will then tell you how fantastic the gift isXwhether they genuinely like it or not!
However, the situation is quite the reverse in most Asian countries, where it is considered impolite to open gifts in front of the giver.
Whichever country you visit, you should always keep an open mind when it comes to the local customs.
Avoid being critical; try instead to show respect for the values of the country you are in, even if you do not actually agree with them.
