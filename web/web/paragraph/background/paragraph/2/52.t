The tradition of matchmaking has existed in many societies for thousands of years.
The older generation, especially parents, did not consider young people mature enough to find a suitable partner for life.
So parents often took it upon themselves to arrange matches for young people, and sometimes they hired professional matchmakers to do the job.
The parents and matchmakers would take several things into consideration, such as the educational level and the compatibility of the social and financial status of the two families.
They then made the choice themselves for fear that the young men and women, on their own, would choose a mate merely on the basis of physical attraction.
This matchmaking system also ensured that the social classes could be preserved.
In the 2th century, arranged marriages based on this age-old matchmaking system began to be despised while "love marriages" became the trend.
More and more young people insisted on the right to seek their own partners.
However, as modern life becomes more hectic and complex, many single people don't have the time and energy to find a mate for themselves.
They are once again seeking help in finding a compatible partner.
That's why professional matchmaking firms using computer technology are playing Cupid these days.
These professional matchmaking firms usually require that users fill out a long questionnaire online and take tests that determine personality traits and values.
They then sort through user information based on criteria like educational background, financial status, and physical features.
With the help of the Internet and other "scientific" methods, they would recommend potential matches for clients who don't have the time, the chance, or the courage for personal encounters.
In fact, online matchmaking is becoming a booming industry around the world.
A survey done in 2 by a leading website indicated that 5% of Internet users in Taiwan were single, meaning the country's market for online dating services has enormous potential.
One of the online matchmaking giants in America even claims that every day 1 U.S. couples who meet on its site are tying the knot, accounting for 2% of all U.S. marriages taking place on the same day.
Despite its popularity, high-tech online matchmaking also gives rise to various problems.
For example, some users may lie in their profiles.
Others may set their sights too high, hoping for the "perfect" match-which of course does not even exist.
Furthermore, online friendship doesn't necessarily translate into real-life compatibility.
That is to say, someone who seems to have everything you're looking for may actually be boring or annoying in real life.
On the other hand, someone whose profile you ignore or delete because he or she doesn't meet your standards might be just the special someone you are looking for.
Based on the information mentioned above, it seems that the bottom line is that any form of matchmaking simply creates an opportunity for eligible young people to get out and meet others.
Unless you really know what you need in a partner and a relationship, these "means" of matchmaking might not guarantee a lifelong relationship that satisfies both of you.
After all, it's risky to let a computer determine who your better half is, and what the rest of your life will be like.
