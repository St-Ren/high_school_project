The American Geo Prizm was made at the same factory as the Japanese Toyota Corolla from 1989 to 2002.
But, even though the former sold for US$2,000 less than the latter, twice as many Toyotas were sold.
Because European consumers trusted the Toyota brand more than Geo and they were happy to pay more for it.
Today's consumers often have difficulty deciding what to buy because many products are not different in quality or features.
Therefore, more and more people rely on brand names.
In fact, a brand name has become an asset.
The Coca-Cola brand name is valued at US$84 billion, which is 59 percent of the company's market value.
To make more money, executives must have a deep understanding of what brands are, how they help to make money for the company, and how they affect a company.
You may have noticed that brands are a part of your everyday lives.
For example, first thing in the morning, you can go for a run wearing Nike shoes.
Then, you might drive to the office in a new Lexus, and stop along the way for a cup of coffee at Starbucks.
However, these are not just shoes, cars, and coffee.
These are brands.
The names seem to promise a certain quality and style that you rely on.
In other words, a brand is a combination of the product's image, the promises it makes to consumers, and the values it stands for.
The promise of Nokia, for example, is consistent quality.
In addition, brands encourage consumers to choose products based on certain personality or lifestyle characteristics: Levi's stands for individualism while Nike represents a "just do it" way of thinking.
Companies with strong brands make huge benefits.
Some of these benefits are described as follows:
Brands drive consumer choice.
Consumers are more likely to do business with brands they know, respect, and trust.
Brands increase consumer loyalty.
Because consumers are more likely to choose brands they know and trust, it makes sense that consumers have the strongest loyalty to companies with good brands.
Brands assist new market entry.
Companies with strong brands are more likely to successfully enter new markets.
The Disney brand name is so strong that the Disney Cruise Line became one of the most successful new product launches on record.
Brands allow for higher prices.
Mercedes-Benz, for example, is so famous for its high quality that its SUV has been able to sell at a high price, despite the fact that Mercedes had never made SUVs before.
Brands attract employees.
According to a survey of MBA graduates, when choosing which job to accept, they ranked the company's brand name as the number one thing affecting their decision.
Brand name of the company was 25 percent higher than salary on the list of considerations.
Finally, if a company is concerned with making money, it must build its brand name.
A strong brand can carry a company into new markets, through change, and beyond the competition.
