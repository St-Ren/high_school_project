Kyoto, like a beauty in a kimono full of bright colors, delights tourists throughout the year.
In spring, pink cherry blossoms create a romantic atmosphere.
Emerald leaves rustle in the summer breeze, scattering sunshine on the narrow alleys.
Maple leaves in autumn blaze with the colors of orange and red.
When winter comes, white snow turns the whole city into a silver world.
Kyoto is the spiritual heart of Japan.
It was the nation's capital for more than 1, years, leaving behind a large number of historic shrines and temples.
One of the most photographed temples is the Golden Pavilion Temple.
This pavilion is covered in gold leaf and shines as brightly as the sun.
It casts a postcard reflection on the Japanese garden pond in front of it.
Those who seek Zen simplicity should visit Ryoanji Temple to see the most famous Zen rock garden in Japan.
Zen rock gardens use rocks and sand to suggest mountains and water.
They are designed to imitate nature within a limited space.
The skillful arrangement of the rocks and the sand is meant to imitate rippling water, and to provide the viewer with a tranquil sense of natural beauty.
A visit to a temple or shrine can never be complete without getting yourself an omamori at a gift shop.
An omamori is a good-luck charm in the form of a small cloth packet.
In it are prayers written on a piece of paper or wood.
It is believed to bring love, protection, good health, good luck, or success either in school or in business.
The Japanese also believe they should not open an omamori.
Once it is opened, the omamori will lose its magic power.
The Gion District is another popular tourist attraction.
The mysterious charm of the Gion District hides in the teahouses, where geishas in colorful kimonos have been performing their traditional arts for hundreds of years.
Geishas have to spend up to five years learning the traditional tea ceremony, musical instruments, songs, and literature.
They also have to learn how to perform the traditional kyomai dance.
Its dance movements are very controlled yet show very strong emotions.
If visitors to this district are lucky enough, they can catch sight of geishas on their way to or from work.
In Kyoto, the past and the present flow together like the graceful movements of kyomai.
Tourists like to come to Kyoto to view autumn's maple leaves or spring's cherry blossoms.
However, Kyoto's temples, geishas, and traditional arts can capture their hearts in any season of the year.
