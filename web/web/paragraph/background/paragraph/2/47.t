In the 1s, Marshall McLuhan, a well-known media scholar, wrote a book titled The Medium is the Massage.
What he meant was that under the influence of the media we unconsciously relax, and tend to believe every message we receive without giving it a second thought.
Now half a century has passed.
The mass media have further refined their ability to penetrate deep into our minds and sell us things.
Product placement, the displaying of brand-name items as "props" in TV shows, has become a very popular marketing technique, one most of us are probably not aware of.
When we see an actor eating a particular brand of cereal or using a certain laundry soap, we are likely to form a positive impression of the product unconsciously.
Although more subtle than traditional commercials, product placement makes the brand or product more visible to consumers.
If you take a close look, it is no exaggeration to say that most TV programs we watch today have brands "placed" in them.
One reason for the rapid growth of placement marketing is that it has become easy for viewers to avoid traditional commercials.
With devices like remote controls and DVR, viewers can skip the commercials by fast-forwarding or switching channels.
When ads become part of the show, however, viewers have no escape.
No wonder product companies are paying a lot of money to TV stations to place their products in scenes.
This has resulted in the rise of an ever-growing placement industry, which is estimated to earn $ billion a year in the U.S.
If you think that at least the news programs on major networks are objective, think again.
A coffee shop chain is reported to have paid a huge sum just to show the news anchor with a big cup of its coffee during the morning news.
This has raised new questions about the shifting line between news and sales.
People also wonder if there is a possibility that news networks might "filter" or "powder" the actual news in favor of the companies sponsoring the anchor seat.
In addition to TV, the big screen has also become a highly competitive display window for a wide variety of luxury products.
You must be familiar with movie scenes featuring charming actors and actresses dressed in fashionable costumes, driving fancy race cars, or drinking expensive whiskey-with the brand name prominently displayed.
You may also have been attracted by the beautiful scenes where the films take you-a five-star hotel, or an exotic island.
You may not know that filmmakers often have these luxury "props" and settings provided for free.
As a matter of fact, they get paid for incorporating them into their films.
Many famous producers even have the total cost of production paid off before the first movie ticket is sold.
As more and more people become aware of this practice, some are calling for more controls.
As one media scholar commented, "It is inherently deceptive if people don't realize that ads are ads."
There can be legal as well as ethical problems in this kind of marketing strategy.
Living in a world filled with messages from many media, we'd better remain alert to the secret force of the "massage."
