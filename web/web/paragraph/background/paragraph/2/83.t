 There are more than 37,000 known species of spiders in the world.
They come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.
The largest spiders in the world live in the rain forests of South America and are known by the people who live there as the "bird-eating spiders."
These spiders can grow up to 28 centimeters in length-about the size of a dinner plate, and, as their name suggests, have been known to eat small birds.
In comparison, the smallest species of spider in the world is native to Western Samoa.
These tiny spiders are less than half a millimeter long-about the size of  a period on this page-and live in plants that grow on mountain rocks.
Some people like to keep spiders as pets, particularly tarantulas, which are native to North America and can live for up to twenty-five years.
Most people, on the other hand, don't like touching spiders, and a large number of people are afraid of them, mostly because of their poison.
However, despite their bad reputation, only thirty of the 37,000 known species of spiders are deadly to humans.
Spiders actually provide benefits to humans by catching and eating harmful insects such as flies and mosquitoes.
The main thing that makes spiders different from other animals is that they spin webs to catch the small insects they feed on.
The unique silk of   a spider's web is produced by special organs found in the lower part of the spider's body.
It is light, elastic, and strong-a spider web is five times as strong as steel.
Additionally, it is completely biodegradable.
This means that the web will completely decompose and in time return to nature-making   it perfect for uses such as making fishing nets.
Some people have tried    to raise spiders commercially to collect the silk these spiders produce,
but no one has ever really been able to.
One reason why these businesses never stand a chance is that it takes 670,000 spiders to produce half a kilogram of silk, and all of these spiders need living insects for their food.
In addition, spiders are usually solitary animals, and need to be kept alone.
One company in Canada may have found a solution to making  artificial spider webs.
In 2002, they said that they had used genetically modified goats to produce milk that contains the chemicals used to    make spider webs.
Funded by the U.S. Army , the company hopes that   in the long run it will be able to make large quantities of very light, very strong materials for military and medical uses.
Additionally, because   the manufacture of the artificial web is based on goats' milk and    water, this type of industry would probably not cause any pollution.
