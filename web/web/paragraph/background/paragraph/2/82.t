Her Cherokee name was Nanye'hi.
The English settlers on the American frontier called her Nancy Ward.
But to her people, this Cherokee woman was best known as "Beloved Woman."
This was the title given to those women in high positions who made decisions for the tribe.
During the American Revolution, the warriors in her village had helped the British by attacking a colonial settlement in Georgia.
In her home, Nancy waited for the warriors to return from the battle.
Tired and weary, the Cherokee war party returned to the village.
As news spread of the dead and missing, cries of sadness rose among the people.
The warriors brought back with them a white woman named Lydia Bean.
"All the other people had gone away, but she stayed behind to save her cows when I captured her," one warrior boasted.
The crowd seized the woman, because she could give them what  they were seeking-revenge for their lost warriors.
From her home, Nancy Ward heard the angry shouts of her   people.
She opened a wooden chest and took out a white swan's wing,   a symbol of her high position.
Then she rushed out of her house.
Pushing her way through the excited crowd, Nancy saw Mrs. Bean tied to a wooden stake.
Sticks and logs were piled on the ground at her feet.
A torch was in a man's hand ready to set the woman on fire.
  "Stop!"
Nancy cried.
She spoke as the tribe's "Beloved Woman" now.
Moving the white swan's wing through the air in a wide, sweeping gesture, she demanded, "Cherokees, listen to me!
Haven't you had enough bloodshed?
Let your tears flow for those who have not returned, but hold your hand still."
The crowd was suddenly quiet.
The swan's wing paused in its flight and pointed to the man who held the flaming torch.
He nodded in agreement and dropped the torch.
Pointing the swan's wing at Mrs. Bean, Nancy requested, "Cut the ropes, and release that woman."
Nancy came forward and helped the  woman through the crowd.
Slowly the two women made their way up the dirt road, leaving the silent crowd behind them.
In a few days, Lydia Bean had recovered from the shock of her terrible experience and soon became friends with Nancy.
Weeks    passed as Nancy looked for a way to send Lydia home.
"Why did you stop to take care of your cows instead of running away?"
"I couldn't leave them," Lydia answered.
"Their milk-it's good  for the children."
"But there is mother's milk," Nancy said.
"Of course," answered Lydia, "milk for babies, but often there     is not enough.
And then there are the older children and adults."
"Our people have never raised them.
Since cows are slow-   moving, many of the Cherokees believe that people who eat their    meat will move as slowly as the cows."
"I don't mean to criticize Cherokee beliefs," she said, "but I'm sure they are mistaken."
"That could be," Nancy said, smiling.
"Cattle have been valuable since the beginning of civilization," Lydia continued.
"From cows there is meat, of course, as well as milk.
And from milk come butter and cheese."
After Lydia told Nancy about making butter and cheese, Nancy said, "We must have cows."
Then, with Lydia as a teacher, the Cherokees learned how to milk cows and make butter and cheese.
When it was time for Lydia to leave, she tried to express her thanks.
"I only did what was right," said Nancy, "but you have helped our whole tribe.
You have taught us the great benefits of cows."
"It is you who have done it, Nancy," said Lydia.
"You have brought great knowledge to your people that will benefit them forever."
