Imagine smelling flowers, but never seeing colorful blossoms.
Imagine hearing rain, but never seeing clouds.
Imagine a world in which danger, friends, and joy arrive without being able to see them.
Although this may sound like another world to you, it is the world to many.
It is how the world is seen by blind people.
Taiwans estimated 50,000 blind people face special challenges.
Crowded streets, uneven sidewalks, and signs that hang low make getting around difficult.
When shopping and traveling, they must trust the honesty of shopkeepers and taxi drivers.
For some, the challenges are so great that they rarely leave home without a sighted person guiding them.
At home, however, most blind people are able to live independently.
They manage their own apartments without anyone looking after them.
Of course, some things are a bit different.
Appliance switches are labeled with Braille so that the blind can read them by touch.
These labels allow the blind to use the appliances safely.
Household items are stored in specific places so that sightless people can easily find them.
Special labels on shirts and pants help the blind match the clothes they want to wear according to color.
There are many resources available for blind and visually-impaired people today.
Special schools and associations help them gain education and independence.
The Taipei Municipal Chiming School offers classes for sightless students aged 6 to 18.
They study the same subjects as any other student in Taiwan.
The Eden Welfare Foundation helps blind people with life skills.
The foundation provides job training and especially reaches out to those who have gone blind as adults.
Moreover, the Taipei Association for the Blind works to improve life for the blind.
The association works with the government on their behalf to secure their rights.
It helps blind people get insurance and tries to get laws passed to protect them.
The Huikuang Guide Dog Center, founded in 1992, trains guide dogs for the blind.
Its first guide dog, Aggie, a Labrador Retriever, helped raise the awareness in Taiwan of the difficulties blind people are confronted with.
One of the biggest challenges the sightless face is earning a living.
There are not enough social welfare programs in Taiwan to help them.
In the past, nearly all of Taiwans working blind gave massages.
Many of the blind still work in this traditional field, but today, with the help of technology and caring teachers at schools like Eden, new opportunities are widespread.
Blind people are learning computer skills, developing their musical talents, and studying sound engineering.
They train to work as
social workers and telephone operators.
Some develop special sensitivity in their other senses and become skilled wine and tea tasters.
Some sighted people are afraid of the blind.
When confronted with a blind person, they feel awkward.
They avoid blind people because they dont want to embarrass themselves.
But blind people are no different from anyone else.
They enjoy the same pastimes as others.
They like listening to music, learning foreign languages, playing games, making crafts and even going to movies.
But unlike most people in Taiwan, the blind must rely on the sound track instead of subtitles because they cannot see.
Although those with and without sight walk down the same streets, they live in two worlds, facing different challenges.
The challenge for those with sight is to understand the difficulties, problems and abilities of the blind, and to give what blind people want mostXfriendship.
On the other hand, the challenge for sightless people is to believe in themselves and to realize that they can do what those with sight do.
