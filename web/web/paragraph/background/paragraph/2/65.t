Love Matters.
As for the romantic love between a man and a woman, some people say such love is cruel, while others say it is sweet.
Still others consider love to be blind.
One thing is for sure: love is mysterious and paradoxical, and the definition of it may vary from person to person.
In fact, peoples feelings about love depend on whether they are in search of love, deeply in love, or suffering from the loss of love.
Thus it is not easy to define the abstract idea of love, especially romantic love.
Love is frequently chosen as a subject of poetry.
Maybe we can better understand what love is by reading some works on love.
In the following poem entitled Glove, a romantic couple is skillfully compared to a hand and a glove:
Bruce Guernsey (1944-)
If in this word
is love itself
then love is bone
and blood inside
the form that warms
your lovely handX
your hand is love
and mine that takes
your love in mine
without your hand
is nothing but
an empty word.
The metaphor here is that of a person holding his or her lovers hand like a glove holds a hand.
The glove or hand would be empty without the hand inside of it.
Thus we have the sense that ones life would be incomplete or even completely meaningless if he or she were no longer loved.
A White Rose shows us more about the essence of love itself:
A White Rose
John Boyle O'Reilly?
(1844V)
The red rose whispers of passion,
And the white rose breathes of love;
Oh, the red rose is a falcon,
And the white rose is a dove.
But I send you a cream-white rosebud
With a flush on its petal tips;
For the love that is purest and sweetest
Has a kiss of desire on the lips.
Roses often represent love in poetry, and in this poem the red rose of passion is compared to a falcon, an aggressive and even violent bird.
On the other hand, the white rose of love is compared to the dove, which symbolizes peace.
The poet OReilly finally sends to his lover a rose that combines both meanings, perhaps the most complete kind of love.
Though these two poets present different images of love through metaphorical language, readers can easily feel the truth in their descriptions of love.
After all, the basic elements of romantic love are obvious to all, no matter how different the definitions of love may be.
Love may be hard to define, but we have all experienced it in one way or another.
