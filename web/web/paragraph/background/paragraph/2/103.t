Unit 1  Putting Things Off.
Its late at night, and its time that I did my homework.
My eyelids droop as I see the English assignment before me: Write an introductory paragraph for an essay on one of the five selected topics.
I give some thought to the topics, but soon I find my eyes as well as my mind wandering to the mosquito bites on my leg.
Next, I notice a stain on the shirt I am wearing.
Then, I absently gaze at the clock.
Suddenly, I am pulled back to reality as I realize that in a few hours I will be sitting in English class, and I havent even started on my paragraph yet.
This is a classic situation for me.
I have managed to put off writing this paragraph all afternoon, just as I manage to put off nearly all of my assignments for hours, days, and even weeks.
Therefore, I am always in trouble when time runs out.
My English teacher once quoted Henry David Thoreaus words, The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. Thoreau was right.
Because of my procrastination, I have wasted a great amount of valuable time, and I find myself always one step behind in life.
The results of my procrastination can be summed up in the famous saying, Procrastination is the thief of time. I spend more time thinking up weak excuses for why I cant do an assignment now than I ever spend on the actual assignment.
I admit that there is room for improvement in the ways I have handled my assignments.
Sometimes, for example, I might call my friend for the eleventh time that day, or I might even watch a television show meant for a four-year-old.
Procrastination also causes me to waste time when I finally get down to the task I have been avoiding.
The simplest task takes up extreme proportions of my mind because of the panic I feel for having put it off for so long.
I become an irrational, dull thinker when I am rushed, and this makes me very slow in doing any task.
However, the clock ticks on; it never stops for procrastinators like me.
Furthermore, procrastination keeps me one step behind in life and at school as I try to catch up on what I should have already done.
While most students diligently do their homework for that day, I diligently do my homework from the night before, or even from a week earlier.
Because I can never seem to do a task when it is assigned, I never get the satisfaction from getting things done on time or being on top of everything.
Rather, I always end up feeling that I am at the bottom of a pit, trying to climb out?one late assignment at a time.
However, since I am always behind, catching up on my work is almost the same as trying to walk up a downward-moving escalator?very difficult and nearly impossible.
Because of my procrastination, I am never free to live in the present.
Instead, I always find myself trapped in unfinished business from the past.
Thus, procrastination continues to rob me of time.
My life is continually interrupted by spurts of anxiety and desperation as one deadline after another flies by.
I have yet to grasp the concepts of organization and promptness.
I hope that I will grasp them soon.
Otherwise, I will be doomed to a life in the procrastinators prison that I have built for myself.
