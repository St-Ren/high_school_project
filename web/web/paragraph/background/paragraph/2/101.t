When I was quite young, my family had one of the first telephones in our neighborhood.
I remember well the polished oak case on the wall at the bottom of the stairs.
The shiny receiver hung on the side of the box.
I even remember the numberX.
Hearing my mother talk to it was fascinating to me.
Then I discovered that somewhere inside that wonderful device lived an amazing personwher name was Information Please and there was nothing she did not know.
My mother could ask her for anybodys number; when our clock ran down, Information Please immediately supplied the correct time.
My first personal experience with this incredible being came one day while my mother was visiting a neighbor.
Amusing myself with some tools in the basement, I slammed one on my finger.
The pain was terrible, but there was no one home to offer sympathy.
I walked around the house with my sore finger in my mouth until I heard a sound.
The telephone!
Quickly I ran for something to stand on and dragged a chair to the landing.
up, I took the receiver and held it to my ear.
Information Please, I said to the mouthpiece just above my head.
A click or two, and a small, clear voice spoke into my ear.
Information.
I hurt my fingerw I screamed into the phone.
Nobodys home but me, I cried now that I had an audience.
Are you bleeding?
No, I replied.
I hit it with a hammer and it hurts.
Can you get some ice from the freezer she asked.
I said I could.
Then get a little piece of ice and hold it on your finger.
That will stop the hurt.
Youll be all right, she said.
After that, I called Information Please for everything.
I asked for help with my lessons and she told me where famous places werewincluding the romantic river I was going to explore when I grew up.
She even helped me with my math.
And there was the time that Petey, our pet bird, died.
I called Information Please and told her the sad story.
She listened and said the usual things adults would say to make a child feel better.
But I was feeling hopeless: Why was it that birds should sing so beautifully and bring joy to the whole family, only to end up as a pile of feathers feet up?
She must have sensed my deep concern, for she said quietly, Paul, always remember that there are other worlds to sing in.
Somehow I felt better.
Another day, Information, said the now familiar voice.
How do you spell fix I asked.
Fix something?
At that instant my sister, who took unholy joy in scaring me, jumped off the stairs at me.
I fell off the chair, pulling the receiver out of the box by its roots.
We were both shockedXInformation Please was no longer there, and I was not at all sure that I had not hurt her when I pulled the receiver out.
Minutes later there was a man on the porch.
Im a telephone man.
I was working down the street and the operator said there might be some trouble at this number.
What happened?
I told him, and he said, Well, we can fix that in a minute or two. He opened the telephone box, exposing wires and coils, and worked for a while on the end of the receiver cord.
He moved the hook up and down a few times, then spoke into the phone.
Hi, this is Pete.
Everythings under control at 105.
The kids sister scared him and he pulled the cord out of the box.
All this took place in a small town in the northwest.
Then, when I was nine years old, we moved across the countryXand I missed my guide acutely.
Information Please belonged in that old wooden box back home, and I somehow never thought of trying the tall, thin new phone that sat on a small table in the hall of our new house.
I often missed the conversations and recalled the sense of security I had when I knew that I could call Information Please and get the right answer.
A few years later, on my way west to college, my plane stopped in Seattle not far from where I lived when I was little.
I had about half an hour between connections, and I spent about 15 minutes on the phone with my sister who lived there now.
Then, really without thinking what I was doing, I called the operator in my hometown and said, Information Please.
Amazingly, I heard again the small, clear voice I knew so well: Information.
I had not planned this, but I heard myself asking, Could you tell me, please, how to spell the word fix?
There was a long pause.
Then came the softly spoken answer.
I guess, said Information Please, that your finger must have healed by now.
I laughed.
So its really still you.
I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during all that time....
I wonder, she replied, if you know how much you meant to me.
I never had any children, and I used to look forward to your calls.
I told her how often I had thought of her over the years, and I asked if I could call her again.
Please do.
Just ask for Sally.
Just three months later I was back at the Seattle airport.
A different voice answered, Information, and I asked for Sally.
Are you a friend?
Yes, I said.
An old friend.
Paul Villard.
Then Im sorry to have to tell you.
Sally had only been working
part-time in the last few years because she was ill. She died five weeks ago. But before I could hang up, she said, Wait a minute.
Did you say your name was Villard?
Well, Sally left a message for you.
She wrote it down.
What was it I asked, almost knowing in advance what it would be.
Here it is, Ill read itX Tell him I still say there are other worlds to sing in.
Hell know what I mean.
I thanked her and hung up.
I did know what Sally meant.
