   Ali and his younger sister, Zahra, lived with their parents in a poor neighborhood.
Their mother was very sick and their father was struggling to find a job, and they had only a little money with which to buy food.
As they had not paid the rent for several months, the landlord was breathing down their neck.
One day, Ali took Zahra's shoes to a shoe repairman to be fixed, but he lost them on the way home.
It wasn't until he got home that he realized he had lost the shoes.
He was afraid that his parents would be angry and disappointed, so he begged his sister to keep it a secret.
Zahra agreed and the two decided to share Ali's old running shoes.
Zahra's school hours were in the morning, so she would wear them first.
After school, she would rush back and give them to Ali.
He could then run to his school, which began in the afternoon.
Although he ran as fast as he could, Ali often arrived late and was warned by the school.
A few weeks later, Zahra noticed one of her classmates was wearing her shoes that Ali had lost.
When she and Ali followed the young girl home, they discovered that her family was even poorer than theirs.
Ali and Zahra were so filled with pity and compassion that they couldn't ask the girl to return the shoes.
Ali heard about a long-distance race that was held for the boys in the city.
When he learned that the third prize was a new pair of shoes, he decided to take part.
He ran home excitedly and promised his sister that he would win her the new shoes.
The day of the race arrived.
Ali had a strong start, but halfway through the race he began to get tired and his legs began to ache.
Getting more and more exhausted, he thought only of Zahra and his promise to her.
Dreaming of the new shoes he would win for his sister gave him strength, and he stayed right behind the two fastest runners, determined to finish third.
Suddenly, as the finish line drew near, another runner collided with Ali from behind and he crashed to the ground.
Ali looked up and saw the other boys rushing ahead.
Refusing to give up at this point, he jumped to his feet and ran as fast as he could.
He dashed across the finish line and won the race!
The spectators cheered wildly and took pictures of Ali during the award ceremony, but Ali was sobbing.
If he had come in third, he could have won the prize he wanted.
And now he couldn't go home with the new shoes.
He had let his sister down.
Filled with sorrow, Ali walked home slowly and found his sister eagerly waiting outside.
He didn't say a word, but Zahra knew immediately from his face that Ali didn't bring home what she was expecting.
She ran inside, leaving Ali alone at the door.
Neither of the kids knew that their father was riding home from work, with two new pairs of shoes on the back of his bicycle.
