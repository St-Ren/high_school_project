The Oscars.
Since 1927, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has given annual awards to people for their achievements in the movie industry.
At the awards ceremony, called the Academy Awards or the Oscars, winners receive an Oscarwa small statue of a man holding a sword.
The man is standing on a reel of film with five spokes on it.
Each point represents a branch of the Academy: actors, writers, directors, producers, and technicians.
Any of these people can receive an Oscar.
No one really knows how the name Oscar originated.
The most popular story is that an employee named Margaret Herrick saw the statue and said, Why, he looks just like my uncle Oscar. The name stuck, and it became official in 1939.
The Oscars ceremony has taken place in Hollywood every year since 1929, without exception.
For many years, the ceremony was held in different hotels and theaters in Los Angeles.
Finally, in 2001, the Kodak Theater was built in Hollywood as the permanent home for the ceremony.
In 1929, the ceremony was only about fifteen minutes long, but today it takes several hours.
In 2002, it lasted four hours and twenty-five minutes!
Thousands of people have received Oscars for their work in the movie industry.
The person who has won the most Oscars is Walt Disney, with twenty-six.
Three actors have received Oscars for playing roles with no words at all.
Some people have refused Oscars, some have been awarded Oscars after they have died, and one received an Oscar for a movie twenty years after the movie first appeared.
The Oscars ceremony was shown for the first time on television in 1953.
Ever since then, the audience has been growing.
Today, more than a billion people around the world watch the Academy Awards every year.
