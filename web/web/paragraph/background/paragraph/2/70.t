A Wealth of Health.
Look around, everyone is doing it.
Eating vegetables may not be the most popular way to pass the time, but it certainly will give you something in return.
No matter who you are, vegetables offer a wealth of health to all who indulge.
Eating asparagus was long believed to promote love and compassion.
Nowadays, this vegetable for lovers actually has science backing it up!
It is known for being a good source of folic acid, an important nutrient.
Women who plan to have children should eat a great deal of asparagus, as the nutrients in it help prevent birth defects and heart disease.
Generally speaking, asparagus is one of the most nutritionally balanced vegetables in existence, so you should not do without it.
Bok choy is a popular type of cabbage in the Far East.
In Korea, it is the main vegetable used to make kimchi.
Scientists have found that eating it lowers the risk of developing lung cancer.
Like asparagus, it contains folic acid.
Moreover it provides another nutrient, called lutein, which protects the eyes, slows cancer growth, and reduces the risk of heart disease.
There is also evidence that bok choy can strengthen our bones because it contains calcium and vitamin K. No matter how you cook it, bok choy has a delicate flavor that will complement all kinds of dishes.
Mushrooms are great flavor enhancers for food, and there are over 38,000 kinds of them.
Don't be fooled by their cute umbrella shape, though.
Mushrooms actually kill certain bacteria and viruses in our bodies.
Some mushrooms also contain plant chemicals that stimulate the immune system.
The benefits of eating mushrooms include lowering blood pressure and helping the body fight cancer.
Eating mushrooms is great for your health!
No wonder mushroom hunters around the world go into forests just to find this funny-looking, great-tasting fungus.
Chili Peppers
Many people, such as those who live in Thailand and Mexico, cook regularly with a number of chili peppers.
Chili peppers can really heat things up-- and not just in your mouth.
These peppers contain an active ingredient called capsaicin, which can make the blood move.
It contributes to blood circulation, which accelerates the delivery of nutrients throughout our bodies.
Improved blood flow also prevents blood clots that can lead to heart attacks or strokes, and it even helps reduce headaches.
So, feel free to spice things up-- it's good for you!
When told to eat their vegetables, children often ask the age-old question "Do I have to?"
If you want to live a long, healthy life, it is a good idea to say "Yes!"
