Lesson Three  The All-important Pumpkin.
For Americans, the simple pumpkin has come to symbolize everything that is important and meaningful about autumn.
Everyone knows its autumn when pumpkins begin to appear at roadside stands.
Soon afterward, pumpkins will decorate doorsteps at Halloween.
Then theyll be part of Thanksgiving holiday decorations.
Theyll also be baked into breads and pies.
Farmers will know winter is near when morning frost is on the pumpkin.
Pumpkin and squash are believed to be the first food plants cultivated by the Native Americans.
They cooked pumpkins in stews and fed uncooked pieces to their horses.
They planted pumpkins among their corn.
They also taught the settlers how to plant and eat them.
Very quickly the pumpkin became a favorite and an important garden vegetable.
It was a healthy addition to the settlers diet because it was rich in vitamins and minerals.
Of all the uses of pumpkins, none is as amusing as the way it was used by the eighteenth-century New Englanders, or Yankees. Yankee men used the pumpkin shell as a guide for cutting their hair!
They put the pumpkin on their head and trimmed around its base.
This gave rise to the expression pumpkinhead, which at first meant New Englander, and later meant someone who looked silly or stupid.
Every autumn there are pumpkin festivals held all over the United States.
They are a type of harvest celebration.
Pumpkin queens and kings are named.
Prizes are given for the biggest or the best-decorated pumpkin, or the best-tasting pumpkin pie.
With the help of fertilizers, some pumpkins have been grown to the size of a small car.
Pumpkins are popular with children, not so much for eating as for making jack-o-lanterns at Halloween.
This custom originated over 2,000 years ago with the Celts, who lived in what is now France and the British Isles.
They celebrated a harvest festival on October 31.
It was a joyous occasion, but in some ways also a sad one.
It marked the beginning of the long, dark, cold winter.
The Celts believed that in the darkness, the spirits of the dead walked upon the earth.
Therefore.
great fires were built on the hills to protect the people from bad spirits.
People hollowed out turnips, and put candles inside them.
They carried them if they went outside to protect themselves from evil spirits.
When the settlers came to America, they brought this custom with them.
They didnt have turnips, so they used pumpkins instead.
Today, of course, children look forward to Halloween and the carving of pumpkins.
First, the pumpkin is cut open at the top and hollowed out by taking the seeds and pulp out.
Then, funny or scary faces are carved into the side.
In the evening, a candle is put inside and the face glows in the dark.
Sometimes pumpkins are painted and decorated.
As Halloween approaches, jack-o-lanterns pop up on doorsteps everywhere.
After Halloween, Americans look forward to the Thanksgiving holiday.
Pumpkins and corn are often used as decorations during this time.
They symbolize autumn and the spirit of the season.
It is a time of giving thanks for the harvest, for the family, and for all the good things that families enjoy.
But pumpkins dont only serve as symbols.
Theyre eaten too.
Pumpkins are boiled, broiled, and baked.
Theyre put in bread, cakes, pies, ice cream, cookies, soups, and even hamburgers!
Sometimes there seems to be no end to the uses of pumpkins.
Who would ever have thought this simple plant would get to be so popular?
