Elizabeth Henderson bought a new cellphone that nearly drove her crazy.
"Over an eight-month period, I returned the phone to the store about 10 times, wrote letters, and called the manufacturer, but the phone continued to strike," said Henderson.
At last, she filed a complaint, and after three months, the manufacturer agreed to refund the amount she paid for it, pay her legal fees, and allow her to keep the phone.
Fortunately, Henderson's problems were resolved to her satisfaction.
However, most unsatisfied consumers do not file or delay filing complaints.
They just wish the manufacturer actively came to deal with their problems.
Research shows that consumers feel that complaining is too time-consuming, believe that nothing will come of it, do not know how or where to complain, or think what they will get back is too little or the problem too unimportant.
But no matter how small your concern is, the experts say that you should do something.
Expressing that you are dissatisfied does not have to take a lot of time.
Although writing a letter is one method of expressing your concerns, there are other things to try.
Here are a few creative ways to tell a company you are not happy:
Some websites allow you to read complaints filed by other consumers, look at consumer warnings, and get consumer reports.
One of the easiest ways to send a complaint is to surf over to www.planetfeedback.com.
This site helps you write a letter, delivers it to the right person, forwards copies to others, tracks the follow-up process, and records your results.
Your letter alone may not be read, but many letters or e-mails expressing similar complaints may get noticed.
Get everyone to write a letter.
Furthermore, these letters should not be form letters and should be sent as a group.
If you are not getting results from the customer service department, don't be afraid to ask for the CEO or chairman of the board.
The president may not respond personally, but chances are that someone will respond-especially if you team up with other unhappy customers.
This can be expensive, but consumers can buy advertising on television or in newspapers to let more people know about the problem.
Also, contact the local media to find out if they have a "consumer watchdog" program that reports customer complaints.
To begin with, try the Consumer Protection Commission (www.cpc.
It provides consumer tips and resources for complaint resolution.
Also, visit the Consumer's Foundation (www.consumers.org.tw), which offers consumers valuable information and resources to help unhappy customers.
Consumers can expect these organizations to investigate and help with the resolution process.
Of course the best way to have a good experience after buying something is to practice smart shopping habits from the start.
Find out whether anyone has filed complaints before and make sure you read the fine print before signing any deal.
