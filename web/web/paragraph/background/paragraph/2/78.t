There once was a king of Syracuse named Hiero.
The country over which he reigned was quite small, but for that very reason he wanted to wear the biggest crown in the world.
So he called in a famous goldsmith, who was skillful with all kinds of fine work, and gave him ten pounds of pure gold.
"Fashion this into a crown that shall make every other king covet it," Hiero instructed.
"Be sure that you put into it every grain of the gold I give you, and do not mix any other metal with it."
The goldsmith promised that within ninety days he would return to the king the crown he wished.
Ninety days later, true to his word, the goldsmith brought the crown.
All who saw it agreed that such a beautiful crown had no equal in the world.
When King Hiero put it on his head it felt very uncomfortable, but he did not mind that-- he was sure that no other king had so fine a headpiece.
Admiring it from all sides, King Hiero then weighed it on his own scales, and it weighed exactly ten pounds.
There was in the king's court a very wise man named Archimedes.
When called in to admire the king's crown, he turned it over many times and examined it very closely.
He wondered why the gold was a brilliant yellow, instead of the same rich red color that it had been in the lump.
"What if the goldsmith has kept out a pound or two of the gold and made up the weight by adding brass or silver?"
asked Archimedes.
"Oh, he would not do that," said Hiero.
"The gold has merely changed its color in the working."
But the more he thought of the matter, the less pleased he was with the crown.
"Is there any way to find out whether that goldsmith cheated me or honestly gave me back my gold?"
"I know of no way," was the answer.
But Archimedes was not a man to say that anything was impossible.
He took great delight in solving hard problems, and when any question puzzled him, he would persevere until he found some sort of answer to it.
So, day after day, he thought about the gold, trying to figure out how to have it tested without damaging the crown.
One morning he was pondering this question while getting ready for a bath.
The tub was full to the very edge, and as he stepped in, a quantity of water flowed out upon the stone floor.
"How much water did I displace by getting into the tub?"
he asked himself.
"Anybody can see that I displaced a bulk of water equal to the bulk of my body.
"Now suppose I put Hiero's crown into water; it will displace a bulk of water equal to its own bulk.
Gold is much heavier than silver.
Ten pounds of pure gold will not make so great a bulk as, say, seven pounds of gold mixed with three pounds of silver.
If Hiero's crown is pure gold, it will displace the same amount of water as any other ten-pound weight of pure gold.
But if it is part gold and part silver, it will displace a larger bulk.
Forgetting everything else, Archimedes leaped from the bath.
He ran naked through the streets to the king's palace shouting "Eureka!"
which in English means, "I have found it!"
The crown was tested and found to displace much more water than ten pounds of pure gold.
The guilt of the goldsmith was proved beyond a doubt.
