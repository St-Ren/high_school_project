Lesson Eight   Giant Pandas: an Endangered Species.
Many animals today are facing extinction.
Tigers, whales, dolphins, elephants, marine turtles, and great apes are all in serious danger of extinction.
Another very special animal that needs our protection is the giant panda.
Pandas are clearly an endangered species.
There are only about 1,500 of them living in the wild today.
All of them are found in China.
The biggest problem that pandas face today is the loss of their natural habitat.
This loss is due mainly to deforestation.
Because of the rapid growth of population in the past century, large areas of natural forest have been cleared for agriculture, timber, and human habitation.
As settlers push higher up the mountain slopes, panda habitat inevitably disappears.
Deforestation also threatens the pandas food supply.
Pandas feed mainly on bamboo, consuming up to 38 kilograms a day.
Without enough forest area, the pandas will starve.
To make matters worse, every 60 years or so the bamboo in a certain area may naturally bloom and die off.
It will take several years for the new bamboo shoots to grow back.
During this time, many wild pandas have to search for other areas to live in.
However, deforestation now leaves them with nowhere else to go.
Deforestation causes another serious problem.
When people cut down trees, the forest is broken into small areas.
In these areas, the pandas can only live in small groups.
Within these small groups, it is difficult for them to find appropriate mates.
As a result, they are facing a greater risk of inbreeding.
The younger pandas may get sick more often and become less adaptable to changes in the environment.
Another problem that pandas face is that young cubs are vulnerable and require a great deal of care.
Although the panda mother may be large and heavy, her cub is very small, weighing only about 100 grams at birth.
It has no fur and is blind for the first six weeks.
During this time the mother does not leave the cubs side.
She has to spend much time licking the cub so that it will not have any smell that might attract predators.
Fortunately, measures are being taken to help the pandas.
China and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have been working together to develop reserves in the mountains of China and to start breeding programs in zoos around the world.
Zoos are having some success in breeding pandas.
For example, a panda named Hua Mei, born in 1999 at the San Diego Zoo, is now living in China and is the mother of twins.
It is helpful, of course, to breed pandas in zoos, but without their natural habitat, the pandas of the wild are sure to become extinct.
The best thing we can do to help pandas is to preserve their habitat and take action to protect their lives.
