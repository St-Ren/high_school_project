Few of us ponder how we got our names because we are so used to our naming traditions.
If we look at the naming traditions of various cultures, we may learn something different from the things that we usually take for granted.
There are some distinct differences between Chinese and Western cultures regarding naming customs.
In the former, people tend to keep their family name from generation to generation.
This is why there are tens of millions of people sharing common family names such as "Wang" or "Li."
In many Western countries, on the other hand, surnames often change and there tends to be a wider range of them.
Furthermore, Chinese people show respect for their elders and ancestors by not passing on their given names.
In Western societies, however, naming a child after an ancestor is an indication of esteem and affection.
While in most cultures only the surname of the father is carried, in Spanish -speaking countries, people take the family names of both their mother and father.
For example, the celebrated Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal Parera received "Nadal" from his father and "Parera" from his mother.
Unlike the usual English names we know, the middle name is regarded as the surname in Spain and is passed on from generation to generation.
In cultures where family links are indicated in names, some unique rules exist.
In Iceland, a person's last name usually comes directly from the first name of the father.
For instance, a boy named Erik born to a father named Lars would be named Erik Larsson.
Lars's daughter, Kristin, would go by the name of Kristin Larsdottir.
Therefore, the vast majority of Icelandic names end in either "son" or "dottir."
You can imagine that when Erik has his own sons and daughters, their last names will be Eriksson and Eriksdottir respectively.
For the Yami people of Taiwan, the naming tradition works the other way around.
In this culture, the son does not take the name of the father.
Instead, the father changes his name upon the birth of his first son.
For instance, a father who names his son Lamboan would also change his own name to Shaman Lamboan, meaning "Father of Lamboan."
Additionally, the boy's grandfather's name would be changed to Shabin Lamboan, which stands for "Grandfather of Lamboan."
Not all cultures suggest family relationships in their naming system.
For example, in the Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar, the convention is for people to go without a surname.
Our names are determined by the customs and traditions of our culture.
They also decide how we think of ourselves and our relationship to the culture.
"What's in a name?"
Shakespeare inquired in one of his renowned plays.
Apparently, quite a lot.
