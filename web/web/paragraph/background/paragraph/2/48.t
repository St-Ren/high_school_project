You might have heard of the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building, but have you heard of "The Guggenheim"?
It is not only one of New York City's best-known museums but also one of its most important architectural landmarks.
It's the first Guggenheim Museum, but not the only one.
You can visit five varied Guggenheim Museums around the world.
New York's Guggenheim, which opened on October 2, 1, is permanent home to a famous collection of modern and contemporary art and features special exhibitions throughout the year.
It was planned by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and designed by an American architect Frank Lloyd Wright.
Wright loved nature as a child, and as an architect he felt that there must be natural forms for buildings so as to be in harmony with their surroundings.
He could finally put his ideas into practice when the Solomon Guggenheim Foundation invited him to design the museum in New York.
Never had the architect been so excited by a new challenge.
He chose a site near Central Park so that one side of the museum would overlook water and trees.
Wright wanted to create an "organic" structure that would open out into the world rather than isolate people from it.
He was eager to experiment with a design that had fascinated him: the spiral shape of seashells that wind around themselves.
New York's Guggenheim is a cylindrical building whose circular wall widens as it rises.
Within the museum, all the paintings are displayed along the walls of the spiral.
The building does not need any stairs.
Instead, a widening spiral ramp starts at ground level and circles upward around the wall five times until it reaches the top, where a huge skylight lights up the vast central space below.
Thus, most visitors first take an elevator to the top and then slowly walk down the ramp, gazing at the paintings as they go.
And because the walls lean outward, each painting is viewed from the slightly tilted angle at which Wright believed the artist himself or herself had looked at it while painting it.
Very pleased with Wright's New York museum, the Guggenheim Foundation went on to establish three more museums in Europe.
Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain is the best-known.
Since Bilbao is a port city, Gehry made the museum look something like a ship, and the shiny metal pieces on the walls seem to have been designed to resemble fish scales.
The second European Guggenheim is the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, beautifully situated on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy.
This museum, originally Peggy Guggenheim's home, is devoted to modern and contemporary paintings.
The third, Berlin's Deutsche Guggenheim, may look somewhat ordinary from the outside, but it is actually considered one of the most exciting and experimental art museums in Germany.
It is a joint venture between the Guggenheim Foundation and Deustche Bank, the owner of the largest single art collection in the world.
The newest one, the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, is estimated to be opened in 2.
Also designed by world-famous architect Frank Gehry, it will be the world's largest Guggenheim.
The building will be a fine example of modern, international architecture with Middle-Eastern features.
Each of these five museums houses many valuable artworks and has a unique architectural design that displays the architect's creativity.
It was the Guggenheim Museum in New York that was the first to break the mold.
With its unconventional structure and whole new way of viewing paintings, this architectural masterpiece will surely continue to challenge and inspire us.
