Despite the cold January weather in Taipei, things are getting hot in the underground mall between two MRT stations.
Bodies and limbs are whirling about in a frenzy of windmills, headspins and handglides.
It may sound like a street fight, but there's nothing violent about the thing that is happening here.
The combatants are actually taking part in a street dance competition.
Street dance has its roots in American hip hop culture, which emphasizes the expression of the self and the courage to try new things.
It began as a way for African Americans to express themselves and their frustrations through dance.
The trend found its way to Taiwan in the mid-s and has been growing in popularity ever since.
From Taipei to Hualien, more and more young people in Taiwan have discovered the liberation and the freedom of expression through street dance.
It is a welcome escape from the relative rigidity of other dance forms, such as ballet or ballroom dancing.
There are no set rules in street dance.
Instead, it's about testing the body's limits.
When doing the windmill, a male dancer rotates on his upper body with his legs spinning around in the air.
The headspin is one of the most visually stunning moves, where the dancer spins on his head.
From a headspin or a windmill, dancers can change into a handglide, in which they support their entire body weight with just one hand while spinning.
This move gets high marks for its degree of difficulty.
In addition to taking the human body to its absolute physical limits, street dance moves also test the limits of one's creativity.
That's why more and more battle-style competitions are popping up.
There are more than 3 such contests in the hottest time of the year for street dance.
In these competitions, two combatants from any two dance groups, also known as crews, stand face to face.
One will pull off a move and the other has to follow; if the latter succeeds, he will perform his own move for the former to follow.
The first one that is unable to match his opponent's move loses.
To win their battles, crews will practice for weeks in preparation for a competition.
Street dance has little prestige enjoyed by other forms of dance; however, street dancers take pride in the things that they're doing.
For many of them, this dance style represents something more than just movement.
As a famous dancer with 1 years of experience puts it, "Dance is my only way of reaching out and communicating with the world."
The young dance crews that have followed in this veteran's footsteps agree.
It is they who will take this underdog of the dance world to new heights.
