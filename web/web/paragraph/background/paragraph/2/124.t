Be yourself!
Many people know the importance of being true to themselves, but unfortunately, more and more people are losing their sense of identity in a world overwhelmed by brand names.
Whether or not an item is a brand-name product often plays a vital role in customers decision making.
A survey was recently conducted to find out how brand names influenced peoples shopping choices.
The results showed that roughly forty percent of those questioned agreed that the brand was more crucial than all the other factors.
So, the question is this: Why do so many people prefer brand-name products?
One of the biggest impacts is probably commercial advertising featuring entertainment and sports celebrities.
Their endorsements of these brands send one message to the public: Image is important.
Many people today believe owning brand-name products helps to strengthen their self-image and increase their confidence.
They feel good about themselves while wearing, using, or eating brand-name items.
For instance, some think they look slimmer and more attractive in jeans from a company that has hired famous models as its brand ambassadors.
Others trust only Nike or Adidas shoes, for they believe their feet will not be suitably protected in shoes without those brand names.
Still others insist that only drinks sold by Starbucks provide them with the refreshment they need.
Ironically, this blind belief in the power of brand names actually reflects a persons lack of self-confidence, and it definitely doesnt contribute to the establishment of a positive self-image.
When people buy designer goods, they buy into an image created by advertisers.
When people respond to the advertisements and buy such products, they want to signal their value or uniqueness through the value or uniqueness of the brand.
Whats more, purchasing designer goods enables people to hide behind an image created by others because they dont have the independence or originality to create their own image or style.
This phenomenon is particularly evident in teenagers who pay special attention to their appearance.
The impact of designer clothes on the young seems to be more tremendous than that of any other type of clothing.
Some young people believe that the only way they can make a good impression on others is to dress in designer clothing.
These days, a majority of teenagers who like to wear brand-name clothes express themselves by what they wear on the outside.
Although the quality of the materials and cuts of designer clothes often go beyond those of lower-priced versions of the same garment, the money that must be paid to buy designer clothes tends to far exceed their real cost.
As a matter of fact, seventy-five percent of the often high purchase price is for the logo alone.
However, as more and more people are starting to get at the cause of such high prices, they finally see the light that it is unwise to buy designer clothes, simply to prove their own worth.
So, do you still have a good reason for choosing expensive brand-name products?
