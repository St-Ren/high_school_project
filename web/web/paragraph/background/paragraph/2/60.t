Scientists have learned a great deal in the last thirty years by studying people as they sleep.
They study the bodily characteristics that change during sleep.
They have learned that there is one kind of sleep which causes rapid eye movement (REM) and another kind with no rapid eye movement (NREM).
Sleep is divided into three stages.
In stage one, when you start to go to sleep, you have a pleasant floating feeling.
In stage two you sleep more deeply, and a noise will probably not wake you.
In stage three, the brain waves are less active.
This third stage is when you dream, and REM tends to signal that we are dreaming.
For the rest of the night, you alternate between REM and NREM sleep.
Sleep is a biological need, but your brain never really sleeps.
The things that were on your mind during the day are still there at night.
They appear as dreams.
Researchers say that normal people may have four or five REM periods of dreaming each night.
The first one may begin only a half hour after they fall asleep, and the final one may last up to an hour.
Nightmares usually occur toward dawn.
Besides dreaming, snoring is also common in ones sleep.
There are lots of jokes about snoring, but it isnt really funny.
People snore because they have trouble breathing while they are asleep.
Some snorers have a condition called apnea.
They stop breathing up to thirty or forty times an hour because the throat muscles relax too much and block the airway.
After a period of time, the brain will signal the person to start breathing again.
This pattern is often accompanied by snoring.
This is a dangerous condition, because once the brain is without oxygen for four minutes there will be permanent brain damage.
Sleep apnea can also cause irregular heartbeats, high blood pressure, and a general lack of energy.
Most people need from seven and a half to eight and a half hours of sleep a night, but this varies with each individual.
Babies sleep eighteen hours, and older people need less sleep than younger people.
If someone continually sleeps longer than normal for no apparent reason, there may be something physically or psychologically wrong.
What should you do if you have trouble sleeping?
Lots of people take sleeping pills, but these are dangerous because they can be addictive.
If you take them for several weeks, it is hard to stop taking them.
Doctors say the best thing is to try to relax and to avoid bad habits.
Caffeine keeps people awake, so dont drink anything with caffeine in the evening.
Sleep is important to humans.
In an average lifetime, 220,000 hours are spent sleeping, so we need to understand everything we can about sleep.
Sweet dreams!
