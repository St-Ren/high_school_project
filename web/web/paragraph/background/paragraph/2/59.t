A different face of Taiwan comes alive with the night falling over towns and cities of Taiwan.
Street stalls, sidewalk vendors and small canteens create a special scene of Taiwans night life.
Your trip to Taiwan will never be complete without paying a visit to night markets. They offer you a good chance to shop for bargains as well as to feel the pulse of Taiwans night life.
You can simply enjoy yourself shopping, eating, and strolling with your friends in the cool of the evening.
Every night market has its own specialties.
If you plan to spend only a short time in Taiwan, I suggest that you begin with Taiwanese cuisine in the Shihlin Night Market in Taipei.
It is my favorite night market and you can find the islands best-known snacks there.
Now just see what Ive got for you.
Bun in a Bun (Da Bing Bao Xiao Bing)
Da Bing Bao Xiao Bing, one of the most famous snacks, is surely something you cant miss at the Shihlin Night Market.
Da bing in Chinese means a bigger bun, and xiao bing means a smaller one.
It is called bun in a bun because inside the big bun there is a crispy xiao bing. Or you could say the small bun is wrapped in the da bing. With this snack you will have many different choices.
My favorite is sweet peanuts with salty curry.
Just the sound of this crispy snack makes my mouth water.
Super-Sized Huge Chicken Steak (Hao Da Ji Pai)
Hao Da Chicken Steak is said to be the earliest chicken steak in Taiwan.
If you see a row of these golden chicken steaks, dont be shocked by their size.
(Each one might be larger than a persons face).
Have a bite and youll find the skin crispy, the meat tender and juicy.
Stir-Fried Squid (Sheng Chao Hua Zhi)
As you can see, sliced fresh squid is stir-fried with garlic, sliced bamboo shoots, and amazing spices of all kinds.
Within seconds it will be on your table.
This dish has a very special taste because everything is boiled in a thick soup.
Sweet and sour in taste, Sheng Chao Hua Zhi will really satisfy you.
Shihlin Big Sausages
(Shihlin Da Xiangchang)
This snack looks like a hot dog but is much bigger.
Dont be shocked by the huge barbecued sausage.
If you are willing to pay more, why not try the deluxe one?
Its past midnight now and Ive only put a few of the many snacks available at Shihlin Night Market on my night-market blog.
There are many other special dishes, including frogs eggs (Dont worry!
They dont come from real frogs!
), oyster omelets, and stinky tofu.
If my stomach were as huge as the Titanic, I would love to try everything in a single visit.
Next time you come to Taiwan, make sure you save a night or two for a visit to our exciting night markets.
They never sleep!
