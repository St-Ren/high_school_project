Unit 6  Positive Thinking and Happier Living.
During the spring semester of 2006, Harvard Universitys Sanders Theatre swarmed with students every Tuesday and Thursday.
More than eight hundred Harvard students majoring in different subjects had enrolled in Tal Ben-Shahars course called Positive Psychology to explore the secret of happiness.
This course became the most popular one that semester, and Ben-Shahar later went on to publish several best-selling books to help people achieve happiness.
Obviously, how to be happy is important not only to Harvard students but also to many other people around the world.
Indeed, it seems that more and more people begin to feel confined in this fast-paced, increasingly competitive world.
Students may come under pressure from their parents to reach high academic standards.
As for adults, not only do many find it challenging to obtain a fulfilling career, but they also have a hard time striking a balance between their work and personal lives.
What about parents?
They need to handle many stressful situations, such as how to communicate effectively with their children and how to provide their children with a better living or learning environment.
There is little doubt that happiness has become a burning issue for people in many different stages of their lives.
If we ask Ben-Shahar what happiness is, hell say that happiness is a state we cant arrive at unless we take account of the following three questions: What do we find most meaningful?
What provides us with the most pleasure?
Finally, what are we good at?
To help us find happiness, Ben-Shahar offers six precise tips:
Give yourself permission to be human.
We wont feel happy unless we accept all of our emotions, including the negative ones.
For students who get low grades at school, its OK to feel disappointed.
We dont have to suppress how we feel all the time.
Do work and other activities that give you pleasure and provide you with meaning.
Engaging in activities that are personally significant and enjoyable can bring us a lot of pleasure.
If you like to travel and entertain people with stories, try working as a tour guide.
You may find your job interesting, and, most importantly, you may find that you are confident and professional in your work.
Happiness depends mostly on your state of mind.
Ben-Shahar states that our happiness stems from both positive and negative experiences.
Suppose a man loses his job.
What can he do?
He can view it as a catastrophe, or he can think positively and take it as an opportunity to get a better job.
Simplify your daily tasks.
Happiness can be found in avoiding doing too much.
Dont pack excess activities into one day.
Usually, theres not enough time to finish everything we list, and failing to complete the tasks as planned can frustrate us.
Pay attention to your body.
When were tired, hungry, or physically inactive, we may end up compromising our happiness.
Thus, we should exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and eat balanced meals to make sure that we are both physically and mentally healthy.
Express gratitude, whenever possible.
Dont take what you have for granted.
Learn to appreciate and relish the wonderful things in lifeeven just a smile from a stranger.
Apparently, Ben-Shahars advice shows us that positive thinking is the key to happiness.
It can be something largethe feeling of joy upon winning a big sports competition; or smallgetting satisfaction from a task finally completed.
Whats more, its also important for us to stop envying what others have and to focus on what we alone can take pleasure in during our search for happiness.
One thing is clearfinding happiness can be a joyous lifetime pursuit.
