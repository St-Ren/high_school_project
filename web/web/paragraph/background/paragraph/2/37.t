Some poets may play with rhymes to make poems fun to read.
Others may use beautiful language to declare their love in romantic verses.
Still others compose poems to show their talent for storytelling.
They do so by telling stories in fewer words but with more meanings.
When writing a story in the form of poetry, poets carefully choose their words and leave only the most crucial clues.
If readers are good detectives, inquisitive and also imaginative , they will be able to piece together the whole story.
So as you read, you must keep asking questions, pay attention to unusual details, and try to find the answers from the clues.
To better understand a narrative poem, we can start with an analysis of some basic elements of stories: the setting, the characters or the speaker, and the plot .
Here are some questions that you may ask about these elements:
 About the setting:
When and where is the story taking place?
What is the situation?
 About the characters or the speaker:
Who are the characters in the story?
What traits do you think they have?
Who might be the speaker that tells you the story?
What is the tone of the speaker?
 About the plot:
What do you think may happen to the characters?
What problem(s) do they have?
What do they do to deal with it/them?
The following are two narrative poems, each telling a unique story.
Now you may use what you have learned above to read the stories told in the form of poems on the next page.
When I Was One-and-Twenty
hen I was one-and-twenty
I heard a wise man say,
Give crowns and pounds and guineas
But not your heart away;
Give pearls away and rubies
But keep your fancy free.'
But I was one-and-twenty,
No use to talk to me.
When I was one-and-twenty
I heard him say again,
The heart out of the bosom
Was never given in vain;
'Tis paid with sighs a plenty
And sold for endless rue.'
And I am two-and-twenty,
And oh, 'tis true, 'tis true.
E. Housman(-)
n the house
of Mr. and Mrs.
he and she
would watch teevee
and never a word
between them spoken
until the day the set was broken
Then "How do you do?"
said he to she,
"I don't believe we've met yet.
Spouse is my name.
What's yours?"
"Why, mine is the same!"
said she to he,
"Do you suppose that we could be?"
But then the set came suddenly right about
And so they never did find out.
