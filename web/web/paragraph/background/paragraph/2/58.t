The Future Body Network.
Are you tired of cables that spread all over your desk and make your Coke tumble over onto your keyboard?
If so, you may consider using devices that use technologies like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
Neither of them sends data through cables.
It sounds perfect, doesnt it?
But this is not the end of the story.
Scientists are now trying to use the human body to do a similar job.
They have come up with the idea of sending data over the small electric field on the surface of the skin.
To do this, a transmitter could be built into your pocket or a portable device like an MP player.
This transmitter would then use your skins electrical field to send data to a receiving device.
Since this kind of transmission has a range of only twenty centimeters, the receiver would have to be close to some part of your body.
By using this body network, you wouldnt need a cable to link your MP player in your pocket to the headphones in your ears, or to send to your computer the pictures from a digital camera hanging around your neck.
Moreover, you can exchange electronic cards with others by shaking hands, trade music files by dancing cheek to cheek, or swap phone numbers just by kissing.
Now, here comes a question.
Why would anyone bother networking through their body when Wi-Fi and Bluetooth already exist?
The answer lies in the fact that with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, it is hard to limit the signals only to your own use.
In a busy place, you can never know who might steal your information.
In contrast, body networking is safer.
It is hard for other people to pick up signals sent over the surface of your skin since this body network only extends twenty centimeters from your body.
Thus, no one else can easily pick up and interpret your signals.
Moreover, the most important use of body networking in the future may well be communication within the body rather than just on its surface.
Imagine having a number of small devices implanted under your skin and using them to control your own nervous system.
In other words, imagine that you possess and control a powerful in-body computer.
What do you think of this idea?
Does it sound cool, like being a character in the movie RoboCop?
Or would you prefer to be just a normal human being?
