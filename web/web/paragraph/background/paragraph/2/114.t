Unit 9 A Glimpse into the future.
Fifty years ago, most people lived their lives without color TV sets, cell phones, personal computers, and digital cameras.
Little did they know that these appliances and electronic devices would someday come into being, not to mention the fact that they would become so important in modern life.
Today, however, thanks to the huge amount of progress made as a result of technological developments, we are allowed a glimpse into the near future.
Computers have come a long way since the latter half of the 20th century and have had a great influence on us.
Interestingly, sci-fi movies sometimes give us clues about what computers in the future will be like.
In Iron Man, Jarvis, the mainframe in Tony Starks home laboratory, is equipped with a user interface to verbally and visually interact with Stark.
Jarvis seems to be more advanced than all the other computers that we can ever imagine.
Now, we are already reaping the benefits of the touch screen, though a mouse and keyboard is still used to input most instructions to a computer.
Yet, with the steady progress in computer technology, we dont need to type in commands to operate our computers, nor do we need to press mouse buttons to copy, delete, or highlight certain information.
Perhaps in another decade, we will simply speak to or gesture at a computer and then receive immediate responses from itXjust like what weve seen in Iron Man.
The hologram is another cutting-edge special effect in sci-fi movies that blows us away.
In Avatar, Jake Sully sat in his wheelchair, observing the Home Tree of Pandora presented by this technology.
Researchers have developed holography to display three-dimensional images that can be viewed from 360 degrees.
Currently, we can see holograms on some stickers and CD or DVD covers.
In the future, those who take driving lessons can practice driving with images of heavy traffic from a projector surrounding them, and they will learn how to deal with turns and corners in virtual reality.
In history or art class, the classroom will be turned into a museum whenever teachers need examples of the Bronze Age or Dadaism.
Even when we feel like going swimming, we can go scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef right in our houses.
All in all, futuristic devices prepare us for a better tomorrow.
Nevertheless, the fact that energy resources are running out is a worrisome problem.
It is vital that we conserve energy resources and meanwhile explore alternative ones that are not harmful to the environment.
Heres one green and attractive idea: miniature power plants.
With solar panels on the roof of a house, the suns rays can be easily converted to electricity.
With small wind turbines on our balconies, we can use the power of the wind to generate electricity as well.
Only when the sun is not shining or the wind not blowing will we have to pay a power company for electricity.
In fact, the idea of miniature power plants has been developed and put into action in some countries.
If it is carried out worldwide, we will become self-sufficient in energy.
Moreover, we can sell any surplus electricity and earn an extra profit.
In the dynamic world where we live, the only constant thing is change.
We dont know exactly what the future will bring us, but we can be sure that people will continue to come up with bright ideas for improving the way we live.
In the future, the devices our grandchildren use will probably be much better than all the technology we have todayXeven better than the ones mentioned above.
