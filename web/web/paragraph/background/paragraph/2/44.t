Portuguese sailors dubbed Taiwan "Ilha Formosa," which means "beautiful island," when they first saw it in 1.
Since then, "Formosa" has been the unofficial name of Taiwan.
But did you know that there is another Formosa on the banks of the Paraguay River in Argentina, on the other side of the earth?
A group of 1th-century Spanish sailors was searching for the Sierra del Plata, or "Mountain Range of Silver," which they believed was hidden somewhere in South America.
They saw a spot which they thought was so beautiful that they stopped to build a city there.
Both the city and the province were named Formosa.
By remarkable coincidence, the province of Formosa in Argentina is antipodal to the Formosa in Asia.
This means these two places are located exactly opposite each other on the globe.
Imagine a science fiction movie in which someone starts digging straight down into the ground in Taiwan.
After he or she drills all the way through the earth, he or she will end up in Formosa, Argentina, on the other side!
Despite this special connection, the two Formosas are quite different in terms of their geography and climate.
The island of Taiwan, shaped tens of millions of years ago by continuous tectonic movements, lies in a complex area between two plates and has a unique natural environment.
Two-thirds of its 3, square kilometers are covered by mountains with dense forests, some of which rise hundreds of meters above sea level.
The mountains, valleys, rivers, and reefs are home to hundreds of local species.
This gives Taiwan a spectacular landscape and a wide variety of wildlife.
In contrast, most of Formosa, Argentina, which has a total area of 7, square kilometers, is relatively flat, covered with forests, grasslands, and marshes.
In the eastern part of the country, it rains more, and thus there are forests and streams that are populated with unique types of animals.
The rest of Formosa is drier, especially in the winter, though the western region is heavily forested.
As for their economies, the two Formosas also present us with a clear contrast.
While Taiwan used to be a relatively unknown place whose main economic activities were rice farming and fishing, it has developed at an impressive speed in the last few decades.
Present-day Taiwan is renowned worldwide for its lively economy and advanced information technology and industry.
On the other hand, Formosa is one of the poorest provinces in Argentina, mainly due to its history and climate.
Its economy is primarily based on cattle-raising and other agricultural activities such as growing cotton and fruit-bananas in particular.
Ranching is especially important to the economy.
The total number of cattle in Formosa exceeds 1. million head, more than three times the size of its human population.
Due in part to the government's emphasis on tourism, Taiwan is now known around the world for its great natural beauty and its friendly people.
It is now a destination which appeals to tourists from all over the world.
In contrast, Argentina's Formosa has never been a popular tourist destination.
However, with today's advanced information technology and airplanes, more people will be able to get to know this beautiful place.
Thanks to the Portuguese and Spanish sailors who explored many different parts of the world, there are now two "beautiful" locations for people to visit.
Whether it is Argentina's Formosa with its green plains and lush forests, or Taiwan with its bustling cities and mountain landscapes, both places are sure to impress visitors.
Perhaps the residents of these two lands on opposite sides of the world can get to know each other better as well!
