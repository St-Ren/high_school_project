Jason Wu ordered a pizza at his apartment and sat down with his friends to watch TV on the day of President Barack Obama's inauguration.
"How good-looking is my wife?"
President Obama praised.
Wu turned, only to discover that the ivory chiffon gown the First Lady was wearing on TV was actually one of his creations.
The body-hugging dress showed off Michelle Obama's slim figure and the white color flattered her dark skin tone.
Overwhelmed, Wu immediately phoned his parents, and when his mother answered, he said tearfully, "Mom!
I made it!
No one will ever laugh at us again."
The dress caught the world's attention and had everyone asking: "Who is this Jason Wu?"
Wu is a Manhattan-based Asian-American fashion designer.
Born in Taiwan, he moved to Canada with his family at the age of nine.
As a child, Wu was shy and reserved.
Unlike most other boys who played sports or video games, Wu was fascinated by dolls and their clothing.
He would even ask his mother to take him to bridal stores so he could sketch the gowns on display.
At first, Wu's mother dismissed this unusual interest as a childhood phase and hoped that it would eventually pass.
But when she saw her son's talent and realized this was his passion, she encouraged him to strive for his dreams.
To avoid the inquiring eyes of relatives, she even converted the basement into a workroom for him.
Wu's mother did not force him to study but placed more emphasis on developing values like kindness and humility.
Had his mother not supported him, Wu would never have been able to pursue and realize his dreams.
In addition to his mother's support, Wu's sheer determination and hard work also contributed to his success.
When he moved to Canada, he had to juggle studying English and learning how to sew, draft patterns and sketch designs.
Sometimes he would lose his patience while sewing; sometimes he would become frustrated and discouraged.
But he never gave up.
At age fifteen, he submitted his designs and won a fashion doll design contest.
Within two years, he was named the creative director of Integrity Toys, a $ million high-end doll company.
As a university freshman, Wu started working part-time at a restaurant patronized by many fashion designers.
Despite already having an income from making dolls, he still insisted on working his way up to a waiter's position just so that he could get acquainted with some fashion designers and seek internship opportunities.
Wu's dedication is also reflected in his working style.
When he launched his own brand in 2, he employed only one or two people at his workroom and did the rest of the work himself in order to cut costs.
If it had not been for his perseverance, he would not have been able to achieve so much at such a young age.
He has held several fashion shows in New York and won many awards, including the much-acclaimed CFDA Swarovski Award for Womenswear.
Despite his success, Wu has not forgotten the importance of humility and the lessons his mother taught him.
His kind personality and soft-spoken manner have earned him the reputation of being a humble and polite new star in the fashion industry.
Looking at his success story, we see that it was not only his hard work and dedication but also his parents' open-minded attitude and way of teaching that made it all possible.
Thankful for his parents' support, Wu sends out the message: "I hope all parents can recognize their children's talents, fully support them, and give them the opportunity to grow and learn."
