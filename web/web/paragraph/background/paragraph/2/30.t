Going to Extremes.
Many people love sports, but some love intense and dangerous sports.
They want to push their bodies and their minds to the limit.
They want to challenge nature.
We could say that these people love to go to extremesXand thats why we call the sports they enjoy extreme sports.
Extreme sports have been around for many years.
Daring people have always loved to take part in such activities as surfing, rock climbing, hang gliding, car racing, and skydiving.
But in the past ten to fifteen years, extreme sports have taken off in many new directions.
Nowadays, you can find more and more people doing things like ski jumping, ice climbing, cliff diving, and even wingsuit diving, in which people jump from an airplane wearing a special birdman suit that allows them to fly through the sky before they parachute to the ground.
The most popular extreme sports are those seen at the annual X Games, sponsored by ESPN, or on the Extreme Sports Channel, which broadcasts to more than sixty countries and in twelve languages.
There you can find skateboarders turning and spinning off of huge ramps, bikers racing downhill at top speed, or motocross racers flying on motorcycles into the air and doing double and triple flips.
These may seem like very diverse sports, but they do have things in common.
All of them offer a feeling that we would describe as exhilarating, meaning that they are physically very exciting and thrilling.
All of them require special skills and a high level of physical fitness.
And, compared to the usual sports, all of them have a higher element of danger and risk.
Accidents, injuries, and even death do occur.
So what kind of person is willing to take such risks?
Surprisingly, according to one study, people who take part in extreme sports actually see themselves as cautious.
They are often disciplined and sometimes train for many years before they are good at their sport.
Their reward for such hard work is not only the thrill or the sense of accomplishment, but also, they say, a feeling of freedom and awareness found only in the challenges offered by extreme sports.
