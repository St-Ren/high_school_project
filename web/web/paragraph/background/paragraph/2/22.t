Tornadoes.
It was a warm spring day when the Newport family began to hear a very loud and faraway sound from their farm in southern Kansas.
Moments later, they saw a swirling cloud.
As it came closer, it grew darker and darker.
The winds grew stronger.
The house began to shake.
Trees were being knocked down.
As soon as they realized the danger they were facing, the parents rushed their five children into the cellar below the kitchen.
When the children came out a few minutes later, they found their entire home blown away.
If they had not been safely protected below the ground, they would surely have died.
Their parents were not so lucky.
Their bodies were found several hundred yards away.
The Newport family had been the unlucky victims of a tornado.
Although this tragedy happened years ago, in 1932, similar stories have been told over and over since then about the destructive power of these unpredictable storms.
Every year, tornadoes cause serious problems all around the world.
In August 2005, the state of Wisconsin was hit by nearly 30 tornadoes over a period of just six and a half hours.
The storms caused about 21 million dollars in damage.
Some years earlier, in May 1996, a far more deadly outbreak of tornadoes in Bangladesh left more than 700 dead and 30,000 injured.
Tornadoes are essentially funnels of air rotating as fast as 300 miles per hour.
Of course, not all tornadoes are so dangerous.
Many more are small storms that form quickly and disappear, causing little or no damage.
Such small tornadoes occur in many places around the world, even in southern Taiwan, where several are usually reported every spring.
It is, however, the big tornadoes that receive the most attention.
These bring not only death and destruction, but also stories of strange phenomenaXflocks of dead birds dropping out of the sky, chickens still alive but with all of their feathers gone, pieces of straw stuck in trees.
In a 1999 U.S. storm, violent winds from one tornado lifted a church into the air and dropped it onto a house.
In the same storm, a baby was whipped from its mothers arms and, miraculously, found alive in a nearby tree.
What makes tornadoes so dangerous is not just their great power but also their unpredictable nature.
Although scientists now know a great deal about tornadoes, they still cannot determine exactly when and where one will form.
In addition, the path of a tornado can also be impossible to predict.
It is unlikely to move in a straight line, and will often turn quickly.
A tornado might blow down a line of houses, then suddenly lift up and leave one home unhurt, then touch back down and destroy the rest of the line.
To better understand tornadoes, scientists have developed special heavy-duty vehicles and weather-monitoring equipment that allow them to make close-up observations of these dangerous storms.
Radar equipment is put on trucks and driven near a tornado, where it records wind speeds and other weather data.
Scientists often have to drive the radar hundreds of miles to chase down a tornadoXa job that can be quite dangerous!
In addition, better communication and warning systems are also helping to reduce deaths and injuries in many tornado-prone areas.
Radio and television warnings as well as sirens help to alert people to potential danger.
Public awareness is also important.
When tornadoes do occur, people must act quickly.
They should move immediately to a safe place such as a basement or under a strong stairway and cover themselves with blankets or heavy coats.
A tornado can arrive so unexpectedly that a matter of seconds can mean the difference between life and death.
