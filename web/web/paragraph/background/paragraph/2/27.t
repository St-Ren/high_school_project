The 90-10 Secret.
The 90-10 secret is incredible!
However, very few know and apply this secret.
The result?
Millions of people are suffering undeserved stress, trials, problems, and heartache.
They never seem to be successful or to enjoy life.
Bad days follow bad days.
Terrible things seem to be constantly happening.
Stress, lack of joy, and broken relationships are like a smothering blanket.
Worry consumes time, anger breaks friendships, and life seems dreary and is not enjoyed to the fullest.
Does this describe you?
If so, do not be discouraged.
You can be different.
Understand and apply the 90-10 secret.
It will change your life!
This is the secret:
10 percent of life is made up of what happens to you.
90 percent of life is decided by how you react to the other 10 percent.
Let me explain.
We really have no control over 10 percent of what happens to us.
We cannot stop the car from breaking down.
The plane may be late arriving, which throws our whole schedule off.
A driver may cut us off in traffic.
You get the picture.
We have no control over this 10 percent.
The other 90 percent is different.
You determine the other 90 percent!
By your reactions.
You cannot control a red light, but you can control your reaction to it.
Dont let people fool you; you can control how you react!
Look at the following example.
Youre eating breakfast with your family.
Your daughter knocks over a cup of coffee and it spills onto your business shirt.
You have no control over what just happened.
What happens next will be determined by how you react.
You curse.
You harshly scold your daughter for knocking the coffee cup over.
She breaks down in tears.
After scolding her, you turn to your spouse and criticize him or her for placing the cup too close to the edge of the table.
A short verbal battle follows.
You storm upstairs and change your shirt.
Back downstairs you find your daughter has been too busy crying to finish breakfast and get ready for school.
She misses the bus.
Your spouse must leave immediately to run an errand.
You rush to the car and drive your daughter to school.
Because you are late, you drive 40 mph on a 30 mph street.
A police officer stops you, and after a fifteen-minute delay and throwing sixty dollars away on a speeding ticket, you arrive at the school.
Your daughter runs to the building without saying goodbye.
After arriving at the office twenty minutes late, you find that you forgot your briefcase.
Your day has gotten off to a terrible start.
As it continues, it seems to get worse and worse.
You look forward to going home.
When you arrive home, you find a small wedge in your relationship with your spouse and your daughter.
This caps off a terrible day.
Why did you have a bad day?
A) The coffee caused it.
B) Your daughter caused it.
C) The police officer caused it.
D) You caused it.
The answer is D. You had no control over what happened with the coffee.
How you reacted in those five seconds is what caused your bad day.
Here is what could have, and should have, happened.
Coffee splashes over you.
Your daughter is about to cry.
You gently say, Its OK, honey, you just need to be more careful next time. Grabbing a towel, you rush upstairs.
After slipping on a new shirt and picking up your briefcase, you come back down in time to look through the window and see your daughter getting on the bus.
She turns and waves.
You and your spouse kiss before you both go to work.
You arrive five minutes early and cheerfully greet the staff.
Your boss comments on how well your day is going.
Notice the difference?
We have two totally different scenarios.
Both started the same way, but they ended differently.
Because of how you reacted.
You now know the 90-10 secret.
Use it and take control of your life.
Dont focus on the 10 percent you cant change.
Focus on the 90 percent you can change.
