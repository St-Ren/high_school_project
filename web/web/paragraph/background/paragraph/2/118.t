Unit 12  The Journey Ahead.
I was twenty-five when I was arrested for stealing a loaf of bread to feed my starving family.
For that petty crime, I spent nineteen years in jail.
When I was discharged from prison, I was a bitter man.
I walked for miles, trying to find somewhere to rest.
By the time I reached Digne, the sun had already set, and I was hungry and exhausted.
I headed for an inn, seeking accommodation for the night.
Looking me up and down with distrust and suspicion, the owner of the inn sent a boy to the police station to inquire about me.
When the boy returned, he handed the owner a note.
From the note, the owner learned that my name was Jean Valjean and that I was an ex-convict.
As a result, he refused to let me in.
I left the inn in humiliation.
I could feel that people behind me were exchanging looks of fear and that my arrival would soon become the talk of the town.
Just as I had expected, everyone in Digne knew that I was released on parole.
Consequently, no one was willing to reach out to me, and even a glass of water was too much for me to ask for.
Cold and starving, I was left shivering in the dark.
Fortunately, the bishop of Digne took pity on me and welcomed me with open arms.
Even after he knew my true identity, this man didnt drive me out of his home as most others had done.
Instead, he invited me to stay and dine with him.
That night, though I was lucky enough to sleep in bed for the first time in nineteen years, I couldnt fall asleep.
I kept thinking about the precious silverware on the bishops dining table.
I should have thanked him for offering me food and shelter, yet I found myself deeply disturbed by the thought of how unfairly society had treated me over the past years.
After a slight hesitation, I got up, stole the silverware, and slipped away.
However, I didnt get far.
By the time it was dawn, the police had caught me and taken me back to the bishop.
Im so delighted to see you again! the bishop said to me before I could speak.
You forgot to take the candlesticks.
With my eyes nearly popping out of my head, I was stunned by his wordsXthe bishop had not only forgiven me for my crime but also wanted me to have his only possession of value.
After the police left, the bishop told me, Everyone deserves a second chance.
Promise me that you will use this silver to become an honest man. He continued solemnly, Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good.
It is your soul that I am buying for you, and I give it to God!
I left the bishops house and roamed the countryside.
My thoughts were on my dreadful days in prison and on my wasted life.
I was upset and angry.
But as I brooded over my misery, the bishops words flashed through my mind.
All at once, my anger and gloom somehow vanished.
The bishops love and forgiveness had cast out my hatred for the world.
From that moment on, I was truly free.
I, Jean Valjean, became a changed man and never committed another crime.
