Unit 2  No Escape from the Web.
Have you ever run into trouble trying to contact a friend you have long lost touch with?
In the past, people didnt have effective solutions to this problem.
Asking mutual friends seemed to be the only way to handle this matter, and it often took ages.
Today, however, all you need to do is simply go online, upload a picture of your friend, and provide information about his or her background.
Soon, you will find this friend.
How could this possibly happen?
The answer definitely lies in the rapid development of online communities and the crucial role they play in the search process.
Nowadays, many people are deeply involved in online communities, and some have become netizens.
They post opinions online, upload and download files, and make online friends.
These netizens spend a great deal of time engaging in various online activities in this virtual world.
The footprints they have left on the Web thus become clues that allow Internet users to find almost anyone or anything they want.
Such ways of searching are known as human flesh search.
An example of this occurred in Taiwan when a man mistreated a dog.
Chained to a fire hydrant and beaten badly, this dog howled miserably while the man laughed loudly.
The entire incident was recorded and uploaded online.
This 17?second video fueled general anger.
Carrying out human flesh search, some netizens started to track down this man.
In just 18 hours, they collected plenty of information about this man and reported him to Animal Rescue Team Taiwan.
In the end, he was forced to apologize publicly for what he had done and promise that this would never happen again.
Nevertheless, human flesh search doesnt always lead to happy endings.
In the U.S.A., a twelve-year-old girl committed suicide after being bullied over the Internet for months.
The girl got into trouble with some schoolmates one year before the tragedy happened, and the bullying began not only at school but also on the Net.
At first, the girl complained to her parents about it, and they allowed her to stay home from school in the hope of stopping the situation from worsening.
Meanwhile, the girl changed her screen name, deleted her Facebook account, and decided to switch schools for the new semester.
Unfortunately, those cyber-bullies found the victim through different social media sites and continued making nasty remarks about her, and even using abusive language against her.
Since the girl was unable to stand the torture of being bullied anymore, she killed herself to end her misery.
Based on the instances above, it is no wonder that the Los Angeles Times once commented that human flesh search engines might overshadow the FBI, since a group of netizens might be more efficient than any agent could ever possibly be.
Yet, whether this way of searching is right remains a question.
When netizens are trying to discover the truth about something or bring someone to justice, some of them might violate the privacy of other Internet users.
Even worse, a few may become a violent cybermob, taking advantage of their freedom of speech to pursue their so-called justice. Netizens should avoid doing these things so that everyone can enjoy the convenience that the Internet provides.
After all, the Internet should be used to connect people rather than separate them or, whats worse, make them suffer.
