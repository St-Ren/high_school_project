In her room, Kate is sitting in front of her laptop, busy typing her report.
Halfway through, she surfs the Internet for some information she needs while downloading a new online game from a website.
She clicks the mouse with her right hand, her other hand picking up the phone to answer an incoming call.
Talking happily, Kate directs her attention back to the computer and starts to play the game she has finished downloading.
She keeps switching between tasks like this, with music playing all the while on her MP player.
Life today moves faster than ever.
Like many other people around the world, Kate uses new technology to make the maximum use of her time.
In today's world, people are becoming experts at multitasking, that is, the art of doing several things at once.
Electronic multitasking is not new, of course: people have been driving cars and listening to the radio at the same time for more than eighty years.
But there is no denying that this phenomenon has become much more widespread and much more intense in the era of Web-enabled computers.
Nowadays, new technology makes many daily tasks more efficient.
E-mail, Skype, portable laptop computers, cell phones, MP players, and other entertainment devices such as tablets and eBook systems all make it easier to communicate with others and get information quickly.
But when technology allows us to "save" time on one task, we often fill the time saved with another activity.
As a result, more and more people-members of the younger generation in particular-are dividing their attention between multiple tasks performed at the same time.
But is multitasking a good habit or a harmful one?
The obvious advantage of multitasking is that it makes performing daily tasks more efficient.
With the help of those high-tech devices, we are able to access information and communicate more quickly and easily.
But increased multitasking has its dangers.
Researchers warn that the mental habit of dividing one's attention into many small slices can reduce the quality and depth of one's reasoning.
With less practice in sustained concentration on one issue, a person might gradually lose the ability to think through a complex problem or do creative work.
His or her understanding of the world could become more superficial.
Another danger is that multitasking gadgets can influence our relationships.
A professor at UCLA's Center on Everyday Lives of Families says that these devices enable family members to retreat into their own individual worlds: "When the working parent comes home at night, his or her spouse and the kids are so absorbed in what they're doing that they don't give the arriving parent the time of day."
Both researchers and the public debate the advantages and disadvantages of multitasking.
On the one hand, we can enjoy increased speed and efficiency; on the other hand, we may be unable to concentrate and possibly damage our relationships.
As in other areas of modern life, people must learn how to strike a balance between both the advantages and the potentially harmful impact of all the new technology.
