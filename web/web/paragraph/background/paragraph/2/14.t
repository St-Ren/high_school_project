The Man Who Took Starbucks to the World.
The Great Good Place is a short story by American novelist Henry James, first published in 1900.
Its theme is that people need a place where they can escape the grind of daily life.
This was an idea that Howard Schultz, the man who turned the Starbucks coffee chain into an international giant, used in his business strategy.
Born in 1952, Schultz grew up in Brooklyn, New York.
After university, he went to work for a firm that supplied coffee-making equipment.
Not long after he began working there, Schultz noticed that a company in Seattle was buying a surprisingly large amount of the firms equipment, and he decided to investigate.
It turned out to be a simple coffee-bean store, but its owners were dedicated to teaching the public to appreciate good coffee.
This store in Seattle had opened in 1971 and taken its name from Starbuck, a sailor in the classic novel Moby-Dick.
Its logo was a two-tailed mermaid.
Fascinated by its owners dedication to coffee, Schultz joined Starbucks.
Later, on a trip to Europe, he was impressed by the way that street caf?s in Italy were both meeting points and places to drink espresso.
This was something America didnt have yet.
In 1985 Schultz set up his own coffee-bar business, which soon became a success.
Two years later, he got together with some other investors and bought Starbucks for US$3.8 million.
Adopting the name and logo, Schultz developed a marketing strategy that turned ordinary caf?s into fashionable outlets for coffee.
He used clever gimmicks, such as selling coffee in short, tall, and grande sizes rather than the usual small, medium, and large.
Customers learned to pronounce unfamiliar Italian names like latte and macchiato.
Schultz actually created a market that hadnt existed before.
Within twenty years, Schultz had taken coffee culture from the streets of Europe to just about every city in the developed world.
Today, tens of millions of people a week visit Starbucks locations in countries all over the globe.
Clearly, these customers are happy with the great good place that Howard Schultz has built.
