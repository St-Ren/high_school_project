Would you like to live on a tropical island for six months, soak up the sun, swim with the fishes, and get paid a salary of 1, Australian dollars (US$,) for doing all these?
You may have trouble believing this, but that is exactly what 3-year-old Ben Southall, an adventurer and fundraiser from Britain, had to do when he won the "Best Job in the World" contest.
In January 2, Tourism Queensland started a contest to find an "island caretaker" for Hamilton Island in the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, Australia.
Applications for the job came from all over the world-over 3, people from 2 countries applied for the position.
Applicants had to submit a 6-second video expressing why they were the best candidates for the job.
Some applicants chose to talk about their work, while others decided to show their bizarre side.
For example, one applicant from Singapore put on a wetsuit and quizzed people about the Great Barrier Reef on the streets and on trains.
Southall chose to show his fun and adventurous side.
In his video, he told about how he had travelled all over Africa, climbed mountains, gone bungee jumping, and even ridden an ostrich.
His video was humorous and straight to the point, winning him the chance to compete as one of the finalists.
For the final stage, 1 competitors were selected by a jury; one of them, an interpreter from Taiwan, was a "wild card" applicant chosen by popular vote.
The judges considered it vital for the winner to have a great enthusiasm for nature and a true passion for Queensland.
They were also looking for someone who was creative, funny, outgoing, and great at communicating.
Southall possessed all these qualities and also managed to impress the judges in the final stage, thus securing his place as the top candidate.
After he was declared the winner of the contest, Southall became a celebrity overnight.
His daily responsibilities as the caretaker of the island involved exploring the plants and the wildlife, feeding the fish, and performing other interesting duties.
He also had to share his experiences and thoughts with the world through weekly posts on his blog, which was widely read by people interested in the beauty of the island.
Although his job may seem like a vacation to many, Southall said that it was not as easy as it might sound; in fact, he had a busy schedule on the island and even encountered dangerous situations.
Just days away from the end of his job as a caretaker, he was stung by a poisonous Irukandji jellyfish.
Fortunately, he was treated immediately before his condition worsened.
Despite this minor setback, he was soon back on his feet, resuming his routine activities.
After his six-month stay on the island came to an end, Southall became the ambassador for Tourism Queensland.
He travelled the world to promote and praise the beauty of the area.
He was even interviewed by Oprah Winfrey over Skype.
In his interviews, he said that his experience gave him a better understanding of how important the Great Barrier Reef's ecosystem is and why people should preserve it by adopting a more eco-friendly lifestyle.
He also urged people to expand their horizons, try new things, and develop a global view: "Take on the world today, dream a little and book that flight you've been thinking about taking."
