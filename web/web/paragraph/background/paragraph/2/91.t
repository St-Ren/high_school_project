Many people regard men and women as belonging to different cultures.
This is shown in the differences of masculine and feminine styles of communication.
To understand this issue, consider the following cases of cultural difference in communication between the genders.
Gender Gaps in Communication
Case I: Showing support
Rita is having dinner with her boyfriend, Mike.
She is worried about a friend who drinks a lot.
When Mike advises her to get her friend into counseling, Rita repeats how worried she feels.
Mike then tells Rita to make sure her friend does not drive after drinking.
Rita explodes  saying that she does not need advice.
Irritated  at her lack of appreciation for his help, Mike asks, Then why did you talk about it With anger, Rita responds, Oh, never mind, Ill talk to Betty.
At least she cares how I feel.
Case II: Giving feedback.
Roseanne and Drew are colleagues in an advertising company.
One morning he drops into her off?ice to tell her about an idea for an advertisement.
As Drew presents his ideas, Roseanne nods and responds with Um, Uh huh, and Yes. When he finishes and asks for her comments, Roseanne says, I really dont think that plan will sell the product. Confused, Drew responds, Then why were you agreeing the whole time I was telling you my idea Completely confused, Roseanne responds, What makes you think I was agreeing with you?
Case III: Expressing feelings.
Dedrick and Melita have been dating for two years and are very serious about their relationship.
To celebrate their anniversary, Melita wants to spend a quiet evening in her apartment where they can be together.
However, when Dedrick arrives, he has already planned a dinner out followed by a concert.
Melita feels hurt that he does not want to talk and be close.
Who is right?
It is easy for people to make judgments and to perceive differences as better or worse, not simply as different.
But judging is not the best way to communicate.
Understanding Cross-Gender Communication
Trying to respect unique styles of communication might be more productive than judging one another.
Men and women typically rely on distinct communication rules and have different ways of showing support, interest, and caring.
This implies they may perceive the same communication in different ways.
In the f?irst situation, Rita talks to Mike about her concern for her friend primarily because she wants him to respond to her feelings.
She sees this as a way to feel closer to him.
However, Mike views communication as an instrument to get things done, so he tries to help by giving advice, which causes Rita to feel that he does not care at all about her feelings.
In the second example, it is obvious that women give lots of response cuesXverbal and nonverbalXto indicate interest in conversation and build relationships.
culture, however, focuses on outcomes more than processes, so men tend to use feedback to signal specific agreement and disagreement.
When Drew hears Roseannes ums,  uh huhs, and yeses, he assumes she is agreeing.
In the last example, Dedrick and Melita also experience a culture clash in their communication.
Within feminine culture, talking is a wayXprobably the primary wayXto express feeling close.
In contrast, men generally experience closeness in doing. A man is more likely to express his feelings for a woman by doing something concrete for her (washing her car) or doing something with her (skiing), than by talking explicitly about how or what he feels.
Incorrect translations result in most problems in cross-gender communication.
When we understand there are distinct gender cultures and when we respect each, we help ourselves to communicate in ways that make our relationships better.
