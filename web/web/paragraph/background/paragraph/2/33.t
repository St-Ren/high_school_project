It seems that counting is as easy as 1, 2, 3; however, it is not an inborn ability but an acquired one.
According to studies, we are only born to identify the patterns of groups of things.
In fact, it took human beings thousands of years to learn how to count with numbers.
Before complicated counting systems were developed, people kept track of things through a tallying system.
If a shepherd had twenty sheep, he would put aside twenty stones-one for each sheep.
Later, he would know if his flock was all there by matching the sheep to the stones.
Without a doubt, this method was far from perfect.
Aside from the risk of losing stones, what if there were lots of different groups of things to keep track of?
Then those "things" could soon become unmanageable.
Thankfully, around 3 B.C., abstract numbers were invented in Mesopotamia.
As the Mesopotamians began to engage in commercial activities regularly, they had to develop more accurate methods of counting.
This motivated them to invent abstract numbers.
These numbers make counting much faster because they always keep the same value.
A set of symbols, called numerals, was invented to represent the numbers.
They were little wedge-shaped patterns pressed into wet clay.
Although the Mesopotamian numerals are seldom seen today, the base- number system used by this ancient culture still exists now.
For instance, we have 6 seconds in a minute, and 6 minutes in an hour.
In geometry, there are 3 degrees in a circle.
After Mesopotamia's pioneering achievement, each civilization also developed its own number system.
Egyptian numerals were made up of little pictures, such as those of frogs and lotus flowers.
Roman numerals like I, V, X, etc., can still be found on the face of clocks, at the beginning of book chapters , and on some official documents.
In China, there was a widely used set of written numerals, called Huama, before Arabic numerals were introduced.
Today, of course, the most widely used numbers are based on the Hindu-Arabic
system; they use these familiar symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
This base- system was first developed in India and introduced into Arab culture in the 9th century.
Many people agree that 1 was chosen because human beings have 1 fingers and 1 toes; no doubt people long ago used their fingers to count up to 1-as we still sometimes do.
Any number can be expressed by using different combinations of the 1 symbols.
By 1, this system had become popular in Western Europe, and then it began to spread around the world.
We all count on numbers every day in countless numbers of ways-and we can be grateful that we don't need stones to count our sheep anymore.
