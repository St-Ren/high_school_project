Walt Disney: The Dreamer.
Disneyland, the "happiest place on Earth," opened in July 1955, but Walt Disney had begun dreaming of building it much earlier.
In the early 1940s, Disney took his daughters, Sharon and Diana, to an old and dirty amusement park.
Watching his girls ride the merry-go-round, he started to dream of building a theme park of his own, a safe and clean place where parents and children alike would be entertained.
Disney worked day and night on plans for his park.
He visited amusement parks all around the world to get ideas.
Finally, through the power of imagination, Disney created the Disneyland that we know today.
Here, visitors are swept away to a land of tropical jungles, American pioneer settlements, and storybook castles.
From a very young age, Disney loved to draw.
He created his own comic strips and dreamed of becoming a cartoonist.
He was often scolded at school for drawing instead of doing his schoolwork.
In 1923, with his brother Roy, Disney borrowed money and started the Disney Brothers' Studio in Hollywood.
The studio had only one used camera, and the restroom did double duty as a darkroom!
Things got better when one of Disney's characters, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, became popular.
Disney went to New York to ask for more money, but he was refused and was even cheated out of the copyright to Oswald.
To protect Roy from the difficult truth, Disney sent him a telegram saying, "Don't worry.
Everything OK." On his way back to Los Angeles, Disney was thinking of a replacement for Oswald and recalled a pet mouse he had once had.
This memory inspired the creation of a new character: a little fellow in red shorts named Mickey Mouse.
Mickey became a celebrity overnight.
But Disney never stopped trying to break new ground.
He then went on to create his first full-length animated movie, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Creative and highly dedicated to his work, Disney paid attention to even the smallest details.
He would work long hours each day, editing song lyrics and planning different special effects.
Many nights, he would convince his wife to sleep on his office couch while he stayed late in the studio.
His dedication paid off with the success of classic animated films like Pinocchio and Bambi.
Despite the huge popularity of Disney's films, Disneyland remains his greatest achievement.
This project, a dream come true for him, also allows millions to realize their own dreams.
Disney himself summed up the park's magic: "It has that thingXthe imagination and the feeling of happy excitementXI knew when I was a kid."
