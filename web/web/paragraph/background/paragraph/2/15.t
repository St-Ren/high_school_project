Keeping Your Brain Healthy.
The brain is one of the most complex organs in our body.
Brain matter is very soft, much like tofu, and is made up of billions of cells and trillions of nerves that send information to the rest of the body.
What can you do to keep your brain healthy?
The most important thing is to exercise it.
Playing games that use numbers and words, such as crossword puzzles and Sudoku, is a great way to keep your brain working.
Games that use more planning, such as chess and mahjong, are even better.
Creative activities, such as writing, drawing, and painting, are other great ways to stimulate your brain.
Even small things, like brushing your teeth with a different hand, could be enough to keep your brain from getting lazy and weak.
Secondly, physical exercise, such as walking, running, and swimming, can actually create new brain cells.
Studies show that people who exercise for as little as fifteen minutes every day use more of their brain power than people who do not exercise.
Team sports that require more thinking, like volleyball and soccer, make your brain work even harder.
Last but not least, what you eat can play a large part in keeping your brain healthy.
Protein, found in foods like meat, fish, milk, and soybeans, provides the basic materials for building new tissue and for keeping all your organs healthy and strong.
Fish and fish oil have omega-3 fats, which, if you think of your brain as a car, will keep it moving like a Ferrari or a Mercedes-Benz.
There are many things you can do to keep your brain healthy and active.
Learning new things, visiting new places, and playing games are the first step.
Exercising and eating well are also important.
A person is never too old or too young to start practicing these habits, so be smartXstart today!
