Being On Time.
An office meeting will start at 10:00 a.m. Hans, a German colleague, is already waiting at 9:55.
Michael, an American, arrives at 10 on the dot.
In the next five minutes a few others hurry in.
But trying everyone's patience is Raul, the visitor from Brazil.
Not until 10:30 does he walk into the office, and he doesn't even think he's late.
How people perceive time varies around the world.
Germans like arriving early.
Americans plan to arrive just on time.
Brazilians aren't bothered by being a half hour late.
And many people don't even keep track of the exact time.
Even though cultural attitudes toward time differ greatly, all cultures can be put into one of two groups: time-oriented and event-oriented.
Time-oriented cultures put more emphasis on schedules, while event-oriented cultures think that what happens is more important than when it happens.
The Western world, particularly North America and Western Europe, is strongly time-oriented.
Events take place at specific, scheduled times.
Appointments are kept to the minute, with perhaps a five-minute leeway.
In time-oriented cultures, time is like a conveyor belt that carries boxes.
Each box represents a segment of time.
One must pack as much as possible into each box before it slips past.
In other words, time must be "managed" well, or it may be "wasted."
In event-oriented cultures, meetings begin when everybody arrives and finish when all the business is done.
Events are scheduled to begin "after dinner" or simply "tomorrow."
This relaxed lifestyle is typical of people in Arab, African, Latin American, and Southeast Asian countries.
There, time is like the sun, showing up again and again.
Since time is unlimited, schedules are often put aside for even a minor reason, such as meeting someone on the street.
If travelers don't understand these different ideas about time, they will be troubled by unnecessary conflicts.
For example, American students often quickly exchange "How are you?"
and "Fine" when they rush to be punctual for classes.
But event-oriented students see this exchange as impersonal.
Before they can say anything more than "Fine," the American student has already hurried past them.
For people who believe "time is money," the slow pace of life in event-oriented lands can be frustrating.
Since time-oriented people value productivity, they might view event-oriented people as lazy or inefficient.
However, event-oriented people may feel offended when time-oriented people cut to the chase too quickly because event-oriented people prefer getting to know their associates before discussing the details of a business deal.
What can the world's travelers do to avoid these time-related conflicts?
Follow this age-old rule: "When in Rome, do as the Romans do."
