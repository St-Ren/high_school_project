A World of Hats.
Humans first wore hats to protect themselves.
The first hats were probably made of leaves and bark tied together.
But even with this simple design, the first hats served their purpose.
They helped our ancestors stay dry.
Today, there is a hat for all seasonsXand all reasons.
The national hat of France is the beret.
It came from the Basque people, who lived in the south of France.
When Frenchmen saw how great these hats looked, they started wearing them, too.
The beret is popular because it is able to say so many things, depending on how it is worn.
Worn facing forward and high on the head, the beret looks proud.
This is the way a soldier wears one.
But, worn lower and turned to the side, a beret looks playful and cute.
Its the perfect addition to a schoolgirls uniform.
Many painters and musicians love to wear berets.
In fact, people often associate the beret with artists.
The berets style is loved by people all around the world.
The hat that best represents Mexico is the sombrero.
Today, it is worn mostly by the members of mariachi bands, but this was not always so.
To understand the sombrero, imagine you are a Mexican farmer long ago.
In the fields the work is backbreaking and there isnt any shade in which to rest.
So, you invent a hat with a wide brim to supply all the shade you need.
Naming this hat isnt hard.
You simply use the Spanish word for shade!
Not all hats are worn for protection from the weather or for fashion.
Some are worn for religious reasons.
Jewish men and boys wear yarmulkes.
This small hat is about the size of a teacup saucer and covers only the top of the head.
It is worn to show respect for God.
The Jewish Bible says, Cover your head in order that the fear of heaven may be upon you. Religious Jews wont leave the house without one.
Then there is the turban.
This special head covering is worn by male Sikhs.
Their religion demands that they grow beards, carry knives, and never cut their hair.
So, to keep it tidy, these Northern Indian men wrap their hair in sheets that can be up to forty-five meters long.
Then they wind the sheets around their heads.
The result is a unique head covering and a religious symbol that is known around the world.
What you put on your head tells others something about you before you even say a word.
So if you have a message for the world, why not let a hat say it for you?
