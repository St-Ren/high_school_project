Sing with the Poets.
A poem cannot be perfect without the presence of pleasant or musical sounds.
Poets make particular choices in their arrangement of words to create musical qualities in their poetry.
Readers, when reading a poem, may feel the effects created by the sounds of those carefully selected words.
Therefore, in addition to vivid imagery or delicate, figurative language, the music of poetry can reinforce the meanings that poets wish to convey.
To produce special "sound effects" in poetry, poets make use of repetition, with the regular use of specific sounds or stressed and unstressed syllables.
This is a technique that makes a poem rhythmic.
Read the following work by Robert Frost and pay attention to the effect of the sounds within:
Nothing Gold Can Stay
by Robert Frost
Nature's first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf's a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.
Each line of the poem is made up of six syllables, except the last line.
A stressed syllable and an unstressed one form a foot, and different numbers of feet form a meter.
Therefore, each line of this short poem basically contains three feet, which conveys a balanced rhythm.
In addition, in lines like "green is gold," "hue to hold," or "dawn goes down to day," the initial consonants produce a special sound effect, called alliteration.
The momentary nature of life is expressed through these sound devices, since "dawn" soon becomes "day."
In the next poem, a similar issue is brought out through the poet's description of the passing of a day, which implies the fleeting nature of time.
For instance, "the sun kept setting, setting still" and "the dusk kept dropping, dropping still" connote the vanishing of time and life:
The Sun Kept Setting, Setting Still
by Emily Dickinson
The sun kept setting, setting still;
No hue of afternoon
Upon the village I perceived,--
From house to house 'twas noon.
The dusk kept dropping, dropping still;
No dew upon the grass,
But only on my forehead stopped,
And wandered in my face.
My feet kept drowsing, drowsing still,
My fingers were awake;
Yet why so little sound myself
Unto my seeming make?
How well I knew the light before!
I could not see it now.
'Tis dying, I am doing; but
I'm not afraid to know.
The poet, Emily Dickinson, also creates distinctive sound patterns by repeating certain words and sounds, which produces an intense rhythm and meaning.
For example, the alliteration of "sun," "setting," and "still," or of "dusk" and "dropping" intensifies the passage of time, and the repetition of the same words implies the inevitable ending of mortal life.
However, in the last stanza Dickinson would rather face death with courage than feel frightened of it.
Now, aside from the beautiful language in poetry, you can also appreciate the expressive melody of a poem.
