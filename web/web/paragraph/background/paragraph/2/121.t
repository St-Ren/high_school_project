Unit 4  For the Perfect First Date.
Youve finally made it.
Next Saturday, you will be going on a date with that special person whom youve had your eye on for quite some time, and this may be your chance to start a great romance.
But what if the date doesnt go well?
What if you blow this date?
For most people, first dates can be very stressful.
So, what can you do to increase your odds of success?
The following are some useful tips.
Have the Right Attitude
Youll find dating to be a pleasant and rewarding experience as long as you relax.
If you are under pressure to make the date a success, youll probably be too tense to make a good impression.
At the other extreme, pretending not to care at all can make things even worse.
Think of dating as simply an opportunity to get to know more about other people and yourself.
If things work out, great.
If not, youll learn from the experience and do better next time.
Smile, stay optimistic, and let yourself have fun.2.
Choose the Right Place
The usual dinner and movie is not always the best choice for a first date.
You cant get to know more about someone while your eyes are glued to a cinema screen.
In addition, if the movie happens to be awful, it might create a negative mood for the whole date.
Make the date special by going to a museum or an art gallery.
The peaceful atmosphere makes conversation easy, and you can chat about the artworks that catch your attention.
Amusement parks can also be a good choice, too, for they make most people feel energetic and carefreeXwhich is perfect for starting a romance.3.
Let Your Partner Do Most of the Talking
During a date, of course, it is necessary that you keep the conversation lively.
Although an awkward silence is never welcome, the worst thing to do is to just talk about yourself the whole time.
If you make this mistake, you may come across as either arrogant or insecure.
Try to focus the conversation on your partner and be a sympathetic listener.4.
Talk About the Right Things
A lot of people ask questions only about typical and predictable topics, such as school and family.
These questions are not bad, but if you ask only this kind of question, youll find your date yawning every ten minutes.
It is advisable that you ask some questions that demand a little thinking or lead to interesting answers.
For example, try a question like this: If you had an extra hour of free time each day, how would you spend it This kind of question helps people open up and overcome nervousness.
If it doesnt work, then try to find a topic that both of you have an interest in and let the conversation flow from there.
If you have difficulty finding any topics that you two have in common, then the chance that you two will ever have a steady relationship is probably quite slight.
Finally, dont ask or talk about previous relationships.
People who talk about their previous relationships usually havent gotten over them yet.
If you complain about your ex, your date may think you are still not ready for a new relationship.
In conclusion, respect your date and show your sincerity!
If youre not in a relationship, dont worryXa new relationship will be coming along soon.
Good luck with your first date!
