Lesson Ten   Its a New World Record!
The name Sir Hugh Beaver may not mean much to most people, but his brainchild, the Guinness World Records, is known around the world.
Here is how it all started: Sir Hugh was the managing director of the Guinness Brewery.
One day in 1951, he was hunting with some friends in Southern Ireland.
He shot at a kind of bird called the golden plover, but he missed.
Sir Hugh said that, in his opinion, the golden plover was the fastest flying game bird in all of Europe.
Some of the people in his party disagreed.
They said that the fastest game bird was another type of bird, the grouse.
Sir Hugh decided to check the facts.
He and his friends searched through many reference books in the library, but they couldnt find any information about the fastest birdXor the fastest anything, or the biggest, or the most expensive, or the oldest, and so on.
Sir Hugh had a brilliant idea.
He realized that, every day, there were hundreds of arguments similar to the one that he had had with his friends.
He decided that a thorough, reliable guide to records was needed.
Several years later, in September 1954, Sir Hugh approached Norris and Ross McWhirter.
These twin brothers operated a fact-finding agency.
Sir Hugh asked them to collect and publish a guide to records in as many fields as possible.
The McWhirter brothers opened a Guinness Records office in London, and after a year of hard work, the first slim volume was published in the U.K. By the end of the year, the book had climbed to the top of the British bestseller list.
In 1956, the Guinness Company published the record book in the United States.
It was an instant success there, too.
Updated every year, the book of Guinness World Records has sold more than ninety million copies in seventy-seven different countries and in thirty-seven languages.
In fact, the book holds a record of its own: it has sold more copies than any other book except the Bible and the Koran.
Guinness World Records has been called the worlds most readable reference book.
The records are divided into thirteen categories.
Some people use the book to settle arguments about scientific facts; others use it to resolve debates about sports.
Most people, though, enjoy looking through the book for wacky world records.
One of the most unusual is the record set by Christian Adam of Germany.
Adam rode his bicycle 60.45 kilometers while playing the violin.
More amazingly, he was riding backwards when he set this record!
Then there was David Kremmer from Wisconsin, U.S.A., who stacked ten bowling balls on top of each other, or John Evans of the U.K., who balanced a car on his head for thirty-three seconds.
For those who cannot get enough information about records from the book, there are Guinness World Records museums located throughout North America and Europe, and also in Taiwan.
The Taiwan museum is unique.
Its main hall resembles an enormous Guinness World Records book, and its snack bar looks like a giant hamburger.
You can also watch Guinness World Records: Primetime, a weekly television show, or you can visit the Guinness World Records website.
If you like, you can try to break a world record yourself.
You dont have to be strong or fast to set a new record.
If you have plenty of time, you can grow your hair to a record length.
A woman in China, whose hair is 5.627 meters long, has the current record.
Or you could break the record for getting into a bathtub with the most live venomous snakes.
Two people from the United States hold that record now.
They got into a tub with seventy-six live rattlesnakes.
Of course, even if you do officiallyreak a record, you may not make it into the pages of the book.
You may only get a certificate Thousands of records are broken annually but only a few hundred are included in the next years book.
And be careful!
The Guinness corporation takes no responsibility for accidents or injuries that may occur during your record-breaking attempt.
