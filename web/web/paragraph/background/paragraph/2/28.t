When the Cats Away, the Mice Will Play.
Cats are loved by people all over the world because of their grace, beauty, and strong, independent personalities.
The ancient Egyptians worshipped cats as gods, and today in Africa, the lion is known as king of the beasts. In the United States, cats are one of the most popular house pets, and many Americans love their cats so much that they think of them as another member of the family.
No wonder there are many English expressions that use the word cat.
The American dream, for example, is to become a fat cat, a term for a wealthy and powerful person.
But even those without a lot of money can still afford to take a cat nap, or a short rest, every now and then.
However, it is not considered good to act like a catXto cat around, playing and sleeping too much, and living an aimless or selfish life.
People have always admired cats for their athletic abilities and their sense of balance, and also for their very quiet way of doing things.
Thats why we use the term cat burglar to describe a talented thief, one who can quietly sneak away with something valuable without anyone noticing.
We also use the expression the cats got your tongue to mean you cannot speak or dont know what to say.
Because cats are such expert predators in hunting and eating smaller animals, we often talk about a game of cat and mouse, which refers to any difficult challenge that requires strategy and skill, or also one in which a powerful person is teasing or acting cruelly towards someone weaker.
When the cats away, the mice will play is another common cat idiom.
It means that when the teacher leaves the room, the students will become wild and crazy, or when a teenagers parents are out of town, he or she will invite friends over for a big party.
Because cats are often running away from dogs, American children will tease a friend who is afraid of something by calling him or her a scaredy-cat or a fraidy-cat.
Another popular name used to tease someone is copycat, used to describe a person who talks, dresses or acts just like someone else.
Another cat expression can be used when your best friend tells you an important secret: you have to remember not to let the cat out of the bag, meaning not to tell anyone else.
And be careful, because if you do tell your friends secret, the two of you could end up fighting like cats and dogs.
