Lesson Seven   An Unpunished Crime.
The first time I got caught stealing was when I was about eight years old.
My mother, older brother, and I went shopping at a department store.
While my mother and brother were looking at clothes, I went alone to the music department.
I noticed a Michael Jackson cassette and, without really thinking, put it in my pocket.
Then I went back to where my brother was, and we continued shopping.
Later, while we were driving home in the car, I decided to have a look at my new cassette.
My brother saw it and asked me where I had gotten it.
I was unable to answer, and so he immediately told my mother that I had stolen the cassette.
As soon as my mother found out what I had done, she turned the car around and we went back to the department store.
She dragged me into the store by my ear, and she made me return the cassette and apologize.
It was extremely embarrassing.
And it didnt end there.
My mother told my father and he yelled at me furiously for what seemed like forever.
For my punishment, I was grounded for the rest of the summer vacation (two whole weeks!).
The experience made me very angry, but I did learn two things that day: one, when you do something wrong, be very careful not to get caught, and two, never trust your brother.
A few years later, in middle school, I made a new friend, Andy, who was a bad influence on me.
Andy never studied and was always getting into trouble.
I thought Andy was cool and I wanted to impress him.
When I found out that he liked to shoplift, I felt I had to join him to show that I wasnt chicken. Every day after school, we would go to stores and steal candy, cassettes, poker cards, cigarettes, and anything else that we could get our hands on.
Andy liked to call it shopping with a five-finger discount.
One day, Andy and I were shoplifting in a convenience store, when suddenly a store clerk grabbed me.
She had seen me putting a cassette in my pocket (I guess I had bad luck with cassettes).
As soon as Andy saw that I was caught, he quickly left the store.
I dont blame him, as there was nothing he could do to help me.
The police arrived and took me home in a police car.
I was terrified.
The police officer talked with my mother and then left.
I expected my mother to be furious, just as she had been before, and was waiting for the severe punishment that was sure to come.
However, to my surprise, she just broke down and cried.
For a long twenty minutes, my mother just wept.
I pleaded with her to stop crying and I promised I would never steal again, but she wouldnt stop.
I had not only let her down, but I had broken her heart.
I felt terrible seeing her so distressed.
She didnt chew me out or punish me at all.
She didnt lecture me about stealing and she didnt even tell my father.
After that day, I refused to steal again and I have never stolen anything since.
Even today, if I think about stealing, I get that same sick feeling in my stomach and heart that I had the day my mother cried in front of me.
Why that non-punishment was so much more effective than the real punishment I received when I was eight years old, I am not sure, but it makes me think about how I will punish and discipline my own children when they make bad decisions.
I learned something else from that experience as well.
When I told Andy that I wouldnt shoplift again, he was OK with it and we continued to be friends just as before.
I realized then that a true friend would never pressure you to do something that is bad and would accept you for who you are.
