Blind from birth, I have never had the opportunity to see myself and have been completely dependent on the image I create in the eyes of the observer.
Many people seem to think that since I can't see, I also cannot hear.
Very often, people will converse with me at the top of their lungs, enunciating each word very carefully.
When I go to the airport and ask the ticket agent for assistance to the plane, he or she will invariably pick up the phone, call a ground hostess, and whisper: "Hi, Jane, we've got a seventy here."
I have concluded that the word blind is not used for one of two reasons: They either fear that if the dread word is spoken, the ticket agent's retina will immediately detach, or are reluctant to inform me of my condition of which I may not have been previously aware.
Others believe that I can't talk, either.
Often when my wife and I go out to dinner, a waiter or waitress will ask my wife if "he would like a drink," to which I respond that "indeed he would."
This point was driven home to me while I was studying for a diploma in law degree at Oxford University in England.
During the year I became ill and was hospitalized.
At my door sat an elderly woman.
"What is his name?"
the woman asked the orderly who had been wheeling me.
"What's your name?"
the orderly repeated to me.
"Harold Krents," I replied.
"Harold Krents," he repeated.
"When was he born?"
"When were you born?"
"November 5, 1," I responded.
"November 5, 1," the orderly intoned.
This procedure continued for approximately five minutes.
"Look," I finally blurted out, "This is ridiculous.
I can't see, but it's got to have become pretty clear to both of you that I don't need an interpreter.
Lady, you could have just talked to me directly."
"He says you could have just talked to him directly," the orderly reported to the woman.
The toughest misconception of all is the view that because I can't see, I can't work.
I was turned down by over forty law firms because of my blindness, even though I had a Harvard Law degree.
To my delight, this view of limitation and exclusion is beginning to change.
On April 1, 1, the Department of Labor issued regulations that mandate equal-employment opportunities for the handicapped.
I look forward to the day when employers view their handicapped workers as a little child did me years ago.
At that time, I was playing basketball with my father in our backyard.
My father would stand beneath the hoop, shout, and I would shoot over his head at the basket attached to our garage.
Our next-door neighbor, aged five, wandered over into our yard with a playmate.
"He's blind," our neighbor whispered to her friend.
Dad shot and missed; I did the same.
"Which one is blind?"
whispered back the little friend.
I hope that in the future, when a plant manager comes upon a handicapped and a nonhandicapped person working together, his comment after watching them work will be, "Which one is disabled?"
