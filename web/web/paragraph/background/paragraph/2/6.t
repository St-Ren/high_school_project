Lesson Six   Emily Dickinson and Her Poems.
Many great writers were active people who had strange experiences, traveled widely, and knew a lot of people.
Do you think a woman who just stayed home, hardly ever saw anyone, and only published seven poems during her lifetime could be a great poet?
Well, Emily Dickinson was.
In fact, she is considered one of the greatest American poets of the nineteenth century.
She was a rather unusual person.
She seldom left her house, she never married, and she always dressed in white.
But she wrote wonderful poems about nature, love, life, and death.
Her poems are short and not hard to read, but they have deep meanings.
See if you can figure out the meanings of the poems that follow.
If I Can Stop One Heart from Breaking
If I can stop one heart from breaking,
I shall not live in vain;
If I can ease one life the aching,
Or cool one pain,
Or help one fainting robin
Unto his nest again,
I shall not live in vain.
Im Nobody!
Who Are You?
Im nobody!
Who are you?
Are you nobody too?
Then theres a pair of us?
Dont tell!
Theyd advertise, you know!
How dreary to be somebody!
How publicXlike a frogX
To tell ones name the livelong June
To an admiring bog!
Hope Is the Thing with Feathers
Hope is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all.
And sweetest in the gale is heard;
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little bird
That kept so many warm.
Ive heard it in the chilliest land,
And on the strangest sea;
Yet, never, in extremity,
It asked a crumb of me.
