The Greenhouse Effect and the Women of Guatemala.
Most people know something about the greenhouse effect.
Animals and people breathe out the gas carbon dioxide, or CO, and factories send much more of it into the atmosphere.
In the past, this wasnt a problem because plants, especially trees, absorbed the CO.
But now, with more trees being cut down and factories releasing more and more CO, this greenhouse gas is accumulating in the upper atmosphere.
This results in the steadily rising temperature of air and water near and on the Earths surface.
To prevent this problem from getting worse, we need to stop burning coal, oil, and other carbon-based fuels.
Renewable energy from the sun and wind is a much better option.
But the simplest solution is to plant more trees, since one tree can absorb ten pounds of carbon dioxide every year.
In the past the mountains of Guatemala, in Central America, were thick and green with beautiful trees.
But people cut down the trees for houses and firewood.
As a result of this deforestation, the rain now washes good soil down the mountains, and women must walk for miles to get firewood.
Far away from Guatemala, in the state of Connecticut, there is a factory.
Because this factory uses coal, it sends 400,000 tons of CO into the atmosphere every year.
But the factory owners are doing something about it.
They are giving two million dollars to the women of Guatemala so that the women will plant trees in their country.
These trees in Central America will absorb the carbon dioxide from the factory in Connecticut.
Why plant trees in Guatemala instead of in Connecticut?
The answer is simple.
Trees grow much faster in Central America than in the northern part of the United States.
More trees will be good not only for the Earths atmosphere but also for Guatemala.
In small villages in Guatemala, most women are poor and lead hard lives.
Planting trees will help them in three ways.
First, the Connecticut factory will pay them to plant the trees not with money but with corn which means more food for their children.
Second, these women have a wealth of knowledge about their environment with regard to where to plant, when to plant, and what kinds of trees to plant.
For example, they can plant many fruit trees, which add vitamins to their diets.
They can plant other trees for firewood, and in a few years the women wont have to spend so much time walking to get wood.
Third, all these new trees will be good for the soil.
The rain wont be able to wash the soil down the mountains so easily.
This plan wont be enough to stop the greenhouse effect, which is a problem for the whole world, but its a beginning.
And the women of Guatemala will be helping themselves as well as their environment.
As one woman says, Were planting for our families, for our children.
