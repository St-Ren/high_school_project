Is Your Diet Destroying the Environment?
A vegetarian diet is often praised for its health benefits.
Vegetarians usually have lower levels of heart disease, and studies have shown that they have a lower risk of diabetes than people who eat meat.
What most people are less aware of, however, are the effects that a vegetarian diet, compared to a non-vegetarian diet, can have on the environment.
Researchers from the Union of Concerned Scientists in the U.S. recently studied how consumer behavior affects the environment.
The study showed that meat consumption is one of the main ways that humans can damage the environment, second only to the use of motor vehicles.
So how can eating meat have a negative effect on the environment?
For a start, all livestock animals, such as cows, pigs, and sheep, release methane gas by expelling wind from their bodies.
One cow can produce up to sixty liters of methane each day.
Methane gas is the second most common greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide.
Many environmental experts now believe that methane is more responsible for global warming than carbon dioxide.
It is estimated that 25 percent of all methane released into the atmosphere comes from farm animals.
Another way in which meat production affects the environment is through the use of water and land.
Twenty-five hundred gallons of water are needed to produce one pound of beef, whereas twenty gallons of water are needed to produce one pound of wheat.
One acre of farmland used for raising livestock can produce 250 pounds of beef.
One acre of farmland used for crop production can produce 40,000 pounds of potatoes, 30,000 pounds of carrots, or 50,000 pounds of tomatoes.
Many people now see the benefits of switching to a vegetarian diet, not just for health reasons, but also for the vital role it plays in protecting the environment.
However, some nutritionists advise against switching to a totally strict vegetarian, or vegan, diet.
They believe a vegan diet, which excludes all products from animal sources, including cheese, eggs, and milk, can be deficient in many of the necessary vitamins and minerals our bodies need.
Today, many people know that it is important to take better care of their bodies, and to use the earth's resources more efficiently.
As this understanding spreads, more and more people may realize that to help the environment, and for the human race to survive, they will need to become vegetarian.
