Suppose you were enrolled at a foreign university, and one night you dreamed that you were floating above a table in a spacious room, moving further and further away from it.
All of a sudden, you were sitting at the table with many people, all of whom were strangers.
The table was covered with books instead of plates, but you couldn't open any of them when you tried to.
No sooner had this happened than, out of nowhere, a dog came running in and started barking.
Suddenly, you saw that it was not a dog but your father and that the guests were your friends and family members, who were laughing.
How would you look at this complicated, seemingly self-contradictory dream?
According to Sigmund Freud, dreams are more than a collection of meaningless or ridiculous events or images; they may in fact represent emotions and desires deep in your mind.
Freud was a renowned psychiatrist in Vienna, Austria, in the early 2th century.
He treated patients with psychological problems by simply letting them talk to him about anything that was bothering them.
In this way, he began to realize that many patients had forgotten certain, perhaps painful, events which could still affect their feelings and actions.
Freud thought these "repressed" memories or thoughts were hidden in the unconscious mind.
They were altered or disguised when they appeared in our actual dreams at night so that we could continue to sleep without being disturbed.
Otherwise, when confronted by these memories or thoughts, we would become distressed and soon wake up.
Thus, dreams fundamentally act as the guardians of sleep.
Freud set forth this theory of dreams in his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams, which was first published in 1.
How are our memories and ideas actually transformed in our dreams?
Freud, in his book, mentions a few very important mechanisms.
One of them is condensation, by which two or more unrelated, or even contradictory, dream-thoughts are combined to form one single element.
Take the dream in the first paragraph for example.
The scene of yourself floating above the table may be a combination, or condensation, of your anxiety about going far away from home and your sense of new-found freedom and power.
The two different scenes of sitting at the table could be explained as a condensation of opposite feelings about your friends and family: they might become strangers to you when you go away, but on the other hand they will still be very close to you.
Another mechanism is displacement, in which a troubling thought is replaced by a symbol.
This removes the emotional significance of the thought so that the dreamer does not become suspicious.
For example, the barking dog in the above-mentioned dream may actually be your father.
The most obvious meaning is that you worry how angry your father will be if you do not succeed in your studies.
In addition, the food that we would normally expect to be on a dining table was displaced by books.
This perhaps suggests that the latter are almost as important as food to the dreamer.
Does Freud's theory of dream interpretation make sense to you?
Perhaps you may try to take a closer look at some of your dreams in order to attain a deeper understanding of yourself and your hidden or "unconscious" feelings.
As the poet Pope said, "The proper study of mankind is man," but perhaps man is also his own greatest mystery.
