Unit 3  The Tao: People of the Sea.
Surrounded by water on all sides and rich in marine resources, Taiwan is closely connected with the ocean.
In addition to the fact that seafood plays an important part in our daily diet, we also rely on sea transportation for trading.
However, few of us value our ties with the ocean as much as the Tao do.
The Tao are the indigenous people who inhabit Orchid Island.
Among all the tribes of Taiwan, the Tao may be the only one that is genuinely in great awe of the ocean.
The reason why the ocean is of such great significance to the Tao people lies in the geographical environment of Orchid Island.
The land being very rugged and infertile, the Tao people can only plant some crops that are easy to grow, such as taros and yams, as their staple crops.
To maintain an adequate intake of protein, they must paddle off to sea to catch fish.
Over the years, the Tao have developed a philosophy of fishing, which is intended for both bountiful catches and the conservation of marine life.
For example, they are used to catching fish with their bare hands, and they respectfully follow their fishing calendar which corresponds to the movements of ocean currents.
Every year from March to June, the waters around Orchid Island are frequented by schools of flying fish brought by the Kuroshio Current.
This period of time, also known as the flying fish season, has become the principal fishing season for the Tao.
The Tao people regard flying fish as a gift from their god, so the occasion of catching flying fish has been highly valued.
Traditionally, during the flying fish season, tribesmen from different families have to form fishing groups and live together, following numerous rules about diet and living.
Before the fishing groups set sail to fish, the members utilize their exceptional wood-carving skills to build plank boats.
In order to ward off evil spirits and pray for blessings, they paint certain totems on their boats, including shapes of humans, waves, and concentric circles.
These elaborately decorated boats are sacred to the Tao people and are their most precious cultural heritage.
Furthermore, the Tao people hold many different ceremonies throughout the entire flying fish season to show their gratitude to their god and to ensure a good catch.
Their traditional music and dances also reveal strong imagery of the ocean.
Clearly, the Tao have created a unique, ocean-oriented culture.
As technology has advanced, the lifestyle of the Tao has changed to some degree.
The plank boats that they used to sail are now being replaced with engine-powered rafts.
The development of the local tourist industry is also presenting a threat to the local environment, not to mention the thousands of tons of nuclear waste stored on this island.
Nevertheless, many of the Tao people still endeavor to preserve both their living environment and their culture.
Without a writing system, these people pass on their wisdom via narration.
Hopefully, flying fish will continue riding the ocean waves to Orchid Island, and the Taos god will keep on looking after these people of the sea.
