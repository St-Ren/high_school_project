Unit 8  A Memorable Event.
Charlie Chaplin was a prominent comedian who starred in many silent movies.
The following story tells us something important that happened to him and his mother in his childhood.
I was born in London on April 16, 1889.
According to Mother, my world was a happy one.
Our circumstances were moderately comfortable; we rented an apartment with three tastefully furnished rooms.
One of my early memories was that each night before Mother went to work, she would tenderly tuck me in.
My lovely mother was a singer.
Unfortunately, in her late twenties, she suffered from laryngitis, but she was obliged to keep working in order to support our family.
Because of this condition, my mothers voice would crack or suddenly faded out in the middle of the performance.
The audience would laugh and start booing.
As her voice grew progressively worse, she could no longer rely on it.
It was owing to her voice condition that I made my debut on the stage at the age of five.
If my mother hadnt had laryngitis, I wouldnt have begun my performing career at such an early age.
One night, in preference to leaving me alone at home, Mother took me to the dirty, mean theater she worked at.
It catered mostly to soldiers who needed no excuse to mock and ridicule whoever was performing onstage.
Theres no denying that for most performers, that theater was a place of terror.
I remembered standing in the wings when Mothers voice cracked and went into a whisper again.
The audience began to laugh and make fun of her.
The whole thing was vague to me, and I did not quite understand what was going on.
It was not until Mother stepped off the stage that the noise stopped.
When she came backstage, she was very upset.
The stage manager, who had seen me perform before, suggested that I go on in place of Mother.
In chaos, he took me by the hand and led me onto the stage.
After a few words of explanation to the audience, the manager left me on the stage alone.
Then, accompanied by the orchestra, I started to sing.
Halfway through my performance, a shower of money poured onto the stage.
Immediately, I paused and announced that I would pick up the money first and sing afterward.
This caused much laughter.
The stage manager came out and helped me gather up the money.
Fearing that he was going to keep the money, I conveyed this thought to the audience.
This made them explode with laughter, especially when the manager walked off with the moneyXwith me anxiously following him.
Not until he handed all the money to Mother did I return to the stage and continue singing.
After I felt more at home onstage, I began to talk to the audience, dance, and do several imitations.
I even imitated Mothers voice cracking.
The audiences reaction surprised me.
There was laughter and cheers followed by more money thrown onto the stage.
When Mother came on the stage to carry me off, her presence drew deafening applause.
That night was my first appearance on the stage, and Mothers last.
