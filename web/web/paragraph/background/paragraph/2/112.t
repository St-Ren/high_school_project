Unit 7 The Taj Mahal: A Teardrop of Love.
There are a million ways to express deep affection for our loved ones.
To Shah Jahan, an emperor in ancient India, building an incomparable tomb was how he memorialized his love.
Finished more than three hundred years ago, this tomb remains one of the most impressive and glorious wonders of the world to date.
It is known as the Taj Mahal.
In fact, behind this grand structure is a touching story.
Legend has it that Shah Jahan had numerous wives.
Among them, Mumtaz Mahal was his favorite.
He felt extremely depressed after she passed away while giving birth.
Therefore, he recruited twenty-thousand workers to construct a luxurious tomb by the river Yamuna in memory of her.
Building materials and valuable treasures were brought in from every part of the world.
The emperor was particular about every detail, so it took twenty-two years to complete the construction.
Before long, however, the emperor was usurped by his own son and imprisoned in the Agra Fort on the other bank of Yamuna.
From across the river, he gazed day and night at this masterpiece built for the love of his life until his death.
Though centuries passed, the Taj Mahal still stands there today, receiving admiration from people around the world.
Such is its beauty that almost everyone is fascinated by it, including world-famous literary masters.
Tagore called it a teardrop of love upon the cheek of time and wrote the following words in praise of its lasting beauty: Though empires crumble to dust, and centuries are lost in shadows, the marble still sighs to the stars. As Salman Rushdie stood amid the crowds of people admiring this great construction, he admitted his incapability of describing it.
To him, the Taj Mahal is a lovely thing, perhaps the loveliest of things.
Observed from the back or from the side, the Taj Mahal is perfect.
The magic lies in its white marble dome, which reflects the sunlight and the moonlight.
Its color, as a result, changes at different times of a day.
Bathed in the light of the setting sun, it carries a glimmer of gold.
In the moonlight, it shines brightly when the precious stones reflect the moonlight spilling upon the terrace.
When the sun rises the next morning, a pink flush appears instead.
Its countenance is also reflected in the water mirror that sits right in front of it, with sunlight and clouds adoring it each day.
Another architectural achievement of the Taj Mahal is its remarkable feminine lines.
Most great architectural structures in the world inspire awe with a certain masculine qualityXaggressiveness, arrogance, or pomposity.
In contrast, the gentle yet rich and full contoursXwhite, elegant, and tender make the Taj Mahal one of the very few exceptions.
Aside from this, no other famous building on earth might be as accessible as it.
There is no need to make a difficult journey to see it.
With no mountains to scale and no rivers to cross, tourists can experience the Taj Mahal without any difficulty.
As one of the most amazing wonders in the world, the Taj Mahal is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the years, it has sat in Agra and symbolized the emperors undying passion for his wife.
In the future, this story will still touch peoples hearts, and the beauty of the Taj Mahal will always stick in their minds.
