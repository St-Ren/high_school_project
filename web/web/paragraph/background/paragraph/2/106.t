Unit 12  The Road Not Taken.
Robert Frost was one of the greatest American poets of the 20th century.
He is the only poet to have won four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry.
According to John F. Kennedy, He has bequeathed his nation a body of imperishable verse from which Americans will forever gain joy and understanding. Frosts poems express a sense of common humanity and have appealed to generations of readers.
His poems are mostly descriptions of rural life and everyday events that explore deep aspects of human experience.
The Road Not Taken is a prime example of this.
The Road Not Taken
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
The Road Not Taken was written during Frosts stay in England, when he used to take walks with his friend who liked to choose routes at random.
Yet, afterward, Frosts friend would always complain that they could have enjoyed even more gorgeous scenery if it had not been for his previous choice.
Frost was thus inspired to write this poem, which captures the dilemma of human decision-making.
In this poem, the narrator was a traveler who needed to choose which route to take in the woods.
In the end, he selected the superficially less trodden one.
Since there was little possibility of going back for the other one, he could not help but imagine himself telling his choice-making tale with a sigh many years later.
The narrators inner conflict, therefore, makes choosing a road in the countryside a symbol of making a decision in life.
Frosts sensitive poetic narrative may arouse great empathy in many of us when we recall the past decision-making experiences in our lives.
When in distress, we tend to look back on the moments when we needed to make important choices.
In effect, once we make a choice, we have to let go of all the other alternatives.
Every choice will lead us to a different series of other choices, and it is impossible to reverse the situation.
The poem can also be an inspiration for those who need to make important decisions about their futures.
For example, a student might stand at a crossroads, such as choosing which subject to major in or which college to attend.
Later in life, there will be career paths to choose as well.
Whatever problems we are confronted with and whatever our choices are, it will, at any rate, be no use regretting any choice that has been made.
The final choice is ours, and ours alone.
