Chiufen: A Cultural Treasure of Taiwan
The town of Chiufen, located on a mountainside overlooking the Pacific Ocean, is regarded as one of Taiwans unique cultural treasures.
A visit here offers a chance to escape from the roaring traffic and daily bustle of city life, and a chance to let the imagination wander back in time.
Old brick buildings, packed intimately together, one row built just above the other, offer a charming, relaxed view.
Narrow, dark alleyways, paved in stone that is now worn down by the foot and carriage traffic of many decades, suggest an old-fashioned way of life.
The whole place has a picturesque and romantic air about it.
Just as picturesque and romantic as the scenery of Chiufen is the story behind it.
In the past century, the town has undergone several dramatic changes.
Beginning as a tiny, unknown village, it grew into a booming gold mining town, then later became a peaceful artists colony, and finally one of the major tourist attractions in northern Taiwan.
Indeed, it is this fascinating past that has made the town so popular today.
Chiufen started out as a remote mountain community with only nine families.
In fact, it is from these nine families that Chiufen derives its name, which in English means nine portions. Because the village was almost impossible to get to by road, whenever anyone made the long trip to town for provisions, they would always bring back nine portions of each item, one for each family.
This simple way of life changed almost overnight in the 1890s, when gold was discovered in Chiufen.
Hoping to get rich quick, people flocked to the town, which came to be known as the gold capital of Asia. By the 1930s, the town had grown to between 3,000 and 4,000 homes.
The tiny streets were now lined with homes and many different kinds of stores and restaurants.
The city even boasted the first theater in all of northern Taiwan.
Before long, sleepy Chiufen had become what people called Little Shanghai.
For many people, however, life in Chiufen was not easy.
Many of them had very dirty and dangerous jobs in the dark gold mines.
Nevertheless, the relatively good wagesXand the thought of finding their own goldXkept miners at the job.
Whats more, their free-spending ways enabled Chiufen to continue to prosper.
Within just a few decades, however, this way of life disappeared.
By the 1960s, the gold was nearly gone; eventually, the mines were abandoned, people moved away, and Chiufen was almost forgotten.
But not completelyXas far as some people were concerned, especially artists and poets, the town remained as attractive as ever.
Its peaceful seaside location and beautiful scenery, complete with springtime cherry blossoms, cool summer breezes, swaying autumn grasses, and romantic winter rains, were ideal for anyone in search of inspiration.
When painters began holding exhibitions around the island that showed the landscape of Chiufen, more people began to take notice, and when some filmmakers began to make movies in Chiufen, the towns fame continued to grow.
Today, Chiufen is once again enjoying a new life, this time as a tourist destination.
Visitors can now relax in one of the many teahouses that are hidden in the alleyways, stroll along Chishan Street and sample the taro balls and other local snacks, or spend a quiet evening at an old-style inn, watching the sun set over the mountains.
Perhaps most of all, they can get a feeling of what the town was like nearly a century ago.
Chiufen may no longer be rich in gold, but it is still rich in history.
