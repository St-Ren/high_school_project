Unit 8  Always Open, Always Convenient.
Convenience stores are definitely a common sight in Taiwan.
In Taiwans bustling cities, it is not surprising at all to see two convenience stores on one block.
Even in the quiet suburbs, there always seems to be at least one convenience store open for business.
Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then, that Taiwan has the highest density of convenience stores in the world.
Another common sight in Taiwan is that convenience stores are more often than not crowded with people, especially at mealtimes.
Some people, for instance, never start their day without first stopping at a convenience store for a cup of coffee.
Clearly, convenience stores have become very successful by weaving themselves into the fabric of everyday life in Taiwan.
One important reason for the popularity of convenience stores in Taiwan is the wide variety of services that they offer.
These services allow people to save time when they run errands, since they can take care of their daily needs in one convenient place.
In addition to buying different types of food and drinks, people can pay their phone bills, parking fees, and even traffic fines.
Whats more, they can withdraw money from an ATM in these stores as well.
With a hand pay-on-pickup service, people can shop on the Internet and then collect what they have purchased at a convenience store nearby.
Also, people are able to pre-order many different items, ranging from local cuisine to concert tickets.
Best of all, all of these services are available at all times because convenience stores are open twenty-four hours a day.
Without a doubt, the services that convenience stores offer have changed peoples shopping habits.
In fact, there are several clever marketing strategies behind these services.
First, the marketing experts of most convenience-store chains understand that the more often people go to their stores, the more likely they are to buy something.
Offering many services, according to these marketing experts, creates more opportunities for convenience stores to attract customers.
As a result, whatever customers purposes may be when they walk into a store, they will probably end up buying something.
For example, a freelance designer might stop by a convenience store to make some copies and then get a sandwich before walking up to the counter.
Second, people get the impression from advertisements that convenience stores can take care of their daily needs.
Many people, thus, tend to consider convenience stores reliable, particularly because these stores provide various kinds of supplies.
Whatever people may need, convenience stores have these items stacked on their shelves already.
Finally, convenience stores combine regular services with special sales promotions once in a while.
Because of this, some people are tempted and motivated to pop into convenience stores and purchase more products.
These strategies stimulate consumption and have become essential ingredients of the huge success of convenience stores in Taiwan.
Apparently, the ever-growing convenience-store industry in Taiwan has been built upon a win-win arrangement for both the stores and their customers.
Convenience stores help people get what they want and save their precious time.
In return, these customers usually purchase more products from these stores, and these stores, consequently, earn more profits.
This mutually beneficial relationship certainly goes a long way toward explaining why convenience stores in Taiwan are always open and always convenient.
