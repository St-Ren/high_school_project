Mona Lisa and Da Vinci.
You have certainly seen the Mona Lisa before.
A woman with a slight smile on her face, her hands crossed over her stomach, sits in front of a strange and beautiful landscape looking straight at you.
This little painting on wood, by Leonardo da Vinci, is the most famous piece of art in the world.
One reason for this is its great mystery.
No one knows for sure who Mona Lisa really was.
Da Vinci kept a diary of all his other portrait sittings, but he never wrote down who posed for the Mona Lisa.
Some people believe that a Florentine lady whom da Vinci knew was the model, but there is no definite proof of this.
Some people believe that the model was a young boy dressed as a woman.
But perhaps the most interesting theory is that the painting is a self-portrait.
Some people say that there is a strong resemblance between the eyes, nose, and mouth of Leonardo da Vincis self-portraits and the Mona Lisas face.
Da Vinci himself lived a very mysterious life.
There are many legends about him, some of which are very different from the others.
In some descriptions he is an athlete, but other people thought of him as a quiet dreamer.
However, he did keep very detailed notebooks describing his many insights and inventions.
Da Vinci wrote his notebooks backwards, so that they can only be read in a mirror.
From these amazing diaries we know that he was a genius at many things.
He was mainly known during his life as an engineer, and in fact his notebooks are full of brilliant inventionsXweapons, bridges, buildings, ways to move water, flying machines, and many other things that no one had ever thought of or built before.
He also drew human beings perfectly, and studied the science of animals and plants.
But it is not just because the artist was so interesting that the Mona Lisa in particular has become the symbol of fine art throughout the world.
Why is the Mona Lisa so exciting and captivating?
What is it about this picture that makes it impossible to look away?
The face of a human being is the most expressive and enchanting thing we can look at.
Looking at other people, we can recognize all of our own feelings and thoughts in their eyes and the shapes of their mouths.
When we look into anothers eyes, we understand and feel much more than when we look at fruit or flowers.
And the Mona Lisa is even more alive than many other paintings of the human face.
The Mona Lisa is painted in a very special way, so that looking at her is just like looking at a real person.
This is not because she is painted perfectly realistically, like a photographXshes not.
The corners of her eyes and mouth, all of the lines and colors in her skin, are soft and blurred.
This makes her seem to be moving, like a person who is breathing and whose heart is beating.
Every time you look at the Mona Lisa, she seems to have changed a little.
Every person who looks at her sees something different.
Some people see sadness in her smile, others see mischief, and some people think she is laughing at them.
But looking at Mona Lisas mysterious smile, many people feel that she knows a secret, and she intends to keep it forever.
