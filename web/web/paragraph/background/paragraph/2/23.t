Whos Out There?
Do you believe there is life in outer space?
A recent poll asked 900 American adults this question.
Sixty percent answered yes.
Over 40 percent of college graduates believed that flying saucers had visited the Earth.
Close to 50 percent thought aliens were more intelligent than people on Earth.
Eighty-five percent also said they thought aliens were friendly rather than hostile.
Many people are convinced that aliens visit us regularly.
They say that the American government knows this but is covering it up.
In the last few years, thousands of Americans say they have been abducted by aliens.
In fact, there is so much common knowledge about aliens that people can even describe what they look like: tall and slender, with huge heads and almond-shaped eyes.
There are models of aliens in the UFO (unidentified flying object) Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico.
Roswell, New Mexico, is where it all started, over fifty years ago.
In 1947, a farmer in the area found some strange, shiny material on the ground.
He gave it to the sheriff, who turned it over to the army.
The army sent out a press release about a flying disk. The local newspaper made a slight change and wrote a story about a flying saucer in the Roswell region.
The next day, the army changed the story and said that the material was from a weather balloon.
Everyone forgot about the incident for many years.
Not until the 1980s was the Roswell incident mentioned again when several stories were published.
Some people said that a spaceship had crashed on some farmland and that three to five alien bodies had been found.
The bodies were being kept by the government in a secret place.
The government denied the story, but many people still believed it was true.
Seventy-one percent of the people polled said they believed the government knew more than they were telling people.
People would panic if they knew what really happened, said an observer.
Now Roswell has become a meeting place for people who believe in aliens.
On the fiftieth anniversary of the rumors of a spaceship landing, more than 100,000 people gathered in the desert town, where the temperature can reach 110 degrees.
They went out in the hot sun to look for the burn mark the spaceship left when it crashed against a rock.
They paid $15 each for a viewing.
No one complained when they didnt see a spaceship.
They were just happy to be there.
Why all the interest in aliens?
People are worried about problems on Earth and are suspicious of new technologies.
Perhaps this leads them to believe there are beings who are more intelligent than we are.
They hope these beings will save us and teach us better ways to live.
Of course, a lot of people are making money on these beliefs.
Motel owners in Roswell say a quarter of their visitors come to see the alien landing site.
Stores in Roswell sell everything from stuffed alien dolls to alien refrigerator magnets.
The media play up the belief as well.
Alien-based movies and television shows feature government cover-ups and alien invasions.
And the fourth most popular talk show in America is about UFOs and aliens.
Skeptics say this is all a myth.
People want to believe we are not alone in the universe, but no facts prove there is life anywhere else.
Others disagree.
We just dont know if aliens exist, says a researcher.
But technology changes so quickly.
Years ago people would never believe some of the things we can do today.
Who knows whats out there?
We have to keep looking.
