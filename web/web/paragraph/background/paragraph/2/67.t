Mistakes That Worked: Post-it Notes and Slinky.
Call them accidents.
Call them mistakes.
If the truth were known, we might be amazed by the number of great inventions and discoveries that were accidental, unplanned and unintentional.
Post-it Notes
By now everyone knows what Post-it Notes are.
They are those great little self-stick notepapers.
Most people have Post-it Notes.
Most people use them.
Most people love them.
But Post-it Notes were not a planned product.
No one got the idea and then stayed up nights to invent it.
A man named Spencer Silver was working in the 3M research laboratories in 1970 trying to find a strong adhesive.
Silver developed a new adhesive, but it was even weaker than those 3M already manufactured.
It stuck to objects, but could easily be lifted off.
It should have been super-strong, but it turned out to be super-weak instead.
No one knew what to do with the stuff, but Silver didn't discard it.
Then one Sunday four years later, another 3M scientist named Arthur Fry was singing in his church's choir.
He used markers to keep his place in the hymnal, but they kept falling out of the book.
Remembering Silver's adhesive, Fry used some to coat his markers.
With the weak adhesive, the markers stayed in place, yet lifted off without damaging the pages.
In 1980, ten years after Silver developed the super-weak adhesive, 3M began distributing Post-it Notes nationwide.
Today they are one of the most popular office products available.
In 1943, during World War II, an engineer in the United States Navy was on a new ship's trial run.
As he worked, a torsion spring suddenly fell to the floor.
The spring flip-flopped as the ingenious man watched.
The naval engineer's name was Richard James, and when he returned home, he remembered the spring and the interesting way it flip-flopped.
James and his wife Betty perfected a long steel ribbon tightly coiled into a spiral.
They began production in 1945.
The no-battery-required toy has fascinated three generations of children and adults alike.
According to one estimate, more than two million Slinkys have been sold and the only change in the original design has been to crimp the ends as a safety measure.
Betty James died in November 2008, aged 90, after having served as president of James Industries from 1960 to 1998.
But the Slinky is still hopping, skipping, jumping, and bouncing across floors and down stairs all over America.
It is easy to fail and then abandon the whole idea.
It's more difficult to fail and then recognize another use for the failure.
As stated best by Bertolt Brecht in 1930, intelligence is not to make no mistakes, but to quickly see how to make them good.
