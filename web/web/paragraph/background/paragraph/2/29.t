The House with Golden Windows.
Two children living happily in their fathers house would often look in the evening to another house standing on a distant hilltop.
The evening sun painted it with glory as its rays were reflected from many windowpanes.
One afternoon the children started out to visit the house of the golden windows.
They struggled over fields and through bush and woodland until at last the moment arrived.
They stood before the enchanted house of their dreams and their hopes.
But alas!
They found it deserted and bleak.
Many years worth of dust and slime had covered the panes of glass, which gave forth no golden splendor.
The house was lonely, cold, forsaken.
Disappointed, discouraged, and afraid, they turned to go.
As they did so their eyes fell on their own home in the distance, bathed in the golden splendor of the setting sun.
They saw this and more than this.
Their sad experience had taught them to realize the inner light, not the reflected light, which shines in every home worthy of the name and makes it one of the brightest and dearest spots on earthXa refuge, a joy, a hope, and forever a happiness.
It was under the spell of the light reflected from their own windows that the children caught the full vision of the inner and true light and glory of home.
And they both cried out, See our house; our own home is the true house of the golden windows!
