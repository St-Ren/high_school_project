To forgive is divine, according to Alexander Pope, but it is hardly easy.
How do you forgive a driver that runs into someone and then drives away, a bully who makes your life miserable, or a cheating boyfriend or girlfriend?
You might have had thoughts like, I can never forgive him for what he did to me. All of us are challenged to forgive on a regular basis.
Most of us know we should forgive, but studies show that forgiveness  is important for more than just moral reasons.
It can also improve our physical and emotional health.
Why Should I Forgive?
Studies show that forgiveness reduces anger, nervousness, and stress.
It also leads to feelings of hope, compassion, and self-confidence.

Refusing to forgive, on the other hand, is not healthy.
It can increase your risk of developing heart diseases, high blood pressure, and depression.
What Is True Forgiveness?
Forgiveness is letting go of feelings of hurt or anger.
Forgiveness does not necessarily mean forgetting.
If a friend reveals your secrets to someone else, forgive him and tell yourself: He is a good friend in other ways, but keeping secrets is currently not one of his attributes.
Why Is It So Hard to Forgive?
Most people believe they should forgive, but find it difficult.
One of the most common reasons is that people dont want to let the offender off the hook.
What they want is justice.
However, not forgiving hurts you far more than it hurts the offender.
People often think forgiveness means they should act as if no wrongdoing has ever happened.
But this is not right.
If someone has broken your trust, it may be wise not to trust him or her again.
