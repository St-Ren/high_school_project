Learning to Keep Your Cool.
Have you ever panicked or blanked out during a test?
Most students experience some level of anxiety not only during a test, but also before a test.
Some experience mainly physical symptoms, such as headaches, upset stomach, nausea, restlessness, and sleep problems.
Others experience more emotional symptoms, like crying easily, feeling irritable, or getting frustrated quickly.
They are suffering from what is called test anxiety.
In fact, a little bit of stress is helpful.
It makes students feel keyed up and helps them to perform better.
However, test anxiety can make it difficult to concentrate because students may not have had enough sleep.
Thus, such anxiety may increase the likelihood of forgetting and making careless errors on an exam.
This anxiety can also affect exam performance by making it hard for students to prepare well for a test.
Poor preparation may result from any of the following:
poor time management
failure to organize course information
poor study habits
If you suffer from test anxiety, you should know that there are ways to overcome it.
Before a test, try to build up your confidence.
View the test as an opportunity to show how much youve studied.
Digest and organize the material thoroughly.
Allow yourself plenty of time and avoid thinking you need to cram just before the big test.
In addition, getting a good nights sleep can sharpen the mind.
During the test, read the directions carefully and budget your test-taking time.
If you go blank, skip that question and go on.
When other students start handing in their papers, dont panic.
Theres no reward for being the first one done.
If you find yourself tensing up and getting anxious, try to relax.
Otherwise, you might not even be able to put down the answers you actually know.
Try stretching as hard as you can.
Tense the muscles in your arms and legs; then suddenly relax all of them.
This will help relieve tension.
But keep in mind that you dont want to be too relaxed.
Being totally relaxed is no better than being too tense.
If you are so calm that you dont care how you do on a test, you wont do well.
Expect some anxiety.
Its a reminder that you want to do your best, and it gives you more energy and helps you to concentrate.
Just keep your anxiety at a level that is manageable.
Realize that anxiety can actually be a habit and that it takes practice to use it as a means to succeed.
Once you start the test, stop worrying.
Do your best.
Above all, dont forget to celebrate after the test.
Be happy that you have overcome a big obstacle!
