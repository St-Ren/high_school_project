By the time the birds are singing and the sun comes up, many people are already enjoying a cup of coffee.
Drinking a cup of coffee is a morning ritual millions of people all over the world share.
Because people want coffee so much, it has become an important commodity, second only to petroleum in dollars traded.
Here are some facts everyone should know about one of the world's most popular beverages.
A rich history
The magic of the coffee plant was discovered around 900 AD  by a shepherd in a place called Kaffa.
He noticed his sheep became active after eating a certain kind of berry.
He tried some himself and experienced a similar effect.
Although this may not be the true story, it is probably quite close.
Historians believe the word "coffee" does, in fact, go back to Kaffa.
Around 1000 AD, Arab traders took coffee home to Yemen.
They tried boiling the beans, inventing a drink they called "wine that keeps you awake."
The Arab world began expanding its trade horizons, and the coffee beans moved into northern Africa and were cultivated.
From there, the beans entered the Indian and European markets, and the coffee culture started to spread to the rest of the world.
Compassionate coffee
Because of the effort needed to brew that perfect cup, selling hot coffee has always been good business.
That's why coffee is a major 7cash crop in South America.
However, while new farming methods have made growing coffee more efficient than before, these new methods are hurting the environment.
In the past, coffee was grown under a covering of trees which not only protected the coffee, but also provided birds
with a winter home.
With growing demand for coffee, new coffee plants were introduced to increase the amount of harvest.
However, for these plants to get enough light from the sun, forests have been cut down.
As a result, the birds have lost their winter homes.
Furthermore, with the trees cut down, soil erosion and need of pesticides increased.
It became obvious that
sun-grown coffee was causing an environmental disaster.
Gradually, people are becoming aware of the benefits offered by shade-grown coffee.
The roots of the shade trees help keep the soil in place, so the erosion problem is taken care of.
Since the shade-grown plants need fewer pesticides, the environment isn't damaged by them.
Moreover, a single farm with shade-grown coffee can act as a special place for birds.
In fact, companies that sell coffee, including Starbucks, are beginning to offer shade-grown coffee.
So spend a bit more and make your next cup of coffee a caring one-the earth and birds will thank you.
