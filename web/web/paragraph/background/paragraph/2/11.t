Lesson Eleven   Les Mis?rables.
Victor Hugos novel Les Mis?rables captures peoples imaginations.
This story of poverty, revolution, and romance strikes a chord in the hearts of people everywhere.
But people no longer have to read the book to enjoy the story.
Adapted from the 1,200-page novel, Les Mis?rables, or Les Miz as the musical version is often called, captures hearts in the theater.
The story begins in 1815, when Jean Valjean leaves prison.
Though he tries, Valjean can get no work because of his criminal past.
He finally steals some valuable silver from a kind bishop.
The police catch him and return him to the bishops house.
To Valjeans surprise, the bishop tells the police he gave Valjean the silver as a present.
After the police leave, the bishop tells Valjean that he must use the silver to become an honest man.
As the story continues, Valjean does his best to be an honest man.
He vows to raise a dying mothers little girl as his own.
He helps a group of students and the Paris poor as they fight against injustice.
He saves the man his daughter loves.
All the while, a policeman is pursuing him because he broke his parole.
The lyricist calls the emotional story a powerful river carrying you from beginning to end.
Les Miz began as a French production.
When the producer Cameron Mackintosh heard a recording of it in 1980, he immediately wanted to bring it to London.
However, he realized that the musical needed to be reworked.
The French people know the story of Jean Valjean so well that the French musical began in the middle of the story.
An English audience would need more background.
Mackintosh, the directors, and the writers worked to translate the existing songs into English.
They also added new ones to give the audience a clearer idea of the whole story.
After reworking the musical, Mackintosh and the directors got the cast together in April 1985.
They asked the actors and actresses to learn about the Paris of Victor Hugo.
Everyone had to research something: church, schooling, police, medical services, etc.
This background really helped the cast understand the characters they were playing.
The show opened on October 8, 1985, in London.
The critics didnt like it, but the audience loved it.
They cried, clapped, and cheered, and they told their friends to see the show.
Today, people still tell their friends to see the show.
It continues to play to delighted audiences in London.
From London, the musical spread around the world.
More than fifty million people have seen the show performed in thirty-four countries in twenty different languages.
In London, hundreds of people have written to the director describing how they were moved and changed by the show.
Many people wrote about personal problems that they overcame.
They said the show gave them a feeling of optimism that made them stop their self-pity.
The show also inspired the casts to work together to raise money for good causes.
No other play in the history of theater has raised so much money for charity, particularly the homeless.
Although not every country has experienced the revolutions and social problems of France, everyone can understand the kind of social injustice that Hugo writes about.
The book and the musical tell the story of human suffering, but give a message of hope.
That message touches people everywhere.
