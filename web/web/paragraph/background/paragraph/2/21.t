Love and Learn: Two Poems.
The young and the old often have very different ideas about life.
The young, we might say, are full of passion and ready to grasp the moment.
The old, who have been made wiser by experience, are generally more cautious.
Perhaps this is most true when it comes to love.
Oftentimes, a young boy or girl will easily fall in loveXand just as easily fall out of love!
A more mature person, on the other hand, will know that true love takes time to grow, and that it rarely happens quickly.
He or she also knows that love can bring not only happiness, but also sorrow and regret, and therefore, it should be approached with wariness and patience.
But how do older people know these things?
Ah, it is only because they were once young also!
They made their own mistakes in life and in love.
As an old English proverb goes, Live and learnXor, we might say, Love and learn. However, does that mean everyone must make mistakes in order to become wiser and more mature?
Or does it mean we should listen more closely to what advice our elders have to give us?
The following two poems offer some words of wisdom about falling in love too young.
When I Was One-and-Twenty
When I was one-and-twenty
I heard a wise man say,
Give crowns and pounds and guineas
But not your heart away;
Give pearls away and rubies
But keep your fancy free.
But I was one-and-twenty
No use to talk to me.
When I was one-and-twenty
I heard him say again,
The heart out of the bosom
Was never given in vain;
Tis paid with sighs a plenty
And sold for endless rue.
And I am two-and-twenty,
And oh, tis true, tis true.
Xby A. E. Housman (1859-1936)
Down by the Salley Gardens
Down by the salley gardens my love and I did meet;
She passed the salley gardens with little snow-white feet.
She bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree;
But I being young and foolish, with her would not agree.
In a field by the river my love and I did stand,
And on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow-white hand.
She bid me take life easy, as the grass grows on the weirs;
But I was young and foolish, and now am full of tears.
by William Butler Yeats (l-1939)
