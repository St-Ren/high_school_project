Coming home from school, Jack sensed
something was odd.
His mother was sitting
contentedly in the living room reading a
She was always in the kitchen when
he got home.
Hi, Mom, he said.
What can I have for a snack?
I dont know, his mother answered.
Jack was surprised by her reply.
She always had a snack that he liked waiting for him.
He grabbed some spoiled potato chips, but soon regretted it.
Are you sick or something, Mom he called from the kitchen.
No, why she asked.
Oh, you just seem kind of different, Jack answered.
Soon, his sister, Martha, arrived.
She was surprised to see her mother in the living room, too.
Are you ill, Mom she asked on her way to the bedroom.
No, her mother answered.
Im just reading a very good story aboutX
Mother! Martha yelled from the bedroom.
Wheres my dress for tonight?
Martha, you interrupted me.
Your dress is in the ironing basket.
Martha frantically went through the basket of clothes that needed to be pressed.
She looked over at Jack, who was still searching for something to eat.
Whats the matter with Mom she whispered.
I dont know, Jack replied.
Martha set up the ironing board, plugged in the iron, and began to iron.
She was really outraged because normally her mother would have done it for her.
Then Dad came home.
They could hear him talking to their mother in the living room.
Soon Dad came out into the kitchen, too.
Well, it seems as if your mother is taking the night off, he said.
I suppose we can all pitch in and make dinner tonight.
Jack and Martha complained and whined.
But Dad said, Well, if anybody wants dinner, theyd better get busy.
Dad, do you think theres something wrong with Mom Jack asked as they tried to cook something for dinner.
I guess shes just tired, Jack, he answered.
Well just try to help out for a few days.
Then they looked over at the stove.
The soup was overflowing the pot.
When they finished cooking, the kitchen was a mess.
After dinner Mom cleared the table and then went in to watch television.
The next morning Jack reached into his socks drawer.
There werent any.
Because his mother had already gone to work, he had to get a pair out of the dirty clothes basket.
Later at school, Jack told his friend Steve about the bizarre way his mother was acting.
Well, thats peculiar, Steve said.
Arent mothers supposed to do household chores?
When Jack and Martha got home that afternoon, they found that things were just the same; they decided to speak with their aunt, Grace.
After they told her what happened, Aunt Grace said, But she has worked all day, so you cant say shes not doing anything.
Surely youre old enough to do something to help out around the house.
Why should she carry the whole burden?
But she does things better, Jack answered.
Aunt Grace was smiling by then.
Martha thought that she knew more than she was letting on.
Three days later, things were still the same.
Jack and Martha decided to talk to Dad.
Later, they went in to see their mother.
Honey, were so worried about you that we decided to come and see what is wrong, Dad said.
Is that because theres no food in the kitchen and all the clothes are dirty she asked.
Youve never acWell, its very simple, Mother
I work, your father works, and you
both go to school.
We all have our jobs.
But when we get home, something happens.
What happens Jack asked.
Suddenly I am the only one doing any work.
Jack, you get a snack that I prepare.
Then you go out to shoot baskets.
Martha, you spend most of your time on the phone.
Your father cuts the lawn on Saturday, and thats about it.
But, Mom, we thought you liked to take care of us, Martha whined.
I did when you were little.
But now youre grown up, Mother said.
Its time that things changed.
But thats the way everybody lives, Jack said.
You never asked what I really like to do, Mother said.
I am part of the family, too.
Dad, Jack, and Martha all looked at one another.
Things had been good the way they were.
But now....
