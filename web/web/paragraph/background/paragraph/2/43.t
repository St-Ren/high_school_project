Recycle your cell phones, and you may rescue African gorillas.
What kind of connection, you may ask, could there possibly be here?
Well, to understand this connection, we first need to know what problems your cell phones might cause.
There are already billions of cell phone users worldwide, and the number is still increasing.
Many users even have more than one cell phone.
The average lifespan of a cell phone, according to many studies, is less than two years, so billions of cell phones are out of use every year.
Have you ever wondered what happens to all these old cell phones?
In fact, 2% of old cell phones will simply be thrown away.
Another 7% are lying around in people's drawers, and may also end up in landfills.
In other words, 9% of old cell phones are treated as trash, although most of them are still usable.
Only 5% are recycled.
Among these recycled cell phones, some are refurbished for resale, and some are donated for charity or emergency use.
The rest are broken into their essential elements for other uses.
You may already know why it is important that old cell phones be recycled.
Cell phones contain many dangerous chemicals, such as copper or lead.
They are known as Persistent, Bioaccumulative, and Toxic Chemicals (PBTs), which will stay in our environment for a long time and harm living creatures.
Some people, however, are imaginative enough to believe recycling old cell phones may have something to do with the well-being of far-away African gorillas.
The key to such a connection lies in one of the PBTs, called coltan, which is widely used in cell phones.
Eighty percent of the world's known coltan supply is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in central Africa, which is also home to the world's endangered gorillas.
In order to mine the coltan, workers often overrun and destroy the once-protected gorilla habitat.
Over the period of just a few years, there has been a 9% decline in the gorilla population.
Because of the worldwide cell phone boom, the increasing demand for coltan is unavoidable.
However, what about the future of these endangered gorillas?
The Santa Barbara Zoo and 8 other zoos across the United States hope to come to their rescue.
They are running a program that highlights this connection between coltan and gorillas.
They educate people to recycle their old cell phones, hoping to reduce the demand for coltan.
They refurbish the collected old cell phones for resale, and use the money to support rescue projects for the gorillas.
Maybe it is over-optimistic to assume that recycling old cell phones can rescue the gorillas from extinction.
However, this program raises public awareness that it is negligent to throw away outdated cell phones instead of recycling them.
Not only does it pollute the environment, but it endangers the survival of a species somewhere on our planet.
So think twice before you get a new cell phone.
If you do need a new one, be sure to recycle your old one.
