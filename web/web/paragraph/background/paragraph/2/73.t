Miyazaki's World of Fantasy.
Some call him Sensei of Anime and others the Japanese Walt Disney.
He is Hayao Miyazaki, a great animator and director from Japan.
For many years, he has taken his fans to his world of fantasy.
He is fond of putting in his films such scenes as flying machines, strong females, and funny pigs.
Miyazaki was born into a wealthy family in Tokyo in 1941.
His family grew prosperous by making parts for fighter aircraft during World War II.
That was why he lived a life of ease as a little boy.
It was during that time that Miyazaki began to draw airplanes and developed a fascination with flying, which consequently became a recurring theme in his films.
In his third year in senior high, he saw the film Hakujaden, "the first-ever Japanese feature-length color anime," and his interest in animation started to grow.
After college, he decided to be an animator.
In 1984, Miyazaki released Nausica?
of the Valley of the Wind, based on his own manga (comic books).
He then started his own animation company.
Since then, he has directed and made many other films.
All of them have been very popular.
The Princess Mononoke, in particular, received the Japanese Academy Award for Best Film.
It was also Japan's highest grossing film, but that record was later broken by another Miyazaki film, Spirited Away.
In Miyazaki's films, no one is truly good and no one is truly evil.
For example, in The Princess Mononoke, Lady Eboshi is a rich woman who makes rifles.
However, the reason she makes guns is because she wants to protect her village.
Miyazaki likes to make films for children and young people.
His films always encourage them to look at life and the future optimistically.
In Kiki's Delivery Service, Kiki, a young witch, travels to a new town with her cat.
She runs into many hardships, but she finally learns how to gain confidence through difficulties.
Miyazaki once said, "I wish there were such people, such things, and such a world."
After Miyazaki was awarded a Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the 2005 Venice International Film Festival, he said, "I want to create films that inspire children."
In fact, adults also like Miyazaki's films very much, because he has created a world of fantasy where everyone can make their dreams take flight.
