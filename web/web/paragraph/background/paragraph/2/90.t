Mathilde was one of those pretty and charming young girls who were  born into a family of clerks.
She had no hope of being matched with any rich man, so she married a clerk of a government office.
She dressed plainly because she didn't have any pretty dresses, and she suffered because she felt that she deserved the delicacies and all luxuries.
She would have liked so much to be pleased, to be envied, to be charming, and to be sought after.
One evening, her husband reached home holding a large envelope.
"There is something for you," he said.
She tore the envelope quickly and drew out a card that read:
The Minister of Public Instruction requests the honor of M.2 and Madame Loisel's company at the palace of the Ministry on Monday evening, January 18th.
However, she was not delighted with the news, and she threw the invitation on the table.
"What do you wish me to do with that?"
she asked angrily.
"Why, my dear, I thought you would be glad.
You never go out, and this is a very special opportunity.
It was very difficult for me to get the invitation."
She looked at him with an irritated glance and said impatiently: "And what do you wish me to wear?"
"What about the gown you wear to the theater?
It looks very nice to  me," he answered.
He stopped, seeing that his wife was weeping.
"What's the matter?"
"Nothing.
Only I have no lovely gown.
no gown I can't go to this ball."
"Well, how much would a suitable gown,
which you can wear over again, cost?"
"Maybe four hundred francs," she replied.
He grew a little pale, but said, "Very well.
give you four hundred francs for a suitable gown."
The day of the ball drew near and Madame Loisel seemed sad and anxious.
"What is the matter?"
asked Loisel.
"It frustrates me not to have a single piece of jewelry to put on."
"How silly you are!"
her husband cried.
"Go look up your dear old  friend, Madame Forestier, and ask her to lend you some jewels.
You're intimate enough with her to do that."
"True!
I never thought of it," she exclaimed happily.
The next day she went to her friend and told her of her distress.
Madame Forestier took out a large jewel box and asked Madame Loisel to choose the one that she liked.
She tried on many pieces until she found a special diamond necklace.
She put it on, and asked, "Can I have this one?"
"Why, yes, certainly."
She hugged her friend, and then hurried home with the necklace.
The night of the ball arrived.
Madame Loisel was prettier than any   other woman present.
All the men looked at her, asked her name, wishing    to be introduced.
She danced and danced forgetting all her troubles.
She felt special and beautiful with the attention she received.
She and her husband left the ball about four o'clock in the morning.
With so many people rushing out trying to get a cab home, Mathilde and her husband had to walk in the cold for more than a few blocks until they could find a cab.
When they reached home, she took off her wrap and suddenly  cried out.
"What is the matter with you?"
asked her husband.
"The necklace is gone."
"What!
Impossible!"
exclaimed her husband.
He went outside to look for the necklace, following the same route  where they had walked, but it was useless to do so.
Finally, after a dreadful week, Loisel decided, "We must replace the lost necklace."
They went from shop to shop, and finally found a necklace that seemed exactly like the one they had lost.
It cost thirty-six thousand francs.
Loisel possessed eighteen thousand francs which his father had left him and he planned to borrow the rest.
His life would be ruined.
When Madame Loisel took the necklace to Madame Forestier, she said coolly, "You should have returned it earlier."
From then on, Madame Loisel knew how awful it was to be needy.
They had to pay off the debt.
They let their maid go and moved to a small, cheap apartment.
Mathilde had to bargain carefully at the market and she learned how unpleasant housework could be.
Her husband worked evenings, copying manuscripts to earn a little more money.
After ten years of living in miserable poverty, they had paid everything back.
Madame Loisel looked old now-strong, hard, and rough like any working woman you'd see on the street.
And then, one Sunday, having gone for a walk in the park to relax after the hard work of the week, she suddenly saw a woman who looked familiar.
It was Madame Forestier!
But, she still looked young and pretty.
She went up to her old friend.
  "Good-day, Jeanne."
The other, not recognizing her at all, said, "But-Madame!-I do not know...."
"No.
I'm Mathilde Loisel."
"Oh, my poor Mathilde!
How you are changed!"
"Yes, I have had a hard life since I last saw you-and that is because of you!"
"Because of me!
"Do you remember that diamond necklace you lent me to wear at the ball?"
"Yes.
"Well, I lost it."
"What do you mean?
You brought it back."
"I brought you back another one exactly like it.
And it has taken us ten years to pay for it.
At last the nightmare is over, and I'm very glad."
"You mean that you bought a necklace of diamonds to replace mine?"
"Yes.
You never noticed it, then!"
Madame Forestier, deeply moved, took her old friend's hands.
"Oh, my poor Mathilde!
Why, those were fake diamonds!
The necklace was worth no more than five hundred francs!"
