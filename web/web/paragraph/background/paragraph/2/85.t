 All of us have experienced some symptoms of stress.
Whether we have stomach problems or difficulty sleeping, at some point our stress may cause some uncomfortable reactions.
Sure, stress is a normal part of life, but it's  clear that too much stress can be bad for our health.
Stress can be put into two categories: mental or physical.
Mental stress is caused by such things as worries over schoolwork or a loved one's health, or loss of a loved one.
Physical stress can be a result of too little sleep, poor diet, or the effects of an illness.
Basically, when dealing with a stressful
situation, your body will react so it can quickly
and effectively deal with the situation.
if you are in this condition over many
hours of each day, and if stress cannot
be addressed in a healthy way, your
body will suffer and may experience
such health problems as high blood
pressure and heart disease.
To be sure, all of us handle stress in our own
But there are some healthy ways to deal with
whatever stress comes your way.
