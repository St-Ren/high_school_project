Steve Biko, the third child in a black family, was born in South Africa.
His father was a clerk and his mother was a maid.
Biko did not have the opportunity to know his father because he died when Biko was only four years old.
Steve Biko did extremely well in school as a youth but his political activities caused him to be kicked out of high school.
Biko was nevertheless able to continue on to college because he received a scholarship to study
medicine in St. Francis College, a Catholic boarding school.
While in medical school, Biko became involved in the NUSAS (National Union of South African Students), a multiracial, politically moderate organization.
It was while he was at St. Francis that Biko began questioning the apartheid system and the conditions that his people were forced to endure.
fight those conditions, he became more involved in the daily struggle that blacks faced, and he decided to quit medical school.
In 1968, Steve Biko helped form the all-Black South African Students Organization and became its first president.
The main aim of the organization was to raise black consciousness in South Africa through lectures and community activities.
Biko felt that the apartheid system had a mental effect on the black population.
It had caused blacks to believe that they were inferior to whites, and it resulted in the lack of hope that black people felt.
Biko encouraged blacks to break the chains of oppression.
Bikos political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African government, which resulted in him being banned in 1973.
The banning restricted Biko from talking to more than one person at a time.
Its aim was to try to stop the rising political movement.
However, it did not stop Bikos work.
For the next four years, he continued to spread his message with his publication called Frank Talk. During this period Biko was often harassed, arrested, and held by the South African Police.
On August 18, 1977, Biko was seized by the police and held under Section 6 of the Terrorism Act.
Biko was held in prison for twenty-four days where he was questioned, starved, and beaten.
It was not until Biko was lying unconscious that the doctors suggested that he be transported to the capital city for medical treatment, 740 miles away.
On September 12, 1977, Biko became the forty-first person in South Africa to die while being held by the South African Police.
The South African government stated that Steve Bikos death was caused by a hunger strike and that they were not guilty of any wrongdoing.
However, the official report showed that Bikos death was caused by brain injury from the application of force to the head. Bikos tragic death had a great effect on the people of South Africa and shocked the world.
His funeral was attended by more than 15,000 people, not including the thousands that were turned away by the police.
The memory of Steve Biko lives on through the struggle he helped to start and through the freedom that South Africans now possess.
