General Douglas MacArthur is an American war hero.
He was born in 1 into a family with a long tradition of serving in the military.
MacArthur went to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated with distinction.
On his first assignment, he was sent to Asia to serve in the Philippines and Japan.
Later he also served in Central America and Europe.
In 1, MacArthur was made commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East.
And that is where he performed his most remarkable feats.
While battling in the Pacific, MacArthur wrote this prayer.
It was for his only child, Arthur MacArthur IV, who had been named after Douglas MacArthur's grandfather, another outstanding general.
Even though Arthur didn't follow in his father's footsteps and studied art instead, this prayer remains as a significant piece of writing.
It uses beautiful language and shows a great man's high expectations of his son.
As a matter of fact, this prayer is not just a letter that is addressed to God but a message to all the youth.
Build me a son, O Lord, who will be strong enough to know when he is weak, and brave enough to face himself when he is afraid; one who will be proud and unbending in honest defeat, and humble and gentle in victory.
Build me a son whose wishbone will not be where his backbone should be; a son who will know Thee -and that to know himself is the foundation stone of knowledge.
Lead him, I pray, not in the path of ease and comfort, but under the stress and spur of difficulties and challenges.
Here let him learn to stand up in the storm; here let him learn compassion for those who fail.
Build me a son whose heart will be clear, whose goal will be high; a son who will master himself before he seeks to master other men; one who will learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep; one who will reach into the future, yet never forget the past.
And after all these things are his, add, I pray, enough of a sense of humor, so that he may always be serious, yet never take himself too seriously.
Give him humility, so that he may always remember the simplicity of true greatness, the open mind of true wisdom, the meekness of true strength.
Then, I, his father, will dare to whisper, "I have not lived in vain!"
