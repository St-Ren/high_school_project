Unit 9  Our True Self Lies Within.
Psychologists in the U.S.A. once conducted a psychological study called the Scar Experiment, which stirred up a lot of public discussion.
At the beginning of the experiment, the researchers told ten volunteers that the objective of this experiment was to observe how people would respond when seeing someone with a physical defect, particularly a person with a scar on his or her face.
After learning about the purpose of the study, volunteers in this experiment were then placed in separate rooms with no mirrors.
There, a make?up artist put an artificial scar on the left cheek of each participant.
Then, the participant was shown his or her new look.
Next, they were informed that a sticky substance would be applied to their faces for fear that the make?up might come off.
The false scar, however, was actually secretly swept away.
Later, these people were sent to the waiting rooms of different clinics to experience how people would react to them.
Afterward, when they returned to the research laboratory, they reported that people were unfriendly to them and repeatedly peeped at their scars.
In reality, these volunteers looked the same as usual.
Their consciousness of other peoples unkind acts was a result of their own assumption: They believed that the scar would inevitably draw peoples attention and cause other people to treat them rudely and offensively.
That is, they were influenced by a sense of inferiority.
A sense of inferiority, according to the researchers, is strongly associated with the environment in which one develops.
If children get criticized continually as they become mature, they are bound to be confronted with an identity crisis and may even cheapen themselves in the course of time.
As kids grow up, negative remarks can turn into mental scars.
These negative remarks may also bruise their egos, shake their confidence, and, hence, affect how they value themselves.
Lena Marias life story is a great example of how environment can be a significant influence on that person.
Physically challenged from birth, Lena has only one leg and no upper limbs.
Even so, her parents raised her like an ordinary kid for fear of having her believe that she was inferior to others.
Her parents love for her has known no bounds, and this has made her appreciate her life, however limited it might be.
Whats more, her cheerful mentality has always spiced up her life.
For example, one day, a girl in her class intended to embarrass her by sarcastically saying, Good morning, Girl With Only One Leg. Not even upset, Lena replied with a beaming smile, Good morning, Two-legged Girl. Apparently, she has never felt different from others, despite her birth defects.
Whether we are facially scarred or physically deficient in some way, others cant hurt our feelings as long as we bravely embrace ourselves and enjoy life to the fullest.
However, if we deprive ourselves of our own self-esteem and regard ourselves as unworthy, then a mere pimple on the face can cause us to have insecurity problems in our relationships.
Dont let a sense of inferiority, a scar, or even a pimple steer us wrong.
After all, people see us just the way we see ourselves.
