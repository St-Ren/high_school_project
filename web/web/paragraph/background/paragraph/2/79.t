A group of young people were going to Florida.
They got on the bus at 34th Street, carrying sandwiches and wine in paper bags, dreaming of golden beaches and sea tides as the gray, cold spring of New York vanished behind them.
Vingo was on the bus from the beginning.
As the bus passed through New Jersey, they began to observe that Vingo never moved.
He was sitting in front of the young people, dressed in a plain suit that did not fit him.
His fingers were stained from smoking too many cigarettes .
Deep into the night, the bus stopped at a restaurant and everybody got
off except Vingo.
The young people began to wonder about him: perhaps
he was a sea captain; maybe he had run away from his wife; he could be an
old soldier going home.
When they went back to the bus, one of the girls sat beside him and introduced herself.
"We're going to Florida," she said brightly.
"I hear it's really beautiful."
"It is," he said quietly, as if recalling something he had tried to forget.
"Are you married?"
"I don't know."
"You don't know?"
"Well," he said shyly.
"When I was in jail, I wrote to my wife.
I told her that if she couldn't stand it, if the kids kept asking questions, if it hurt too much, well, she could just forget me.
I'd understand.
I told her she didn't
have to write me.
And she didn't.
Not for three and a half years."
"You are going home now, even though you haven't heard anything?"
the girl asked.
"Well, last week when I was sure I would get parole, I wrote her again.
We used to live in this town, Brunswick, and there's a great big oak tree just
as you come into town.
I told her if she'd take me back, she should put a yellow ribbon on the tree, and I'd get off and come home.
If she didn't want me, forget it; no ribbon and I'd keep on going through."
"Wow," the girl said.
She told the others, and they all became excited.
As the bus approached Brunswick, Vingo was showing them a picture of his wife and three children.
Now they were twenty miles from Brunswick, and the young people took  over window seats on the right side, waiting for the approach of the great oak tree.
Vingo stopped looking out; he seemed to be getting ready for a great disappointment.
As the bus neared Brunswick, the passengers became very quiet.
Then suddenly all of the young people were up out of their seats, screaming and shouting, doing small dances, shaking fists in triumph and joy.
All except Vingo.
Vingo sat there astonished, looking at the oak tree.
It was covered with yellow ribbons, twenty of them, thirty of them, maybe hundreds.
The tree  stood like a flag of welcome, fluttering and waving in the wind.
As the young people shouted, Vingo slowly stood up from his seat and made his way to the front of the bus.
He was going home.
