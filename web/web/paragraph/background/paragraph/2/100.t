Theres nothing like being in love.
Minutes seem to creep and fly by at the same time.
We get lost on the way home, thinking of the next date.
Music cries out to us alone, and the full moon winks at our way.
Long after other memories fade, the recollection of love lingers.
Its pure magic.
Or at least thats what we like to tell ourselves.
Despite all the advances scientists are making to explain the idea of love, we still want to believe that science will never tame romance.
Were sure that love will always remain utterly separate from the cells and organs.
And indeed, how could anything that so moves us to poetry and song be reducible to behavior and chemicals?
Charles Darwin started answering questions like this when he published his book The Descent of Man in 1871.
Darwin granted that his readers might doubt that humans evolved from an ancestral ape.
As man differs so greatly in his mental power from all other animals, there must be some error in this conclusion, he wrote.
But he argued that the difference between us and other animals was of degree, not of kind.
That applied not just to our teeth and toes but also to our morals and minds.
And even, he declared, to love.
Man is a rational animal, Aristotle declared, but experiments have demonstrated that reason is not a gift of our species alone.
In a study published in 2007, researchers reported that monkeys were almost as good as college students at arithmetic.
And our rationality is not a simple reasoning process but a complicated picture of strengths and weaknesses.
We are good at solving reasoning problems if they are presented as social issues.
We dont do as well if the same problems are expressed in logic.
A number of researchers argue that unlike other creatures, humans evolve to care and love, not to reason only.
Martie Haselton, a psychologist at UCLA, is exploring the forces that may have shaped the modern love.
She believes it all comes down to the long-term
health of children.
Haselton calls romantic love a commitment device, a mechanism that encourages two humans to form a lasting bond.
Those bonds help ensure that children survive, getting fed and cared for by two parents rather than one.
Natural selection has built love to make us feel romantic, she says.
In her experiments, Haselton finds evidence for love as an adaptation.
People use love as a drive to form a long-term commitment.
Haseltons conclusion does not degrade love.
Instead, she tells us that humans choose romance as a way to adapt and to evolve.
When we say that romance has an evolutionary history, we dont mean its identical to what other animals experience.
Our ancestors branched off from other apes long time ago and have taken their own evolutionary journey since.
Falling in love may be natural, but that doesnt mean its not exceptional.
