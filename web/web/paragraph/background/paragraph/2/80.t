Animal World is a talk show that discusses topics related to animals.
What do today's speakers think about animal rights?
Host:Welcome to Animal World.
Today's program is about animal rights.
Now, most of our viewers probably have already made up their minds about animal rights, but we have two guests here today to challenge our perspectives.
Let's start with Dr. Faye.
Dr. Faye, would you please introduce yourself and tell us what you do?
Dr. Faye:Sure, I'm a medical researcher at 2Pharmco Labs.
I do experiments on animals to find cures for human diseases.
Mr. Bates:I'm Charlie Bates.
And I'm here as the president of FOA, Friends of Animals.
I promote animal rights.
Host:Let's start there, Mr. Bates, what do you mean by animal rights?
Mr. Bates:For me, it means that animals deserve to live according to their natures, free from harm, abuse, and exploitation.
Humans have rights, and so do animals.
Dr. Faye:Oh, that's ridiculous.
Animals have no rights.
Humans have always used animals in their daily lives.
Host:Okay, now it is obvious that you two don't agree.
Dr. Faye:That's right.
It's obvious that FOA thinks animals have rights, but they don't.
Animals are animals.
That's it.
How can animals have rights?
Host:Well, Dr. Faye, aren't humans animals?
Dr. Faye:Well, humans and animals are similar in some ways.
All need to breathe, to eat, and to sleep.
But we have nothing else in common with them.
Mr. Bates:Oh, come on.
Give me a break.
We have a lot in common with other animals.
We need to give animals the same respect that we give to each other.
Dr. Faye:But Mr. Bates, surely you recognize that there are important differences.
Humans are superior to other animals.
Mr. Bates:No, no, no, no, no.
That is so wrong!
Dr. Faye:Let me....
Mr. Bates:To think that we're better than animals.... No.
Dr. Faye:Look, let me finish, Mr. Bates.
We have languages, right?
We have civilizations....
Mr. Bates:Yeah.
Dr. Faye:We have art.
Because of those differences, I feel that humans can use other animals.
We can use them for food and clothing; we can use them for medical research to help humans live better and longer.
Mr. Bates:You're right that we have additional abilities that animals don't have, but that's exactly why we should protect them.
We don't need to hunt them and eat them, or to capture them and put them in zoos.
We don't need to hurt them at all.
We can develop substitutes for everything that we now use animals for.
Dr. Faye:Animals aren't worth all that trouble.
I believe humans need to
use other animals for food, clothing, and medical research.
In my opinion, we can use other animals for anything we want.
Host:Well, we'll have to cut this off now, but we will continue the discussion after the break.
