Just as artists paint with different colors, poets create pictures in the reader's mind with images made of words.
These "images" help the reader to build up a mental picture of what poets want to say or describe, and to see or feel it on a deep level.
The following is an example.
In a Station of the Metro
The apparition of these faces in the crowd;
Petals on a wet, black bough.
-Ezra Pound (-)-
Pound said he wrote this poem to express exactly the experience of a particular moment.
Upon getting off a train one day in a crowded Paris subway station, he was struck by the beauty of the faces he saw.
He later described this "impression" in a poem thirty lines long.
But then he realized that unless he could do it in just two lines, it wouldn't be true to the experience.
Each line contains a single image, and the two images combine into a striking metaphor: the faces seen by the poet as he walked past looked like petals emerging from a "wet, black bough."
At that moment, this was how they actually looked to him; the metaphor catches the real experience.
If this also looks like an oriental image, it is because Pound was very interested in classical Chinese and Japanese cultures.
He said the above poem was like a Japanese haiku, a very short poem that uses just two or three images to create a precise picture in the reader's mind.
When the individual images are fresh and clear and fit together naturally, their combination will be very powerful.
This "picture" will be likely to help the reader see things in a new way.
The following are some examples of haikus.
In them, you will read how these poets captured certain moments of their life experience with vivid images.
Remember that images are not necessarily visual; poems can use imagery that refers to any of the five senses-sight, sound, smell, taste or touch.
On the One-Ton Temple Bell
On the one-ton temple bell
A moonmoth, folded into sleep,
Sits still.
-Yosa Buson (-), translated by X. J. Kennedy-
In the Old Stone Pool
In the old stone pool
A frog jumps;
Splishhhhhhhh.
-Matsuo Basho (-), translated by X. J. Kennedy-
The Piercing Chill I Feel
The piercing chill I feel:
My dead wife's comb, in our bedroom,
Under my heel.
-Taniguchi Buson, translated by Harold G. Henderson-
While reading these haikus, can you picture the immense stillness conveyed through the lively images?
With their creative mind, poets, like painters, turn ordinary sights and sounds into images that create a poetic space where the reader may wander and wonder.
Now we are going to read a few more poems written by Chinese Tang poets and by a contemporary American.
Each creates a certain mood through the sophisticated use of images.
While reading them, you may try to take note of the key images and see what kind of atmosphere or state of mind is created through them.
Deer Enclosure
In empty mountains not a soul in sight,
Yet I hear echoes of people talking on site.
Through thick woods comes dim twilight;
Its reflection on green moss seems so bright.
-Wang Wei (-)-
Snow on the River
Not a bird in a hundred hills.
Not a soul on a thousand trails.
Old man on boat in straw quilts,
Fishes alone in snowy chills.
-Liu Zong-yuan (-)-
Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
Robert Frost (-)
