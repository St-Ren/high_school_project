Unit  Anne Franks Diary.
In the years leading up to World War II, and also throughout the war, the Nazi government of Germany adopted a racist policy that led to the murder of millions of Jews, known as the Holocaust.
In Germany and in the countries occupied by the German army, Jews were made to wear a yellow star so that they could be easily identified.
They were also rounded up and sent to concentration camps, where they were shot, gassed, or left to die of starvation or disease.
The only chance of survival was to hide, so Anne Frank and her family lived in hiding for two years in a place called the Secret Annex.
During that period, she kept a diary.

Dearest Kitty,
This morning I was constantly interrupted.
As a result, I havent been able to finish a single thing Ive begun.
We have a new recreation, namely, filling packages with powdered gravy.
The gravy is one of Gies & Co.s products.
Mr. Kugler hasnt been able to find anyone else to do the job.
Besides, our wages are lower.
Its the kind of work they do in prisons.
Its incredibly boring and makes us dizzy and giggly.
Terrible things are happening outside.
At any time of night and day, poor, helpless people are being dragged out of their homes.
Theyre allowed to take only a rucksack and a little cash with them, and even then, theyre robbed of their possessions on the way.
Families are torn apart; men, women, and children are separated.
Children come home from school to find that their parents have disappeared.
Women return from shopping to find their houses sealed and their families gone.
The Christians in Holland are also living in fear because their sons are being sent to Germany.
Everyone is scared.
Every night, hundreds of planes pass over Holland on their way to German cities, to sow their bombs on German soil.
Every hour, hundredsXor maybe even thousandsXof people are being killed in Russia and Africa.
No one can keep out of the conflict; the entire world is at war.
Even though the Allies are doing better, the end is nowhere in sight.
As for us, were quite fortunateXluckier than millions of people.
Its quiet and safe here, and were using our money to buy food.
Were so selfish that we talk about after the war and look forward to new clothes and shoes, when actually we should lay aside every penny to help others when the war is over and save whatever we can.
The children in this neighborhood run around in thin shirts and wooden clogs.
They have no coats, no socks, no caps, and no one to help them.
Gnawing on a carrot to ease their hunger pain, they walk from their cold houses through cold streets to an even colder classroom.
Things have gotten so bad in Holland that crowds of children stop passers-by in the streets to beg for a piece of bread.
I could spend hours telling you about the suffering the war has caused, but Id only make myself more miserable.
All we can do is wait, as calmly as possible, for it to end.
Jews and Christians alike are waiting; the whole world is waiting, and many are waiting for death.
Anne Franks story did not have a happy ending.
After two years of hiding, Anne and her family were betrayed to the Nazi authorities.
They were all captured by the Gestapo and then sent to different concentration camps.
Otto Frank, Annes father, was the sole survivor of the Holocaust in the Frank family.
Fortunately, Annes diary had been kept safe during the war.
After Otto Frank read his daughters diary, he decided to have it published so that other people could read not only about the horrors of war but also about the love, family, and friendship that had given Anne hope.
Today, millions of people have read Anne Franks diary, and the Secret Annex has become a museum in memory of the people who suffered so many hardships and those who died in the Holocaust.
