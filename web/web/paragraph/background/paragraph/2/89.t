Greek mythology, a major part of Western heritage, has had an  extensive influence on its culture, art, and literature.
Poets and artists from ancient times to the present have found inspiration in Greek mythology,  which centers on many Greek and Roman gods and heroes.
One of the most thrilling stories of ancient Greek mythology is that of brave Bellerophon and his winged horse, Pegasus.
Bellerophon was a young man of great strength and courage.
His father,  as it was said, was Poseidon, god of the sea.
His mother was Euronyme, a mortal woman of deep wisdom who had been taught by the goddess Athena.
With two such parents, no wonder Bellerophon seemed more like a god than  a regular human.
He was famous throughout Greece for his bravery and sense of adventure, but he was perhaps most famous for the wonderful horse that  he rode.
For a long time, Bellerophon's greatest wish had been to be the master  of Pegasus, a magical winged horse.
Pegasus could fly as fast as the wind and never grew tired.
Bellerophon tried to dream up ways to catch the great horse, but he could think of none.
At last, he asked a famous wise man what to do, and he told Bellerophon to spend the night in the temple of Athena.
Perhaps the goddesses would come to him in a dream and show him how to charm Pegasus.
That night in the temple, beneath the stars, Bellerophon fell into a deep sleep.
As he slept, the goddess Athena appeared and gave him a wonderful golden bridle unlike any ever made by humans.
If Bellerophon could catch Pegasus with this bridle, Athena promised, the horse would be his.
When he woke up, Bellerophon feared Athena's visit was only a dream.
But then he saw the shining bridle beside
him and knew the dream was true.
Seizing the bridle, he rushed to the
fields in order to catch Pegasus.
The horse stood in the middle of the field drinking from a spring, his wings shining in the light of the morning sun.
Bellerophon was not sure how  to get the magic bridle onto Pegasus, so he approached the powerful horse  with caution.
Much to the young man's surprise, Pegasus stayed calm and quietly let Bellerophon slip the bridle over his head.
Bellerophon was filled with joy as he realized that Athena had made   the great Pegasus his.
Quickly, he leaped upon the winged horse's back, and together they flew to the sky.
Flying through the clouds, the two became close friends.
Bellerophon proudly rode the magical stallion wherever he wished.
In the years that followed, Pegasus helped him meet many great challenges.
Perhaps the most difficult one was killing Chimera.
She was a terribly dangerous fire-breathing creature with the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent.
This fantastic monster had killed many men who had come to her cave.
She hit with her poisonous tail and struck with her  lion claws.
Her burning dragon's breath could melt a man.
No one thought  she could be beaten.
There was an evil king who sent Bellerophon to kill Chimera because he was certain Bellerophon would fail and would be killed.
But Bellerophon was not afraid.
As Bellerophon and Pegasus came closer to Chimera's cave on top of a mountain, they could hear the scary sound of the monster; they could see the flames leaping from her jaws.
But they were in no danger, for they flew above her, safely beyond her.
Then Pegasus came down low over the monster, and Bellerophon shot arrow after arrow from his big strong bow.
The animal fell to the ground   and died.
Bellerophon and Pegasus flew off without being hurt.
The king   was surprised by this success and sent Bellerophon on many other difficult adventures.
Each time Bellerophon succeeded with the help of Pegasus.
Their amazing acts were talked about throughout the land.
After years of high praise, Bellerophon's pride grew even greater,    and he began to believe he was as great as the gods.
In fact, he thought he should be allowed to live among the gods in their home on Mount Olympus.
Determined to reach that wonderful place so much, he turned Pegasus  toward the heavens.
Because Pegasus knew the gods would punish such pride, he refused to fly there and threw his master from his back, dropping him to  the earth below.
The gods did punish Bellerophon.
From then on, he was forced to  wander the land alone without friends.
His pride took him to a very sad end.
But the gods rewarded Pegasus for being wise and sensible.
They brought him to Olympus, where he became the favorite horse of Zeus, ruler of all the gods.
