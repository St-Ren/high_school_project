The Influence of the Stars.
It was a brand-new school year.
Sitting in the homeroom, Christine was looking around to find someone she could make friends with.
Soon she noticed Josephine, who was confident when she answered their teachers questions.
Josephine also acted like a leader, helping the teacher collect different forms.
Later, during the students introductions, Linda impressed Christine with her ability to make fair comments.
On the other hand, when it was time to vote on class chores, Christine was surprised to see how shy and indecisive Steven was.
Christine wondered whether she could get along well with him.
A few days later, Christine told her older sister Jane what she had noticed on the first day of school.
Jane, who had been interested in astrology since entering college, asked Christine to find out when her classmates were born.
Then, she checked in her books to find their astrological signs and the corresponding personality traits.
Josephine is a Leo.
A Leo is as confident as a lion and likes to be the center of attention.
People born under this sign are excellent leaders because they are systematic.
They think highly of themselves, but they are still willing to help those in need.
Just like Christine, Josephine is outgoing.
Thus, Christine believes Josephine will be easy to make friends with.
Linda is a Libra.
Libras emphasize logic and they strictly follow rules.
Thus, a Libra is a perfect match for an Aquarius like Christine, because an Aquarius tends to stick to the rules as well.
Like a Libra, an Aquarius enjoys having a busy social life and appreciates beautiful things.
Steven is a Cancer, and Cancers are emotional.
People born under this sign lack confidence and often feel insecure.
They always need companions, while those born under the sign of Aquarius enjoy freedom.
However, there are good things about Cancers, too.
They love their families and are the best money managers among the twelve signs.
After reading her sisters astrology books, Christine felt she had gained knowledge about both herself and her classmates.
She could now understand more about her classmates and their individual differences, and she felt more confident that she would be able to get along with them.
It seemed that this new school year was opening its arms wide to welcome her!
