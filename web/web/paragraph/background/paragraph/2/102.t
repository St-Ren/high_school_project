MENDING WALL.
Something there is that doesnt love a wall,
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
And spills the upper boulders in the sun,
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
The work of hunters is another thing:
I have come after them and made repair
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
To please the yelping dogs.
The gaps I mean,
No one has seen them made or heard them made,
But at spring mending-time we find them there.
I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
And on a day we meet to walk the line
And set the wall between us once again.
We keep the wall between us as we go.
To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
We have to use a spell to make them balance:
Stay where you are until our backs are turned!
We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,
One on a side.
It comes to little more:
There where it is we do not need the wall:
He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
My apple trees will never get across
And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
He only says, Good fences make good neighbors.
Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder
If I could put a notion in his head:
Why do they make good neighbors?
Where there are cows?
But here there are no cows.
Before I built a wall Id ask to know
What I was walling in or walling out,
And to whom I was like to give offence.
Something there is that doesnt love a wall,
That wants it down.
I could say Elves to him,
But its not elves exactly, and Id rather
He said it for himself.
I see him there
Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.
He moves in darkness as it seems to me,
Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
He will not go behind his fathers saying,
And he likes having thought of it so well
He says again, Good fences make good neighbors.
By Robert Frost.
The speaker in Robert Frosts Mending Wall is questioning the purpose of the wall between his and his neighbors property.
Every year, the speaker and his neighbor need to repair the broken wall, yet, his neighbor is not interested in discussing whether or not the wall is necessary.
Something there is that doesnt love a wall.
The speaker begins by claiming that something there in nature seems to agree that the wall should be knocked down.
And that something might be the earth itself: That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,/And spills the upper boulders in the sun,/And makes gaps even two can pass abreast. When the earth beneath the wall freezes in winter, it contracts.
Then when spring comes, the earth expands because of the heat from the sun.
This causes
the stones that form the wall to fall down, leaving big gaps in the wall.
The work of hunters is another thing.
Even though the speaker mentions hunters may be responsible for these gaps as well because they destroy the sections as they follow their hunting dogs in pursuit of rabbits, by the line another thing, we can see that the speaker does not think hunting is the main cause; instead, something is.
And on a day we meet to walk the line.
So the speaker arranges to meet with his neighbor and repair the wall.
As they go about their mending, his neighbor remains on his side of the wall and the speaker on his own side.
They trade rocks that belong to each other across the wall.
Then the speaker describes what his stones look like: some are loaves and some so nearly balls. Since stones are sometimes difficult to get back into place, the speaker has a little fun by saying, We have to use a spell to make them balance:/Stay where you are until our backs are turned!
Oh, just another kind of outdoor game.
The speaker tries to create an atmosphere of fun and cheerfulness.
He remarks that this process of rebuilding the wall is just like an outdoor game,/One on a side. The speaker does not think fixing the wall is important because his neighbors property has only pine trees and his own property has only apple trees.
Therefore, the speaker tries to persuade his neighbor to give up mending the wall: My apple trees will never get across/And eat the cones under his pines. To this his neighbor just replies, Good fences make good neighbors. The speaker teases himself by saying, Spring is the mischief in me, as he playfully tries to get his neighbor to change his point of view about the wall.
However, he turns sober when he tries to inject the idea of not rebuilding the wall and he realizes that his neighbor will not change his mind.
But here there are no cows.
The speaker further explains that he could appreciate the need for fences if they had cows that might wander onto the others property and do damage.
But, since neither has any cows, it seems strange to keep a wall
between them.
If building walls were up to the speaker, he would want to be sure what the wall was for; or, he would be apt to consult his neighbor to make sure both neighbors have the same understanding about the need for the wall.
Something there is that doesnt love a wall, the speaker repeats his opening line, to which he now adds, That wants it down! He now feels strongly that the wall is not necessary.
I could say Elves to him.
Mischievously, the speaker imagines elves knocking down the wall.
If he should think of mentioning this to his neighbor, his neighbor might think he is crazy.
In the end, however, the speaker leaves off the elves idea.
His neighbor is not the kind of person who would appreciate a joke.
The speaker finally decides not to say anything to his neighbor who continues doing the dull repair work and repeats what his father has always said, Good fences make good neighbors. Failing to get a positive response from the neighbor, the only person the speaker amuses is himself.
