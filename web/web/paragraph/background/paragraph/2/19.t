The Happy Whitewasher.
Saturday morning had come, and all the summer world was bright and fresh.
There was a song in every heart and happiness in every step.
The locust trees were in bloom and their fragrance filled the air.
Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a brush.
He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him.
Thirty yards of fence, nine feet high.
Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden.
Sighing, he dipped his brush into the whitewash and passed it along the top.
Then he compared the small whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down discouraged.
He began to think of the fun he had planned for this day, and his sorrows grew even greater.
Soon the free boys would come along on all sorts of adventures, and they would make fun of him for having to workXthe very thought of it burnt him like fire.
He got out his worldly wealth and examined itXbits of toys, marbles, and trashXenough to buy an exchange of work, maybe, but not enough to buy half an hour of pure freedom.
So he gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys.
At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration flashed into his mind!
Nothing less than a magnificent inspiration!
He took up his brush and went to work.
Before long, Ben Rogers came in sightXthe very boy, of all boys, he dreaded most.
Ben was eating an apple, and giving a long whoop, for he was pretending to be a steamboat.
Ting-a-ling-ling! he shouted as he moved slowly down the street.
Ting-a-ling-ling!
Ding-dong-dong!
Ding-dong-dong!
Tom went on whitewashing, paying no attention to the steamboat.
Ben stopped his boat and stared a moment and then said, Hi!
You have to work today, dont you?
No answer.
Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist.
Ben walked up alongside him.
Toms mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work.
Ben said, Say, Im going swimming.
Dont you wish you could?
But of course youd rather work.
Tom looked slowly over at the boy, and said, What do you call work?
Why, isnt that work?
Tom resumed his whitewashing, and said carelessly, Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isnt.
All I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer.
Come on, you dont mean to let on that you like it?
The brush continued to move.
Well, I dont see why I shouldnt.
Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?
That put the thing in a new light.
Ben stopped nibbling his apple.
Tom swept his brush back and forthXstepped back to note the effectXadded a touch here and thereXcriticized the effect again.
Ben watched every move, getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed.
After a short time, he said, Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.
Tom consideredXwas about to consent, but he changed his mind.
No, noXI dont think so.
You see, Aunt Pollys awfully particular about this fence.
I guess there isnt one boy in a thousand that can do it the way its got to be done.
Oh, come on, lemme try.
Ben, Id like to, honest, butX
Oh, Ill be careful.
Say, Ill give you the core of my apple.
No, Ben, Im afraidX
Ill give you all of it!
Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face but eagerness in his heart.
And while the late steamboat worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade, dangled his legs, ate his apple, and planned how he would trick more of the boys.
There was no lack of victims: boys walked along every little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash.
By the time Ben was tired out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, and when he was worn out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it withXand so on, and so on, hour after hour.
And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was rolling in wealth.
He had, besides the things mentioned, twelve marbles, a piece of blue bottle-glass, a key that wouldnt unlock anything, a piece of chalk, a toy soldier, six firecrackers, a kitten with only one eye, a doorknob, a rusty knife, four pieces of orange peel, and an old window frame.
He had had a nice idle time all the whileXand plenty of companyXand the fence had three coats of whitewash on it!
If he hadnt run out of whitewash, he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.
Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all.
He had discovered a great law of human action: in order to make a man covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.
