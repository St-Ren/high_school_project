Bite into a big red apple, and the flavor will explode in your mouth.
Crisp , juicy, sweet and tart at the same timeXyou recognize it at once.
Without flavor like this, food would be boring indeed.
This is why hundreds of years ago, Christopher Columbus and other explorers sailed across the seas to find spices to season their food.
Everyone has his or her favorite flavors: the sunny flavor of fresh-squeezed orange juice, the rich flavor of chocolate, the salty taste of potato chips, the spicy flavor of a bowl of chili, just to name a few.
Flavor has always been important to people.
Scientists used to think that basic tastes were perceived in separate areas of the tongueXsweet at the tip, salty at the sides, and so on.
They now know that this is not trueXeach taste bud can sense all the basic tastes but reacts differently to each one.
However, taste may be stronger in one part of the tongue than in another.
Besides, the sense of taste can vary a great deal from one person to another.
Some people have more taste buds than othersXand thus they have a more sensitive sense of taste.
Research has also turned up some other interesting facts about taste and flavor.
For example, it is unlikely that you will ever lose your sense of taste.
The body is constantly replacing the receptors in the taste buds.
In fact, the average receptor is in use only ten or eleven days before a new one develops to take its place.
Thus, unlike sight or hearing, the sense of taste stays sharp well into old age.
Older people sometimes say that their food does not taste as good as it used to, but this is rarely because the sense of taste has become weak.
Instead, the other senses involved in the full experience of flavorXespecially the sense of smellXmay not be as strong as they once were.
Actually, the ability to recognize the basic tastes is present at birth, and so are certain taste preferences.
For example, newborn babies like sweet things and do not like bitter things.
Most people also naturally like salty tastes.
In fact, there are sound reasons for what people like and do not like, according to scientists.
Sweet foods generally contain sugars that the body can use to produce energy, and salt is necessary for many body functions.
But many poisonous plants taste bitter.
Thousands of years ago, when people gathered their food from the wild, a natural love of salt and sugar and a natural dislike of bitter flavors helped them survive.
On the other hand, people usually like flavors they grew up with and distrust new ones.
For example, dishes that are seasoned with hot peppers and other spices are popular in Latin America and some other regions.
Very young children do not eat them, but at the age of about 5 or 6, they start to follow their parents and enjoy these spicy foods.
However, in many northern countries, even adults rarely experience hot, spicy foods.
While people stay with flavors they know, things do change.
For example, recently, spicier and fuller flavors have become popular.
So this is what taste is all about.
Next time when you taste anything, delicious or strange, do not forget to make good use of the gifts from GodXtaste budsXand enjoy all kinds of flavors.
