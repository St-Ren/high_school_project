The View from the Window.
Two men occupied the same hospital room.
One man had to sit up in his bed for an hour a day to drain the fluids from his lungs.
His bed was by the window in the room.
The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back.
His bed was the one by the door.
With nothing else to do, the men got to know each other.
They talked for hours on end.
They spoke of their wives, families, homes, jobs, and even where they'd last been on vacation.
Every afternoon a nurse would help the man by the window sit up.
This man would pass the whole hour by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window.
The man in the other bed lived for those one-hour periods.
His roommate told him that the window overlooked a park with a lovely lake.
He described the ducks and swans that swam on the lake.
He talked about the smiling children who sailed brightly colored toy boats.
He told of lovers walking arm in arm amid flowers of every color of the rainbow.
A breathtaking view of the city could also be seen in the distance.
As the man by the window described all this in exquisite detail, the man on the other side of the room would imagine the picturesque scenes.
One warm afternoon, the man by the window described a parade passing by.
Although the other man couldn't hear the band, he could see it in his mind's eye as the man by the window portrayed it with evocative words.
Unexpectedly, an alien thought entered his head: "Why should he have all the pleasure of seeing everything?
I never get to see anything.
It isn't fair."
The man felt ashamed at first but as the days passed, his envy grew into resentment.
He began to brood and found himself unable to sleep.
He should be by that window.
This thought began to control his life.
Late one night, the man by the window began to cough.
He was choking on the fluid in his lungs.
The other man listened as the struggling man tried to reach the button to call for help.
The man by the door never pushed his own button, which would have brought the nurse running.
After five minutes, the coughing and choking stopped.
There was deathly silence.
The following morning, the nurse arrived.
She found the lifeless body.
She was visibly saddened.
The body was taken away.
As soon as he found the timing appropriate, the man asked if he could be moved next to the window.
The nurse was happy to make the switch.
After making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone.
He propped himself up slowly and painfully on one elbow to take his first look.
Finally, he would have the joy of seeing it all himself.
He strained to slowly turn and look out of the window beside the bed.
He faced a blank wall.
