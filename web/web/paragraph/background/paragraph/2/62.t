Apollo and Daphne.
Cupid was playing with his bow and arrows under a tree one day when Apollo rode by on his golden chariot.
Apollo made fun of the boy, saying, Do not play with weapons, Cupid.
They are not for a child like you! His words outraged Cupid, who thought, I am a great archer whose arrows never miss.
How could he insult me like this Cupid then decided to take revenge on Apollo by playing a trick on him.
He took out two arrows, one made of gold to trigger love, and the other made of lead to repel love.
Lets wait and see, Cupid said to himself.
Apollos arrows may strike whatever he aims at, but mine will get him!
Before long, Cupid found Apollo walking alone in the woods and hit him with his golden arrow.
At that time, Daphne, daughter of the river god Peneus, happened to be passing by, and Apollo immediately fell in love with her.
Daphne was as independent as she was beautiful, so she had vowed to remain unmarried.
Cupid, not missing this great chance, took out his leaden arrow, aimed at Daphne, and shot it.
Under the spell of the golden arrow, Apollo followed Daphne, trying to talk to her.
However, when Daphne saw him, she was startled, and she fled as fast as the wind.
Do not run away from me like a sheep from a wolf! Apollo called after her, It is for love that I pursue you.
You make me miserable for fear that you should fall and hurt yourself!
Please slow down and wait for me! Daphne would not listen; she went on running.
Yet, to Apollo, even when Daphne was running in panic she still seemed charming!
Wait, my love!
I am no rude man but Apollo, god of the sun, music, and poetry.
I am falling in love with you!
Daphne was an excellent runner, but Apollo was a powerful god.
He kept behind her and steadily got closer and closer.
When Daphnes strength began to fail, her panic was intensified by the feel of Apollos breath upon her neck.
She called out to the river in front of her, Father, help me!
Save me from this danger! Suddenly a sense of numbness came over her, and her feet seemed to be rooted in the earth.
Bark began to enclose her body, and leaves sprouted from her arms.
She had changed into a beautiful laurel tree.
Apollo was shocked and heartbroken.
He held the laurel tree, which still shuddered at his touch, in his arms, whispering, You will be my tree.
I will wear your leaves for my crown.
Victors and poets will wear your leaves, too.
You will be blessed with eternal life.
