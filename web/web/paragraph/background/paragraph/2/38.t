Hummingbirds, also called hummers, are named for the sound produced by their rapidly moving wings.
When early Spanish explorers in the Americas saw hummingbirds for the first time, they called them "flying jewels."
Most hummingbirds have colorful feathers, with males' colors being brighter than those of females.
Today these tiny birds, with their brilliant colors and lightning-fast movements, still capture people's imaginations.
Male hummingbirds are the smallest warm-blooded animals on earth.
Among them, the Bee Hummingbird is the smallest.
Its average weight is 1. grams.
So small is this bird that it can be hard to spot.
But if you do see one, you will notice its long, slender beak and rainbow-like colors.
As tiny as hummers are, their flying abilities set them apart from all the other birds.
Hummers normally fly at a speed of 2 to 3 miles per hour, and they can dive at around 6 miles per hour!
It was reported that one hummingbird kept up with a car going 5- miles per hour.
What's still more amazing is that hummingbirds can fly forward, backward or upside down, and can even hover in mid-air.
The ability to hover allows the birds to stay over a flower long enough to suck out all the nectar they need.
In normal flight, a hummer's wings beat about 1- times per second, depending on the size of the bird.
This movement burns a lot of energy; therefore, the birds need to eat every 1- minutes.
One bird may drink from 1, flowers and eat between 4 and 5 insects in a single day.
Without enough food, hummingbirds can starve to death in an hour.
Hummingbirds live only in the Americas, spending most of their time in the warmer climates.
They seem to be able to detect the changes in the length of days as well as the changes in the insect and flower populations.
Before winter comes, they migrate to avoid the cold and find enough food.
In spring they start journeying back to their birthplace to breed.
The males generally fly home about three weeks earlier than the females.
Researchers believe that some hummingbirds fly non-stop over the Gulf of Mexico.
This unbelievable 5-mile flight takes more than 1 hours!
As for distance, the Rufous Hummingbird migrates the longest distance, from Mexico to Alaska and back, a total of 1, miles.
You probably won't have the chance to see any hummingbirds in Taiwan, but if you go to the Americas, you might have a chance to catch a glimpse of these sparkling little flying jewels!
