A quiet street, a blank wall, a can of spray paint-- and a young person goes to work writing graffiti.
The term graffiti means words or drawings scratched or painted on a wall.
The word comes from the Greek term graphein, which means "to write."
People have been writing graffiti on walls for thousands of years, but today some people believe that certain types of graffiti have evolved into a genuine art form.
Many of the oldest existing examples of graffiti are from the ancient city of Pompeii on the western coast of Italy.
In the year 79, Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.
Ash from the volcano buried the city, preserving much of it for us to see today.
Carved on the walls of Pompeii are many examples of graffiti.
Some are declarations of love, while others are insults.
Some are complaints about store owners who were cheating their customers, while others are political statements or rough drawings of people.
Although the messages differ, all these examples of graffiti have one important thing in common: they were all made without the permission of the owner of the wall.
For historians, however, the graffiti represents one of the few available sources of information about the lives of the average people of Pompeii and their everyday concerns.
The purpose of graffiti art is self-expression and creativity.
According to one graffiti artist, "Creating graffiti is an art, and just like any other art, it requires tons of practice and work."
Today, most graffiti art is made with spray paint, although some artists also use brushes and markers.
For graffiti artists, just about anything can serve as a surface for their artwork, even rocks, roads, and billboards.
Of course not everyone likes or approves of graffiti on city walls.
In fact, most people think of creating graffiti as vandalism rather than art.
For the majority of people, doing graffiti without someone's permission is not freedom of expression; it is arrogance.
And the presence of graffiti in their neighborhoods makes many people feel less safe.
Seeing graffiti all around them makes many people feel that danger is just around the corner.
In the 1980s, many cities started taking action against graffiti.
The city of New York, for example, started a campaign to get rid of graffiti on subway cars.
By painting over the graffiti soon after it was created, the city was able to discourage graffiti artists from decorating the subway cars.
Then, in 1987, a new type of paint-resistant subway car became available, making it impossible for graffiti artists to paint on the cars.
The city of Los Angeles bought several "paint stores on wheels" to combat graffiti.
These cars traveled around the city looking for graffiti and painting over it immediately.
The city's goal was to discourage graffiti artists by painting over their graffiti within twenty-four hours.
Does this mean the end of graffiti?
Not quite.
In some countries, such as Japan, England, and the United States, graffiti artists are allowed to do their work on specially designated walls in a city.
Graffiti art is shown in museums, and in Australia, well-known companies sponsor graffiti competitions.
There are also hundreds of websites that feature graffiti art, as well as many books and instructional videos.
And of course, there are still people who will try to leave their mark on someone else's wall.
