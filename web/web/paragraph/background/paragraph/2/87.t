There was a time in my childhood when I believed that God was punishing my family by making us watch my only brother die.
My brother Brad was a hemophiliac.
Even though Brad couldn't be as active as other kids because of the hemophilia, we had many common interests and spent a lot of time together.
When the neighborhood kids played football or baseball, Brad would throw the ball, and the rest of us would do all the rough playing.
Even though he appeared to be inferior, he was really an inspiration to us.
However, when Brad was ten, as part of his hemophilia treatment, he received blood from someone who didn't realize, or was too selfish to admit, that he or she was carrying HIV, the AIDS virus.
Therefore, he became
infected with the terrible disease.
I had just entered the sixth grade when my brother began to have serious symptoms and was diagnosed with AIDS.
Our lives changed when Brad's symptoms became apparent.
I couldn't have friends over to spend the night.
Often, both my parents would need to be with
Brad during the times he was in the hospital.
It was difficult for me because sometimes they
were gone for a week at a time while I stayed
at a neighbor's or an aunt's house.
knew where I'd be from one day to the next.
Through all the sadness and confusion, I grew bitter about not being able to lead a normal life.
I began having problems in school.
I became very angry and felt desperate.
I needed to blame someone, so I turned my blame toward God.
Eventually, the AIDS virus caused damage to Brad's brain.
He became like a very young child again.
He wanted us to read children's books to him.
He wanted me to help him color.
I felt as if I had lost my brother while he was still alive.
Two weeks before his eighteenth birthday, Brad died.
Since his passing, I've searched for some reason for his life and death.
Although there may not be a complete answer to my question, I am sincere in my belief that there was a purpose.
Brad was a person who always fought for what he believed in.
He never gave up, and he never gave in to his hemophilia.
He would play basketball with the heart of Larry Bird, but the body of a hemophiliac.
Those who watched him play for his elementary school team would see him limping up and down the court, trying his hardest.
Out of respect for his memory, we have not given up.
My family and I have taken part in helping to make a difference in the way that people with hemophilia and AIDS are treated.
We have been interviewed on television.
We have been twice to Washington, D.C., our nation's capital, fighting for a law to be passed by Congress.
This law would help families who have been through similar or worse tragedies.
Since Brad's death, I've come to realize that God was not punishing my family for anything.
He simply had given us a gift of love-my brother, Brad-that had to be taken back.
With these lessons from God, I can continue my life with the hope that everyone with whom I share Brad's story will learn exactly how precious life is.
