M-E-M-O: Four Tips for a Better Memory.
"Memorize these words."
"Learn this spelling rule."
"Don't forget the quiz tomorrow."
You have to remember things every day, but how do you do it?
You find a telephone number in the phone book, dial it, and then quickly forget it.
This is your short-term memory at work.
It lasts less than thirty seconds.
However, you don't need to look up your best friend's number in the phone book because you already know it.
This is because the information is stored in your long-term memory.
Have you ever wondered why you forget things easily?
Do you find it difficult to learn new information by heart?
The following tips will help you to improve your memory:
Make sense
It is easier to remember information if you understand it.
Textbook units should not be read like chapters in a novel.
When you read a lesson, skim through all the headings first to get the main ideas.
Next ask yourself questions by adding words such as "who," "what," "where," "when," "why" or "how" to the headings to get the big picture.
Then try to put the information together in your own words.
Experience
One way to remember is by forming associations, that is, by using your senses or physical movements to link up a new fact with information you already have learned.
Take the words moo, coo, and quack for example.
You might associate these words with the sounds cows, birds, and ducks make.
You can also relate the idioms thumbs up and thumbs down to the gestures showing approval and disapproval.
Mnemonics: Memory Cues
When you need to remember a group of terms, use the first letter of each to create a word or a phrase.
This helps you find the right path when you are lost and cannot remember.
For example, to remember a list of North African countries (Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya), you can take the first letter of each country's name and form the acronym METAL.
You could add a recall helper with a picture and/or sentence in mind: Explorers found precious METAL in North Africa.
After you learn something, study it some more.
For example, you might end your study session by reciting all of the questions and answers you created for yourself previously.
Repeat the process periodically.
Only by reviewing in small doses-- five to ten minutes at a time-- can you learn efficiently.
Try to relax when you study.
You cannot remember things when you are tired or unhappy.
As a student, it is almost impossible to learn every detail in your textbook and notebook.
Keep the above "M-E-M-O" tips in mind.
Select the key information and figure out for yourself the best way to improve your memory.
This way, you'll never be regarded as a forgetful person!
