Have you ever felt that it is really hard to communicate with friends and companions of the opposite sex?
Actually, most misunderstandings between men and women stem from different conversational styles.
According to the book You Just Don't Understand-Women and Men in Conversation, the language women use is quite different from that used by men because they take different approaches to communication.
The following are examples of the most common conflicts between males and females.
Ruling vs.
Negotiation
While in their car, a girl turned to her boyfriend and asked, "Would you like to stop for a coffee?"
"No, thanks," he answered.
So they didn't stop.
The result?
The girl, who had wanted to stop, became annoyed.
But the boy felt frustrated because his girlfriend hadn't said what she wanted.
In fact, the girl was asking the question not to get an instant decision, but to begin a negotiation.
She didn't realize that when her boyfriend said no, he was just expressing his preference, not making a ruling.
Advice vs. Understanding
When Eve confided to her boyfriend, Mark, that she was distressed because she was fat, Mark answered, "You should go on a diet."
The comment bothered her.
"I know you think I am fat, but I am not going on a diet."
Eve thought Mark was advising her to lose weight because he agreed with the statement that she was fat.
Mark was hurt and puzzled.
"I don't care how much she weighs.
It doesn't bother me at all."
To many men, a complaint means a challenge to come up with a solution.
But often women are looking for emotional support instead of solutions.
In this case, all Eve wanted was sympathy, not advice.
Independence vs. Intimacy
On Josh's way to meet Linda for dinner, he ran across his best friend Brian.
He invited Brian to have dinner with them.
When both Josh and Brian showed up together at the restaurant, Linda felt upset because Josh had made the decision without checking with her first.
Linda always checked with Josh first before she made a decision, which showed that her life was intertwined with his.
Josh, however, did not want to ask his girlfriend for permission just to invite a friend to dinner.
He felt he would be losing his freedom to act on his own.
What caused the conflict?
Women place more emphasis on closeness and giving support whereas men tend to focus more on independence.
If we can't see that the two sexes have different communication styles, we may sometimes draw unfair conclusions: "You're self-centered," or "You don't care about me."
But when we learn the opposite sex's ways of talking, we can bridge the communication gap and take a giant step toward genuine understanding.
