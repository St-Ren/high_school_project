On July 20, 1969, Buzz Aldrin was one of the first men to take a step on the moon.
On March 28, 2007, he was the first to step on the Skywalk at the Grand Canyon West in the U.S. state of Arizona.
Speaking to a packed crowd of media and VIP guests, Aldrin said, It was not quite like walking on air, but a wonderful vision and a vision of hope for the future.
The vision can be traced back to 1996.
David Jin, a Las Vegas businessman from Shanghai, China, approached the Hualapai tribe, the Indians who own the Grand Canyon West, with a plan to build a skywalk with his own money.
Jin said he thought it would be really amazing to be able to walk out over the canyon.
Construction began in March 2004 and the Skywalk was finally rolled to the edge of the canyon on March 7, 2007 after passing several days of testing.
The completed Skywalk is truly amazing.
It hangs 1,200 meters above the floor of the canyon, giving visitors a view from more than twice as high as Taipei 101.
It projects 20 meters beyond the
edge of the canyon.
With its walls and floor
built from glass 10.2 centimeters thick, the
Skywalk is capable of holding 70 tons of weight (about 800
people weighing 80 kilograms each); however, no more than
120 people can be on it at one time.
Visitors are provided
with shoe covers to protect them from slipping and to
prevent the glass floor from being damaged.
The construction of the Skywalk alone cost more
than US$40 million.
Under Jins plan, the Hualapai tribe
owns the Skywalk, but he collects up to half of the money
from ticket sales for the next 25 years.
Future plans for
the Grand Canyon Skywalk include a visitors center,
museum, movie theater, gift shop, and several restaurants,
including an expensive restaurant called The Skywalk Caf?,
where visitors will be able to eat outside.
However, the planning and construction of the Skywalk has caused controversy within the Hualapai tribe as well as between the tribe and outside groups.
Opponents within the tribe view the project as disturbing sacred  ground.
The Hualapai believe their ancestors emerged from the earth of the Grand Canyon, and many of the tribes sacred sites for the dead are in the area.
People outside of the tribe, including Arizona environmental groups and former National Park officials, have complained the Skywalk takes away the natural beauty of the environment.
Some have suggested it is ironic that the Hualapai had argued they took good care of the Grand Canyon, and yet decided to use it in this way.
The tribe leaders argue that it is an opportunity to generate much-needed
cash to combat serious problems in this area, including a 50 percent unemployment rate, alcohol abuse, and poverty.
As for the environmental concerns, they argue that the Grand Canyon National Park is already polluted by the 4.5 million people a year.
In addition, the Hualapai are completely dependent on the visitors who come to the reservation each year.
With the construction of the Skywalk, their reservation can attract more tourists and the income can solve their problems.
Is the Skywalk helping get the Hualapai out of their financial troubles?
Since the opening of the Skywalk, Grand Canyon West has been experiencing a record number of 3,000 visitors every day.
So, like it or not, the Skywalk is definitely a money-maker.
