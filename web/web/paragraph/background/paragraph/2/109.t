Unit 4  The Magic Bean.
Centuries ago, a brilliant Muslim physician whose name was Omar devoted himself to treating patients.
All was well until a strange disease became an epidemic among the inhabitants of Mocha.
The beautiful princess of Mocha also fell ill, and her health declined rather rapidly.
Desperate with worry, the king summoned Omar to save his daughter.
Omar hurried to the palace and was led to the princesss chamber.
Please save her life at all costs, the king implored.
With a heart of gold, Omar nodded and began to treat the princess for this life-threatening disease.
He stayed at her side all day and through the night.
To everyones joy and relief, the princess quickly recovered from the illness the next morning.
At first, the king was pleased with his daughters miraculous recovery.
However, it was considered improper for a man to have stayed in the princesss chamber throughout the night.
As rumors about Omar began to go around, the king raged at the physician, Had you not saved my daughters life, I would have executed you.
From now on, you will be exiled from my kingdom for good.
Omar, obeying the kings order, left Mocha with bitter disappointment and embarked on a journey to a place he had never been to.
There, he lived a life of a tramp and wandered the wilderness.
One day, Omar was unable to find any food.
Hungry and exhausted, he collapsed under a tree.
Will I starve to death today he asked himself.
Then, something caught his eyeXa weak bird was eating some beans.
To Omars astonishment, the bird soon looked energetic and began to chirp loudly.
Out of curiosity, Omar collected some of the beans, boiled them to make a thick, sticky liquid, and then drank it.
Within minutes, his energy was restored.
The experience was so encouraging that he decided to use the magic bean as a type of medicine.
As time passed, Omar still wandered alone, remaining exiled and forgotten.
Only when another epidemic hit Mocha did his name occur to the people again.
This time, another strange disease, which caused the body to throb and itch, was quickly spreading.
The people of Mocha, in their suffering, recalled Omars good deeds and his extraordinary medical skill.
Seeking out Omar was their last hope.
When they finally found him, he had them drink the liquid made from this magic bean.
Miraculously, all of the sick people who consumed the drink recovered from the disease.
When the king heard about how Omar had helped his people, he regretted his decision to force the great physician to leave his land.
Therefore, he sent word that Omar was no longer in exile.
Amid cheers and applause, Omar returned to Mocha as a hero.
This is how the magic bean, or the coffee bean as we call it today, is said to have been discovered.
Today, this bean is used to make one of the worlds most popular drinks.
As for Omar, he is revered as a saint by coffee growers and coffee shop owners near Mocha.
