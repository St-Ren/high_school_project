Unit 2  Traffic Lights for Food.
Recent studies have shown that being obese can pose a serious threat to our health.
Obesity may lead to heart disease, diabetes, various types of cancer, and other disturbing health problems.
To prevent any of these illnesses, it is vital that we control our weight.
Exercise, without a doubt, is a good way to keep in shape.
Calculating our BMI is another way to roughly determine whether we are maintaining our ideal weight or not.
However, no matter what method we apply, we should first and foremost watch our diet.
Our diet matters because what we eat has a lot to do with our weight and can directly affect our health.
Thus, it is critical that we keep off any foods that are potentially damaging to our health.
Many of us sometimes absorb excessive numbers of certain nutrients, such as fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt, and we can risk our health unknowingly.
Therefore, the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom has come up with an idea called traffic light labeling.
This system labels potentially risky nutrients with something we are familiar with: the lights at the intersection that tell both drivers and pedestrians when to go, to be cautious, or to stop.
Traffic light labeling is easy to understand.
Green, amber, and red respectively represent low, medium, and high amounts of fat, saturated fat, sugar, and salt in one serving.
Basically, the more green lights we see on a package of food, the healthier that food is.
Red lights warn consumers that the food product should only be eaten from time to time or in small amounts.
The middle of the two extremes is amber.
Amber lights mean that the amount of fat, saturated fat, sugar, or salt that the food contains is not too high.
However, the color also implies that the food is not low in those nutrients.
This is something that the consumers should be aware of, too.
This system has several advantages.
One is that consumers can know if the food they are buying might possibly cause obesity-related diseases at a glance because the symbols that this system uses are instantly recognizable, even to children.
Furthermore, it can be universally applied without worries about the language barrier.
Currently, aside from the U.K., Germany and Sweden have introduced this system.
Nevertheless, there is opposition to this idea.
People in the food industry complain that this approach to food labeling is too simplistic.
To them, giving exact figures to indicate nutrition facts for one serving is preferable.
Advocates of traffic light labels for food counter this argument by saying that being simple is the virtue of this system.
It makes finding information about food easy and obvious, lest consumers ignore the information just because reading nutrition facts takes time.
In spite of the fact that not everyone supports traffic light labeling, this system does convey some important messages: People should make better food choices, and healthy products should be encouraged.
There are times when we are not sure if the food we buy might do harm to our health.
With traffic light labels on the package of a food product, we can pause for thought, consider what we should choose, and then decide which items we should put in our shopping baskets.
After all, we are what we eat.
