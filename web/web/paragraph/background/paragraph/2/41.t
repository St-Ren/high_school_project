When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you
If your heart is in your dreams
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dream comes true
"When You Wish upon a Star" is a popular song that was introduced in the 1 Disney movie Pinocchio.
It has been used in Disney Pictures' opening logos and in many parades at Disney theme parks.
The iconic first seven notes of the song's melody are familiar to kids and adults alike.
The song conveys an important lesson that the little wooden boy, Pinocchio, learned from life.
"If your heart is in your dreams, no request is too extreme."
Having true love for his father, Pinocchio plucked up the courage to save him from the whale.
His prayer was finally answered as his faith and bravery qualified him to become a real boy.
These lyrics are, in a sense, also autobiographical.
They tell of Disney's own positive, cheerful approach to life, and encourage all of us to pursue our dreams.
Born into a farmhand's family, Walt Disney didn't have much opportunity to receive a good education.
In fact, he only finished one year of high school.
Yet a combination of events, along with his personality, turned him into one of the most inspiring men of the twentieth century.
At twenty-two, Disney started his cartoon career in a small studio in California.
Though working in poverty and hardship, he remained convinced that his hard work would pay off.
One day, a flash of inspiration came to Disney.
He created a cheerful little mouse, later known as Mickey Mouse, which rescued his faltering career and helped him build his entire fantasy kingdom.
It is a kingdom which has been weaving dreams for countless people ever since.
In his later animations, Disney delivered the same simple message to dreamers again and again.
He kept encouraging them to spring into action.
For example, Aladdin, a street urchin, felt trapped in a life of poverty.
Poor as he was, he managed to overcome many obstacles in his pursuit of happiness.
Likewise, Mulan used her wits to save her country and prove herself despite the disadvantages of being a woman, especially in a traditional Eastern culture.
As long as one has love and is determined to achieve his or her goal, fate will do its part and work miracles.
In his life and work, Disney knew what it meant to wish upon a star.
He dared to dream and to make those dreams come true-for himself and for millions of imaginative souls around the world.
