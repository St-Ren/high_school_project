Unit 10  Death by Tourism.
At the entrance to one of the temples of Petra in Jordan, something is carved deeply into the soft red rock.
At first glance, it looks like it has been there for centuries.
It could have been written by King Herods soldiers, when they were confined here in 40 B.C.
But closer inspection reveals that it is not so ancient after all.
Shane and Wendy from Sydney were here.
April 16th 1996.
The ruins of Petra were discovered in 1812, and a recent report has just concluded that they are in grave danger of being destroyed by the unstoppable march of tourism. More than four thousand tourists a day tramp through Petras rocky tombs.
They wear away the delicate red sandstone and occasionally scratch their names on the rock.
However, it is not just Petra that is under threat of destruction.
More than 600 million tourists a year now travel the globe, and huge numbers of them want to visit the worlds most treasured sites: the Taj Mahal, Stonehenge, the national parks of Kenya, and so on.
Many destinations that used to be remote are now part of package tours.
Because of the growing global tourist industry, these sites are now being visited by millions of people every year.
Tourists are flocking to the neighborhood of the Mediterranean, too.
Its population of 130 million can increase and amount to 230 million each summer.
The once untouched landscape there now consists of mile after mile of hotels.
Whats more, the United Nations predicted that visitors to the region could number 760 million by 2025.
In Spain, France, Italy, and most of Greece, there is very little undeveloped coastline left, and the Mediterranean has become the dirtiest sea in the whole world.
Not all of the news is depressing, though.
Some governments are becoming more aware of the damage of these valuable areas, and are taking action.
For example, the Fushan Botanical Garden in Taiwan has been established to protect part of the islands natural environment.
Unlike tourist spots, this reservation preserves the areas natural environment by limiting the number of visitors to just six hundred during the weekends.
Visitors are also required to apply in advance for a special entry permit.
Additionally, visitors are kept out of certain sections of the park so that the animals and plants there remain undisturbed.
Moreover, an education center has been built to teach visitors to have greater respect for the natural environment.
These measures have raised the number of plants and animals in and around the reservation.
There was no doubt that travel opens peoples eyes, but how can this possibly be true if the explosive growth of tourism eventually leaves nothing but ruins for visitors to see?
If uncontrolled, tourism will continue to take its toll on cultural and natural treasures, and these precious things cannot be restored once they have been spoiled.
To prevent further destruction, it is important that governments lay down clear guiding principles to encourage more public participation in environmental conservation.
Tourists, too, must act with a stronger sense of responsibility and morality than they do now.
After all, visiting these unique and amazing places around the world is a privilege, rather than something that is taken for granted.
