Unit 5  The Journey Ahead.
I was twenty-five when I was arrested for stealing a loaf of bread to feed my starving family.
For that petty crime, I spent nineteen years in prison.
When I was released from prison, I was a bitter man.
I walked for miles, trying to find an inn to rest in.
By the time I arrived at the town of Digne, the sun had already set, and I felt hungry and suffered from fatigue.
When I was seeking accommodation for the night at an inn, the owner of the inn didnt seem to like my appearance.
He sent a boy to the police station to make inquiries about me.
When the boy returned, he handed the owner a note.
From the note, the owner learned that my name was Jean Valjean and that I was an ex-convict.
As a result, he refused to offer me a room.
Soon, everyone in Digne knew my identity.
Consequently, no one wanted to reach out to me, and even a glass of water was too much for me to ask for.
Cold and starving, I was left to shiver in the dark.
Fortunately, the bishop of Digne, a very generous man, took pity on me and welcomed me with open arms.
After hearing my story, he didnt drive me out of his home as most others had done.
Instead, he invited me to stay and dine with him.
No one had ever been so nice to me.
I should have been grateful to the bishop for his great kindness, yet I was deeply disturbed.
That night, though I was lucky enough to sleep in bed for the first time in nineteen years, I couldnt fall asleep.
I kept thinking about the silverware and the candlesticks on the bishops dinner table.
Then I got up, stole the silverware, and slipped away.
However, I didnt get far.
By the time it was dawn, the police had caught me and taken me back to the bishop.
Im delighted to see you again! the bishop spoke to me before I had a chance to say anything.
You forgot to take the candlesticks.
I was stunned by his wordshe had not only forgiven me for my crime but also wanted me to have his only treasured possession.
After the police left, the bishop said, I have bought your soul for God.
Promise me you will use the money from these things wisely and become an honest man.
I left the bishops house and wandered around the countryside.
My thoughts were on my dreadful days in prison and on my wasted life.
I was upset and angry.
As I brooded over my misery, a boy turned up.
He was walking toward me, flipping a coin.
Then, the boy accidentally dropped his franc just as he passed by.
As soon as I saw the coin, I stepped on it and refused to move.
Monsieur, my franc! cried the boy.
I yelled at him, and he quickly ran away with a look of terror on his face.
Later when I moved my foot, as though having woken from a nightmare, I realized what I had done: I had stolen from a child simply out of habit!
The bishops words flashed through my mind.
With flames of regret burning deep inside of me, I couldnt help but weep and pray for forgiveness.
I eagerly searched everywhere for the boy, but my efforts were in vain.
Though I could not return the franc and put things right, my anger and bitterness had somehow vanished.
The bishops love had allowed me to cast out my hatred for the world.
From that moment on, I was truly free.
I, Jean Valjean, was a changed man, a man who has never committed another crime.
