Unit 11  Lets Be Diverse.
It is said that if bees become extinct, humans will have no more than four years to live.
Stunning as the prediction may seem, it is highly probable.
Bees, which qualify as the best pollinators in nature, carry pollen from one plant to another during their daily search for food.
Were it not for bees, most plants would not be able to be fertilized and reproduce, nor would humans be able to use these plants for food, clothing, medicine, and fuel.
If bees became extinct, crop yields would fall.
Next, food shortages would surely arise.
It is no exaggeration to say that bees are vital to human survival.
The bad news is that there has been a steep decline in the bee population since the 1970s.
Human activity has destroyed the natural habitats of many animals and plants, one of which is the natural habitat of bees.
Agricultural practices, especially the use of insecticides, are one of the contributing factors in the destruction.
To solve this crisis, some people have suggested artificial pollination.
It sounds feasible in some ways; however, little do they know that a worker bee can fly among at least 5,000 flowers a day, with more than ten thousand pollen grains attached to its body hair.
So quickly do worker bees pollinate plants that science and technology alone cant compare.
Whats worse is that most people are not alert to the even bigger crisis behind the phenomenon of the declining bee populationXthat is, a severe ecological imbalance.
All species on Earth, including animals, plants, and microorganisms, have important roles to play.
Various species, together with the environment they live in, form an ecosystem.
The variety of life within a particular ecosystem, such as a rain forest, a desert, or even the entire Earth, is referred to as biodiversity.
Healthy biodiversity can ensure a balanced ecosystem and the survival of all the species within.
Nevertheless, over the centuries, humans have caused the Earths biodiversity to drop to such an extent that it can never be recovered.
Why is it important to conserve biodiversity?
One reason is that genetic diversity is closely related to biodiversity.
The poorer the biodiversity is in an ecosystem, the smaller the gene pool will be.
In other words, poor biodiversity will lead to low genetic diversity and reduce the biological fitness of a species, thus bringing about a greater chance of extinction.
Unfortunately, humans have long gotten used to planting only one staple crop in an area, which causes the loss of local biodiversity.
The Great Famine in Ireland in the 19th century is a classic example.
Because of potato blight, the locals had a very bad harvest of the potato species that they had lived on.
The famine took around one million Irish lives and forced another million to emigrate.
Had the Irish introduced other potato species that were resistant to this disease, the disaster would have been much less grave.
It is apparent that biodiversity is of great importance to all biological species.
If the loss of biodiversity continues, humans will certainly suffer the consequences of it in the future.
In the long term, trying to survive would be a difficult task for all of the species in the world, including humankind, not to mention the possibility of flourishing.
Therefore, conserving the endangered species is not simply about saving beautiful plants and animals.
It is actually about saving ourselves and our descendants alike.
