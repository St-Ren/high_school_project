How to Make an Effective Speech.
Half the world is composed of people who have something to say and cant; the other half have nothing to say and keep saying it.
Whoever wants to be a good speaker needs to know how to express himself or herself well.
Are you interested in making an effective speech?
If the answer is yes, there are five elements you should consider.
Be Prepared.
Being prepared is by far the most important element.
How many times do you practice your speech?
As a general rule, you should spend about thirty hours of preparation and rehearsal time for every hour you will be speaking.
Use a tape recorder or videotape yourself.
This will help you to get an accurate picture of how you speak.
Give of Yourself.
Look for opportunities to use personal examples and stories in your speech.
Make sure your stories help to emphasize or support your point.
The stories must match your message.
Use examples from your personal and/or professional life to make your point.
In either case, be willing to give of yourself by sharing some of yourself with the audience.
Stay Relaxed.
To stay relaxed you should be prepared.
Also, focus on your message and not the audience.
Use gestures, including walking patterns.
Practice the opening of your speech and plan exactly how you will say it.
The audience will judge you in the first thirty seconds they see you.
Use Natural Humor.
Dont try to be a stand-up comedian.
Use natural humor by poking fun at yourselfXsomething you said or did.
Be sure NOT to make fun of anyone in the audience.
People will laugh with you when you poke fun at yourself, but dont overdo it.
Plan Your Body and Hand Positions.
As you practice your speech, look for occasions when you can use a gesture.
Establish three positions where you will stand; then decide how and at what points in your speech you will move.
Pick one position on center stage, one to your right, and one to your left.
Do not hide behind the lectern.
When you do move, maintain eye contact with the audience.
The key point to remember in giving an effective speech is to start preparing for it early.
It is very important that you pay attention to even the smallest details.
You can never overplan.
As the saying goes, He who fails to plan is planning for failure.
