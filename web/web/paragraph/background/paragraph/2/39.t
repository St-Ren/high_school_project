Princess Atalanta was a terrific athlete in ancient Greece.
Very skillful in masculine activities, the fair young lady was an excellent runner, archer, and huntress.
Proud of their vigorous and graceful princess, everyone in the country wondered what young man could ever be a match for her.
But Atalanta did not want to give up her freedom.
She consented to marry only if a man could outrun her in a race.
Many men made the attempt but none could keep up with her.
It soon became clear that no other human being could run as fast as Atalanta.
One young man, Hippomenes, watched in awe as Atalanta won one of her races.
As she sped by, the maiden seemed as swift and graceful as a falcon.
Her dark hair rippled over her white shoulders, the colored ribbons she wore fluttered, and her face grew rose-colored during the fierce race.
Hippomenes fell deeply in love with Atalanta.
Unable to outrun the beautiful huntress, however, he prayed to Aphrodite for help.
Aphrodite, the goddess of love, heard Hippomenes and decided to help him.
She appeared to the man and gave him three apples of pure gold.
Aphrodite told him to use the golden apples in the race and then she vanished.
So Hippomenes challenged Atalanta to a race.
When Atalanta saw Hippomenes, she was struck by the beauty of his golden hair and the smoothness of his face.
For a moment, she was not sure if she must outrun this young handsome man.
Still, her desire for freedom tugged at her heart.
The race began and Atalanta immediately outpaced Hippomenes.
The young man had to toss one of the golden apples right away.
It landed near Atalanta's feet and rolled to the side of the road.
The apple diverted the princess's attention.
She stopped briefly to pick it up.
Hippomenes took the opportunity and caught up with her.
But Atalanta started running again and soon pulled ahead, so Hippomenes had to throw another apple.
Once more, Atalanta stopped to get it, and Hippomenes got ahead.
When Atalanta was back in the race, she picked up her pace and recovered the lead.
Hippomenes hurled the last apple further away from the road.
Atalanta hesitated.
The goal was now in sight, but the shining golden apple was too tempting a prize to pass up.
She decided to run to the apple and grab it.
Now Hippomenes had a bigger lead.
He was almost approaching the finish line.
His face was red with exhaustion and he was gasping for air.
Atalanta, on the other hand, was running as swiftly as an arrow shooting toward its target.
But it was too late.
Hippomenes crossed the finish line first, and he was barely one step ahead.
Atalanta lost the race.
She had to keep her promise and marry Hippomenes.
From then on, the couple were seen racing in the countryside many times.
But Hippomenes never won again.
