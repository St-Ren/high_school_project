 　　Everyone is a poet, especially when he or she is in love. In lovers’ eyes, everything about their beloved* ones is the fairest and most wonderful in the world. To praise the beauty of their love, lovers often come up with numerous poetic expressions. For example, they may compare their lovers’ eyes to the shining stars and their smiles to the winter sunshine. This kind of comparison, or figure of* speech, is often used by poets in their works. By comparing one thing to another, poets make what they want to describe more vivid and concrete to readers.  　　There are two major types of this kind of expression: similes and metaphors. Simile is from the Latin word simili, which means likeness* or similarity. It is a comparison of two different things using the words “like” or “as.” When people say, “My love is like a red, red rose,” or “Your eyes are as blue as the sky,” they are making use of similes. 　　As for the metaphor, it is a direct comparison between two different things that does not use “like” or “as.” You may have heard someone say, “You are my sunshine” or “Life is a journey”; both of these are well-known examples of metaphors. Now you are going to read two love poems that are written with similes and metaphors. Read them slowly and see how the poets use these poetic devices. My Love Is like an Ocean My love is like an ocean It goes down so deep My love is like a rose Whose beauty you want to keep. My love is like a river That will never end My love is like a dove With a beautiful message to send. My love is like a song That goes on and on forever My love is like a prisoner It’s to you that I surrender. －Rob Thompson*－ If You Were a Shining Star If you were a shining star And I were your midnight, I’d let you shine above me, You’d be my only light. If you were a scoop of ice cream And I were an ice cream cone, I’d put you on my shoulders And hold you for my own. If you were a grand piano* And I were a sweet love song, I’d let your keys tickle and tease My melody all day long. If you were the pages of my book And I were reading you, I’d read as slow as I could go So I never would get through. 
﻿　　Volunteers are caring and selfless people of all ages, genders*, occupations, and nationalities. You must have heard touching stories about the volunteers who helped victims of natural disasters. They rushed to help the victims after the 1 earthquake in Taiwan, the 2 Asian* tsunami, and the 2 earthquake in Sichuan*. 　　Yet volunteers do much more than that. Some volunteers clean up beaches and neighborhoods or take care of stray* animals. Others run errands for old people living by themselves. And still others help traffic police or firefighters on the job. There are always opportunities for caring individuals to offer their services. 　　In Taiwan, there are some well-known volunteer organizations, including Tzu Chi Foundation*, the Red Cross, World Vision*, and the Genesis Social Welfare Foundation*. These associations have millions of members who serve people in need every day. 　　The Youth Knowledge Network (YKN)* is a smaller but equally active volunteer organization mainly composed of college and high school students in Taiwan. It helps these young people learn and grow by serving in many volunteer projects. The YKN members have taught the elderly Net surfing and helped children in remote areas build up a connection with the outside world. They have studied the controversial* issue of Makau National Park* and launched the AIDS Caring Project* to protect the rights of AIDS victims. In each project, they use the Internet to exchange ideas and information with other young people around the world. 　　You may wonder why more and more people want to devote themselves to volunteer work. In fact, volunteering offers many benefits. First of all, it offers valuable job experience and skills for your future career. Volunteer work can also teach you a lot about yourself and promote your personal development. In addition, you can learn about your strengths, weaknesses, and the kind of work you like to do. You can learn how to deal with other people and build relationships. Best of all, since you know you are helping others and making a difference, volunteer work brings a deep sense of happiness. 　　Volunteers make the world a better place and make themselves better people. So if you’ve never done any kind of volunteer work, now it’s time to get started!
The Little Shepherd Boy.      Once upon a time there was a little shepherd boy. He was famous for the clever answer he could give to any question. The king of the country heard about him and sent for him in order to test the boys powers.      If you can answer my three questions, said the king, I will take you as my own child. Then you can live with me here in the palace.      As you wish, replied the boy. What are your questions?      Here is the first, said the king. How many drops of water are there in the sea?      Your Majesty, replied the boy, if you can block up all the rivers in the world so that no more water, not even a single drop, can flow into the sea, then I will tell you how many drops there are in it.      Here is the second question, said the king. How many stars are there in the sky?      Give me a big sheet of paper, said the boy. Then he took a pen and made so many dots on the paper that it was impossible to tell one dot from the next. It made the king quite dizzy just to look at it. There are as many stars in the sky as there are dots on this sheet of paper, said the boy. Count them! But no one was able to count them.       Here, then, is my third question, said the king. How many seconds are there in eternity?      Thats easy, replied the boy. There is a huge mountain called Diamond Mountain. Its twenty thousand feet high and twenty miles round. Once every hundred years a sparrow comes and sharpens its beak on this mountain. When the whole mountain has been worn away, that will be the end of the first second of eternity.      Good, said the king. You have answered my questions with the wisdom of a great scholar. You shall stay in my palace, and I will look upon you as my own child.

Interesting Experiments: Not All Bubbles Are Made with Soap. Doing chemical experiments is not as boring as many people think. In fact, it can be a lot of fun, as the following two experiments show. I. Balloon Blow-Up What Do I Need? ? A bottle with a narrow neck ? Vinegar ? Baking soda ? Funnel or straw ? Water ? Balloon    What Do I Do? 1 	Pour about an inch of liquidXhalf vinegar, half waterXinto the bottle. 2 	Use the funnel to fill the balloon half full of baking soda. (If you dont have a funnel, you can use a straw to load the balloon. Stick the straw into the baking soda, and put your finger over the top of the straw. Lift the straw out, put it into the balloon, and blow or tap gently.) 3 	Stretch the open end of the balloon over the neck of the bottle. Make sure its on tight! Let the heavy end of the balloon dangle so no baking soda goes in the bottle. 4. Hold onto the balloon at the bottle neck, and pick up the heavy part of the balloon so that all the baking soda falls into the vinegar at the bottom of the bottle. 5	Wow! Hear the fizz? There are thousands of bubbles! And look at whats happening to the balloon. II. Raisin City Music Hall What Do I Need? 	For more bubble fun youll need: ? A can of clear soda (e.g., 7-Up, ginger ale) ? Raisins What Do I Do? Get a can of clear soda and shake it as hard as you can. Knock sharply on the top two or three times. Now open it. Or give it to a grown-up to open, if you dare. Watch out! (This may be messy, so do it over the sink or outside.) What happens? What did you expect? Fantastic Feats of Fizz Now that your can of soda is open, pour it into a glass.  Drop in five or six small raisins. Watch tiny bubbles form all over them. In a minute or so, the raisins will start to wiggle around and dance. Then theyll float up to the top of the soda.  After a minute, theyll sink back down again. If you tap on the side of glass, theyll sink right away. How long will they keep dancing? adapted from The Science Explorer, Used with permission ? Exploratorium, www.exploratorium.edu 
The Luncheon. 	I met her at the play and sat down beside her. It was long since I had last seen her, and I almost didnt recognize her. 	How time flies! she said. Do you remember the first time I saw you?  You asked me to luncheon. Did I remember? 	It was twenty years ago. I was living in Paris and was earning very little money. She said she would like to have a chat with me, and asked if I would give her a little luncheon at Foyots. Well, Foyots was such an expensive restaurant that I had never thought of going there. But I was too young to have learned to say no to a woman. I had eighty francs for the month, and a simple luncheon should cost fifteen. If I cut out coffee for the next two weeks, I could manage.	 	We met at Foyots. She was charming and talkative. I was surprised when the menu was brought, for the prices were much higher than I had expected. But she reassured me.     I never eat anything for luncheon, she said. 	Oh, dont say that! I answered politely. 	I never eat more than one thing. A little fish, perhaps. I wonder if they have any salmon.	Well, salmon was not on the menu, but I asked the waiter if there was any. Yes, a beautiful salmon had just come in. I ordered it for my guest. The waiter asked if she wanted anything else. 	No, she answered. I never eat more than one thing, unless you have a little caviar. My heart sank a little: I knew I could not afford caviar, but I could not tell her that. I told the waiter to bring caviar. For myself I chose the cheapest dish on the menu, a pork chop. 	I think youre unwise to eat meat, she said. I dont believe in overloading my stomach.	Then came the question of drink. 	I never drink anything for luncheon, she said. 	Neither do I, I said quickly. 	Except white wine, she went on. Its wonderful for the digestion.	I ordered half a bottle. 	What are you going to drink? she asked. 	Water.	She ate the caviar and the salmon. She talked gaily about literature and music. I wondered about the bill. 	The waiter came again. She waved him away. 	No, no, I never eat anything for luncheon. I couldnt possibly eat anything more unless they had some of those giant asparagus. 	My heart sank lower. I knew they were horribly expensive, but I ordered some. 	Arent you going to have any?	No, I never eat asparagus.	Oh, the fact is, you ruin your sense of taste by all the meat you eat.	We waited for the asparagus. Panic seized me. I did not know whether I had enough to pay the bill. I decided if it was too much, I would jump up and say my money had been stolen. 	The asparagus looked delicious. I watched the woman eat them in large mouthfuls, and I talked politely about literature and drama. At last she finished. 	Coffee? I said. 	Yes, just an ice cream and coffee, she answered. 	I was past caring now, so I ordered coffee for myself as well. 	You know, she said, as she ate the ice cream. I believe one should always get up from a meal feeling one could eat a little more.	Are you still hungry? I asked weakly. 	Oh, no. You see, I never eat more than one thing for luncheon. I was speaking for you.	Oh, I see!	Just then, the waiter came by with a basket of huge peaches. But surely peaches were not in season then. I knew they must be extremely expensive.  My guest, going on with her conversation, took one. 	You see, youve filled your stomach with a lot of meat and you cant eat anymore. But Ive just had a snack and I shall enjoy a peach.	The bill came, and I was barely able to pay it. But when I left the restaurant I had the whole month before me and not a penny in my pocket. 	Follow my example, she said as we shook hands, and never eat more than one thing for luncheon.?	Ill do better than that, I said, Ill eat nothing for dinner tonight.	Humorist! she cried gaily, jumping into a cab. Youre quite a humorist!	But I have had my revenge at last. I am not a mean person, but I must say I was pleased when I saw her again at the play. She now weighs three hundred pounds.  
Something Old, Something New.    Although weddings vary greatly in the United States, at most American weddings, the bride follows certain traditions of dress. These traditions are often expressed in an old saying that tells women what they should wear or carry when they marry: Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue.     This good luck saying dates back to Victorian times in the 1800s, and many American brides today still try to dress according to this saying. 	Something old symbolizes the connection with the brides family and the past. Many brides wear a piece of family jewelry or a mothers or grandmothers wedding dress.                                          	Something new symbolizes good luck and success in the brides new life. The wedding dress is often the new item. However, the bride may also wear new jewelry. 	Something borrowed reminds the bride that friends and family will help her when she needs them to. The borrowed object might be something such as a lace handkerchief, or a best friends bridal veil.  	Something blue is a symbol of faithfulness and loyalty. Often the blue item is the garter worn on the brides leg. It might also be a ribbon or a piece of jewelry.  	The bride carries flowers as a symbol of happiness. At the end of the wedding reception, the bride tosses her bouquet to all the single women who are attending the party. The single woman who catches the bouquet is believed to be the next who will marry.  	Throwing the garter began in France, where pieces of the brides clothing were considered lucky. The bride would throw her garter to the guests at the wedding and whoever caught it could expect good luck. In the United States, the groom traditionally removes the garter from the brides leg and throws it to the unmarried men. The man who catches it is thought to be the next who will marry. At some weddings, the man who catches the garter will place it on the leg of the woman who caught the bouquet. It is also common for the recipients of the bouquet and garter to have their photo taken with the bride and groom. 	Whatever the bride wears, it is also traditional that she be the best-dressed woman at the wedding party. So, it is considered very impolite for other women at the wedding to dress more beautifully than the bride. 
﻿　　September 1997 marked the 100th anniversary1 of the publication2 of one of the most famous newspaper editorials3 of all time-an essay4 which was written to answer an eight-year-old girl’s question: “Is there a Santa Claus?” 　　Like many children, Virginia O’Hanlon2 of New York City believed in Santa Claus. But some friends of hers had told her that Santa did not exist5. When she asked her father, he did not give her an answer. So she told him that she was going to write to The New York Sun3, a popular newspaper of that time. Her father replied, “If you see it in The Sun, it’s so.” Virginia’s letter was answered by Francis P. Church4. Today, people think his letter is a literary6 masterpiece5. Church told her, “.... Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as surely as love and kindness7 and devotion8 exist. You know that they are plentiful9 and give to your life its highest beauty10 and joy. Alas6! The world would be terribly11 dreary7 if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as if there were no Virginias. Without Santa, life would be intolerable8; there would be no childlike9 faith12, no poetry13, no romance10. We should have no joy, except in sense and sight. The light with which childhood fills the world would turn off.” 　　“Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that does not mean there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in the world are those that cannot be seen by either children or adults. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn14? Of course not, but that’s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can imagine15 all the wonders that we don’t see and we are unable16 to see in the world.” 　　“Thank God! He lives, and he lives forever17. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay11, ten times ten thousand years from now, he’ll always make children happy.”  　　Since the editorial first appeared on September 21, 1897, it has been translated18 into many languages. Its fame19 is due to the hope it gives not only to children but to adults too.  　　The world has changed in many ways since 1897. But even today, those timeless12 words—“Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus” —still speak to people who hope that their dreams will come true.
Unit 3  Inventing a Better World.      As an old saying goes, Necessity is the mother of invention. Many times, people come up with ideas to meet their own needs. Later, the solutions to their problems may become great inventions that change our way of life. The two examples below will perfectly explain this point.      Teng Hung-chi, who is a famous Taiwanese inventor, created his first invention when he was a vocational school student. At that time, he was working as a factory mechanic. One day, he was using the restroom in the factory. His hands were dirty from work, so he did not want to touch the faucet. He then hoped to design a special faucet which could run automatically without being touched. Teng worked hard to put this idea into practice. Before long, he invented a faucet that was controlled by a built-in sensing device. At the time, he was only seventeen. This young inventor later sold the rights to his invention for NT$1.5 million.      Since then, Teng has created many other useful inventions. He has also represented Taiwan at the iENA exhibition, which is an international exhibition in Germany. He has won first prize there many times. For his many brilliant inventions, Teng has become known as Taiwans Edison.      The other wonderful modern invention that came from a simple need is the Post-it note. Post-it was not successful at first. In fact, it was the result of a failed experiment. Spencer Silver, who was one of the inventors of the Post-it note, had tried to invent a strong glue. Although he experimented with different chemicals, the results never met his expectationsXthe glue that he made turned out to be very weak. He wasnt disappointed, though. Instead, he tried to convince his co-workers of the usefulness of the weak glue, but they did not listen.      However, Silvers weak glue drew someones attention. When Silvers co-worker Art Fry sang hymns during church services, his bookmarks fell out of his hymn book again and again, which really frustrated him. One day, it occurred to him that using Silvers weak glue on a piece of paper might be able to help him mark the right page without damaging the book. Then, he returned to the office and shared his thought with others in the company. The Post-it note was born in 1980, and it has since successfully spread around the world.      As you can see, excellent inventors get ideas from their own experiences. Next time you have a problem, try to think of a way to deal with it. Perhaps you will also become a great inventor someday.

Unit 1  Animal Imagery in Different Languages.      In many languages, certain animals have specific characteristics. In Chinese, pigs are traditionally seen as clumsy animals; dogs represent loyalty; wolves indicate violence as well as cruelty; lions are a symbol of authority.      Likewise, animal imagery can be found in many English expressions, and it has given color to this language. For instance, as quiet as a mouse is commonly used to describe a person who is quiet. You can say, After being caught cheating on the exam, Samuel was as quiet as a mouse in front of his angry parents. However, if someone makes a lot of noise, an elephant would be a good choice for a simile. As a result, a journalist may report, During the sale, the customers crowded into the mall like a herd of elephants. Whats more, if the phrase a white elephant is used to describe something, it means that this item is very expensive but useless. Buying it will apparently be a waste of money because a white elephant costs a fortune but is of no use.      Another elephant-related expression is jumbo jet. Originally, jumbo was the word for elephant in an African language. Later, it was taken as the name of the first circus elephant in the U.S.A. Jumbo gradually became a common name for elephants after the original Jumbos outstanding performances were appreciated by wide audiences. For most English speakers, jumbo has come to share the meaning of the word big. Therefore, a huge jet plane is called a jumbo jet.      Aside from mice and elephants, birds and insects are often used in English expressions as well. A person who is as proud as a peacock often gives others the impression that he or she is too proud of himself or herself. When you call someone a chicken, you mean that the person is a coward and doesnt dare to do something. Moreover, bees are commonly associated with diligence in English. If a friend of yours is always working or tied up, then he or she is a busy bee or is always as busy as a bee.      Additionally, many sayings that include animal imagery also make English an interesting language. The following are just a few examples:      When the cats away, the mice will play.      Let sleeping dogs lie.      There is a black sheep in every flock.      A leopard cannot change its spots.      As you have discovered, the use of animal imagery indeed plays a part in different languages. Without a doubt, it not only makes a language fun to learn, but also helps language learners understand more about a languages culture.      XAdapted from Images of Animals by Paul Snowden. 
Unit 12  A Hero Called Frankenstein.      Are you a fan of sci-fi movies such as Transformers, Man of Steel, or Spider-Man? The sci-fi elements in these films may appeal to you, but did you know that the majority of sci-fi movies have actually been inspired by Mary Shelleys Frankenstein? Frankenstein is regarded as the first work of science fiction. If Mary Shelley had not written this novel, many popular sci-fi characters might not have ever been created.      The title of this novel comes from the name of its hero, Victor Frankenstein, an enthusiastic scientist who found the incredible secret about the creation of life. Excited by this discovery, Frankenstein kept exploring more deeply into the secret to creating a human being. Often in the dead of night, he stole and collected dead bodies from graves. Fascinated by his project, Frankenstein buried himself in his work. At last, his creature was completed and finally came to life.      Contrary to Frankensteins expectations, however, the creature that he had made turned out to be a giant, frightening monster. Frankenstein was so alarmed that he fled in horror. The following day, he returned but found that the monster was gone.      When wandering the world alone, the monster was not welcome anywhere because of his terrible appearance. Hatred for his creator gradually grew in the monsters mind, and this drove him to murder Frankensteins brother. Frankenstein blamed himself as he learned of his brothers death. He thought that he should never have created such a horrible being. Just as Frankenstein fell into a deep depression, the monster turned up in front of him.      Upon meeting Frankenstein again, the monster poured out his heart. In tears, he asked Frankenstein to create a female monster for him, since it was impossible for humans to love a monster. Otherwise, the monster told Frankenstein that he would make Frankensteins life more miserable.      Although agreeing to the monsters request at first, Frankenstein soon had second thoughts. The thought that the two might bear children frightened him, so he destroyed the half-finished creature. I should not have made such a promise, he thought to himself. Upon learning what Frankenstein had done, the monster became so angry that he killed Frankensteins wife and his best friend in revenge. To prevent more misfortunes, Frankenstein followed the monster to the North Pole to hunt him down. Nevertheless, he never succeededXin the end he died from the cold. After learning of Frankensteins death, the monster disappeared and was nowhere to be seen again.      Perhaps it never occurred to Frankenstein that he had to be responsible for the monster he created. He had probably never expected that his enthusiasm for science would lead to so many tragedies. Interestingly, many people have often mistaken the creatures name for Frankenstein. For them, maybe the scientist is the real monster. XPaul Go 
	It is 9 p.m. on a pleasant summer evening and the sun is setting. We are sitting on benches at a beach on Phillip Island. Suddenly a small head pops out of the water. Its a Little Penguin! The Little Penguin stands up and walks out of the water, and then it starts to waddle up the beach. Then, many more Little Penguins come out of the water, and they all follow the first penguin up the beach towards their homes.  	   They are all mother and father penguins, and they have been in the water all day catching fish for their babies. Now they are returning to their homes to feed their hungry young children. The tourists are excited to see the penguins. Tonight there are about 700 Little Penguins altogether. 	   Little Penguins are the smallest penguins in the world. When they are adults, they are only 33 centimeters tall and weigh only one kilogram. They usually have two babies in the summertime each year, and they have to go fishing all day to get enough food to feed their babies. Some days they have to swim up to 20 kilometers to catch the fish. When they swim a long way, the penguins jump in and out of the water like dolphins. In two months in summer they usually catch about 14 kilograms of fish. That is a lot of fish for such small penguins! 	   The penguins live in holes in the ground called burrows. Both parents dig the burrow together, and they make it comfortable for their babies by making a nest inside it out of grass, leaves and twigs. First, the mother lays two eggs, and the parents take turns sitting on the eggs to keep them warm. They do this for about 5 weeks. Then the babies hatch from the eggs, and one parent stays at home to take care of the babies while the other parent goes out to search for fish each day. The parents usually take turns doing this, too. 	   Little Penguins behave in other interesting ways, too. When two penguins are angry with each other, they will stare at each other. When one penguin is angry and the other one is not, the one who is not angry will look away from the other and walk away with its head and body held very low. When Little Penguins want to attract a boyfriend or girlfriend, they will show they like the boy or girl by imitating what they do, or by cleaning the boy or girl penguins feathers.  @@The Little Penguins are fascinating to watch. No wonder they have become one of the  most-loved animals in Australia! 
	In Taiwan, people have two very special and different ways of celebrating the Lantern Festival.In the north, they send thousands of sky lanterns into the night sky, creating a beautiful and peaceful scene of lights floating up toward the heavens. Down south, millions of firecrackers are set off in the streets.  The mood is much wilder, with tens of thousands of people running, jumping, and screaming as they try to escape one missile after another. 	   People who join the Sky Lantern Festival, held in Pinghsi, say they are very moved as they watch the big paper lanterns float away, higher and higher into the sky. Some even feel as if they are sharing a special gift with the rest of the world. To make this gift more special, they often write messages or wishes on the lanterns before they are launched. Thus, it seems the mood of the festival is much the same as when it first started in the 19th century. At that time, there were many bandits that traveled around the countryside, especially during the Chinese New Year.         People were so afraid of them that they often left their homes and hid in the mountains. When the bandits were gone, the village leaders would send lanterns into the sky to tell everyone it was safe to return. The lanterns were a sign of peace in the village. Nowadays, even as the festival gets bigger and more popular every year, this idea has not been lost. For example, in 1999, after the 921 earthquake in Taiwan, festival organizers asked people who were launching lanterns to pray for the earthquake victims and for world peace.  	   The feeling down south in Yenshui, on the other hand, is completely different! Instead of prayers for peace, it looks like war games are taking place! Many people come to the festival fully prepared for danger.         They wear helmets, face masks, and heavy clothing to protect themselves from the firecrackers, which shoot out in all directions on downtown streets. Even with all this protection, some people still end up getting hurt. Sometimes their clothing or hair catches fire, or they are pushed down by the crowd. Although the festival originally started in the 19th century as a means to protect people from danger and disease, it seems now that the sense of danger is what the festival is all about. Some even say that getting hit by firecrackers is a good sign from the heavens.  	   These are certainly two very different faces of the Lantern Festival. So, whichever appeals to your personality, you can head either north or south this year to join in the fun and festivities!
