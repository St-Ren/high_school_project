How much do you know about the history of the elevator? Let’s test your knowledge about elevators! Circle the correct answers. . The first elevator for carrying people was invented in (/). . The inventor of the elevator was from (the U.S./Japan). . The early elevator was moved by (steam/gas). . The world’s fastest elevator is in (the U.S./Taiwan). . The modern elevator makes the development of (tall/strong) buildings possible. 　　There are annual run-up races in famous buildings like the Empire State Building* and Taipei 1*. You can take part in these and possibly win a big prize. However, you may not want to climb up so far every day on your way to work or home. People can’t live and work in a tall building if they have to climb hundreds of stairs every day. The invention of the elevator has made it possible for us to make practical use of skyscrapers. 　　When the elevator was invented in the 1th century, it was powered by steam, not electricity. In 1 the first passenger elevator was installed in a five-story department store in New York*. From that time on, the use of elevators spread widely. In 1, the German* Werner von Siemens* built the electric elevator. 　　Nowadays, we find elevators in most tall buildings. But sometimes waiting for the elevator can be frustrating! There may be several elevators in one building, but each elevator has to make a stop at every floor for people to enter or exit. 　　The “destination* elevator” is a new concept. You push the floor number you want before you enter the elevator. The computer decides which floors each elevator will stop at. Passengers who go to the same floors are grouped together in one elevator. Each elevator then makes only a limited number of stops. 　　The concept is quite similar to carpooling*. During rush hour, passengers may save up to 3% of the time they spend getting to their destination. It is like taking an express bus rather than a local one. 　　There are more than 3, destination elevators worldwide, including a few in Taiwan. Such useful inventions show how small, creative changes can make life much more convenient. 
A Name Is Not Just a Name. @@Jiayi, a high school student in Taiwan, has a new e-pal, Elizabeth, an American high school girl. In her last e-mail to Jiayi, Elizabeth asked about the meaning of Jiayis name in Chinese. In the following e-mails, they share stories about their names. @@ Dear Elizabeth, @@Thanks for the reply. Id be pleased to tell you about my Chinese name. My full name is Tao Jiayi. Tao is my family name and Jiayi is my given name.  @@Tao means a potter, a person who makes clay pots by hand. Our ancestors  might have been potters thousands of years ago. My given name, Jiayi, is from a fortune teller. Most parents in Taiwan go to fortune tellers for a babys name. We Chinese believe that a persons name should match his or her time of birth, or he/she may have an unlucky life. My name is made up of two characters, Jia and Yi. Jia means beautiful and Yi happy. According to the fortune teller, this name is perfect for my time of birth. But in fact, Jiayi is a very common name. There are twenty other students named Jiayi in my school.  @@How about your name? What does it mean? @@Jiayi Dear Jiayi, @@It was so great to get your reply. Thank you for telling me such an interesting story about your name. @@Naming is also a big event here but we dont go to fortune tellers; parents do the job of naming instead. My mom and dad had an equal share in naming me Elizabeth Casas Smith. My first name, Elizabeth, came from my great grandmother on my fathers side, in memory of her. Its a biblical name which means Gods promise. Many English names have meanings that come from the Bible, like David and Sarah. My family usually call me Liz, which is short for Elizabeth. My middle name, Casas, is my mothers maiden name. My mothers family came from Spain and Casas means house in Spanish. My family name, Smith, is one of the most common English family names. It refers to a blacksmith. So one of my ancestors probably worked as a blacksmith a long time ago. My parents always joke that my name means God promises me a house made by a blacksmith. I dont think I want to live in a house made of iron, though.  @@BTW, Id like to have a Chinese name. Do you have any ideas? Liz by Rebecca Evans 
Baseball Fans around the World.                    	Baseball is a very popular sport in Asia, North America, South America, and even Europe. While the rules of baseball are similar from country to country, the  behavior of baseball fans is very different. Heres a quick look at some of the differences in fan behavior around the world. In Japan 	Baseball fans in Japan are loudXreally loud. The sound of chants, cheers, drums, and trumpets continue nonstop throughout a baseball game in Japan. When a team goes to bat, their fans sing a different song for each batter at the plate. Even when their team is losing badly, Japanese fans continue to yell and scream. Foreign baseball players in Japan are often surprised that the fans never boo a player. According to the American pitcher Brian Warren, baseball is more fun in Japan. When I used to play in Venezuela, Warren says, fans threw things at me when I didnt pitch well. This never happens in Japan. In Taiwan                                         	Baseball fans in Taiwan are just as loud as the fans in Japan! In Taiwan, many fans use air horns to cheer their team on. These horns are so loud that they can really hurt your ears. Taiwanese fans often yell Jiayou! Jiayou! which means Go! Go! Go! to cheer the players on. And when a player hits a home run, there is a special tradition. After the player runs around the bases, a young girl presents him with a stuffed animal that looks like his teams mascot. Then the player throws it to the fans sitting in the stands above the dugout. In the United States 	Asian visitors to the United States are often surprised and disappointed by how quiet American baseball fans are. When I went to a baseball game in San Francisco, everybody was just sitting there watching the game. It was kind of boring, says Barry Lin, a Taiwanese student at the University of California, Berkeley. Baseball was invented in the United States, Lin says, but Americans dont seem very excited about their game. 	Its true. Baseball fans in the United States are some of the quietest in the world. Its common to see baseball fans eating hot dogs and popcorn, and chatting with friends. When I go to a baseball game, says Ginger Hanson from San Francisco, I want to have fun with friends and catch up on their lives. The real reason I go is that I want to socialize. In the Dominican Republic 	Like the fans in Japan and Taiwan, the fans in the Dominican Republic cheer loudly throughout the game. They also sing and dance! Since music and dancing are an important part of Dominican culture, you might even find a merengue band moving through the stands at a baseball game. 	Despite the music and dancing, many Dominican fans are very serious about baseball. Carol Parmenter, an American living in the Dominican Republic, says, At Dominican games, you see groups of men drinking small cups of sweet coffee, carefully analyzing every pitch, every hit, every play. American fans dont usually follow the game that closely. 
Things I Learned from Dad. 	During the process of growing up, many people influence our lives: our teachers, our classmates and friends, our brothers and sisters. But perhaps most of all, it is our parents who have the greatest effect on us. Influenced by their example, we learn how to behave and how to live in this world. As we get older, we realize more fully just how important our parents have been in shaping our lives. Below this two stories, from Great Dads, which show how two successful people, Rebecca Lobo and Richard Branson, have been influenced by their fathers.  Be Loving. 	I knew---even when I was very young----just how much my mom and dad loved each other. Whenever one of them went out, they kissed each other goodbye. My brother, sister and I thought this was gross! But when I get married, I can only hope that I will have found someone who loves me as much as Dad loves Mom. Because there was always so much love in the family, I grew up with an incredible security blanket. 	Mom battled breast cancer when I was in college. Despite his worry, Dad was a pillar of strength for us and especially for her. After her mastectomy, she decided against the added trauma of breast-reconstruction surgery. Mom told me that in their entire marriage Dad never even suggested that she change her hairstyle. Instead, he has always told her how beautiful she is. And thats why she thinks fighting cancer wasnt as hard as it could have been. She knew that no matter what, Dad and his love would be there. 	Even now, when my mom goes away for a couple of days, Dad has a hard time with it. I think its because it makes him think about what life would be like without her. I dont know who said it originally, but Mom has passed it along---the most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother. My dad is a perfect example of that. Rebecca Lobo, a former College Player of the Year,  plays basketball for the WNBAs New York Liberty. Encourage. 	My sisters and I grew up in a little village in England. Our father was a struggling lawyer, but I always knew he was special. He never criticized, but used praise to bring out our best. Hed say, If you pour water on flowers, they flourish. If you dont give them water, they die.  @@I remember as a child I said something unkind about somebody, and my father said, Any time you say something unpleasant about somebody else, its a reflection of you. He explained that if I looked for the best in people, I would get the best in return. Ive tried to follow this principle in running my company. 	Dad has also always been very understanding. At 15, I started a magazine. It was taking up a great deal of my time, and the headmaster of my school gave me a choice: stay in school or leave to work on my magazine. 	I decided to leave, and Dad tried to sway me from my decision, as any good father would. When he realized I had made up my mind, he said, Richard, when I was 23, my dad persuaded me to go into law. And Ive always regretted it. I wanted to be an archeologist, but I didnt pursue my dream. You know what you want. Go fulfill that dream. @@As it turned out, my little magazine went on to become Student, a national magazine for young people in the U.K. My wife and I have two children, and Id like to think we are bringing them up in the same way Dad raised me.     
Follow Your Dream. @@I have a friend named Monty Roberts1. He owns a horse ranch1. He often lets me use his house to put on fund-raising events so that I can raise2 money for youth3-at-risk4 programs.  @@The last time I was there he introduced5 me by saying, I want to tell you why I let Jack use my house. It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of a horse trainer6 who would go from stable7 to stable, race track8 to race track, farm to farm, and ranch to ranch, training horses. As a result, the boys high school career9 was continually10 interrupted11. When he was a senior12, he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up. @@That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing13 his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his dream in great detail14 and he even drew a diagram2 of a two-hundred-acre3 ranch, showing the location15 of all the buildings, the stables, and the track. Then he drew a detailed floor plan for a four-thousand-square-foot house that would sit on the two-hundred-acre dream ranch. @@He put a great deal of his heart into the project16 and the next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, See me after class. @@The boy with the dream went to see the teacher after class and asked, Why did I receive an F?  @@The teacher said, This is an unrealistic17 dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from a poor family. You have no resources18. Owning a horse ranch requires19 a lot of money. Theres no way you could ever do it. Then the teacher added20, If you will rewrite21 this paper with a more realistic22 goal, I will reconsider23 your grade. @@The boy went home and thought about it long and hard. He asked his father what he should do. His father said, Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you. @@Finally, after sitting with it for a week, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all. He stated24, You can keep the F and Ill keep my dream.  @@Monty then turned to the group and said, I tell you this story because you are sitting in my four-thousand-square-foot house in the middle of my two-hundred-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper, framed25 over the fireplace4. He added, The best part of the story is that two summers ago that same schoolteacher brought thirty kids to camp out on my ranch for a week. When the teacher was leaving, he said, Look, Monty, I can tell you this now. When I was your teacher, I was something of a dream stealer. During those years I stole26 a lot of kids dreams. Fortunately27 you had enough courage28 not to give up on yours. @@Dont let anyone steal your dreams. Follow your heart, no matter what. 
﻿Rock climbing1 is a popular sport. It trains climbers2’ use of their hands to hold their weight and to balance. Sometimes the goal1 of the climber is to find an area to climb for the real pleasure2 of climbing; at other times, the goal is to climb a very difficult peak3 for the sense of accomplishment4.  If you think that you have to go to the mountains to learn how to climb, you are wrong. There are many places to learn rock climbing in the middle of a city. Some people learn to climb on artificial5 rock walls in city gyms3. One can find climbing walls in parks, at schools, or even in coffee shops! Remember, no matter where you go, you are sure to get some good exercise. What do you need to wear to go climbing? Here are some suggestions6. To climb, you need special shoes and a harness4 around your chest7 to hold you. There are ropes8 to attach9 to your harness. The ropes hold you securely5 so that you do not fall. A beginner6’s wall is usually about fifteen feet high, and you climb straight10 up. There are small pieces of metal11 that stick out for you to stand on and hold on to. Sometimes it is easy to see the next piece of metal to choose12. Sometimes, it’s not. Most people have difficulty controlling13 their fear14 at first. Fear of falling is a normal15 reaction16, so it is difficult not to feel fear. However, when you move away from the wall and find that you are held by the harness and the ropes, you begin to feel safe. You move slowly until you arrive at the top. At the top, the teacher slowly releases17 the rope, and then you slide18 back to the floor. Your arms and legs feel tired, but you feel great.  Climbing attracts19 many people because it is good exercise for almost everyone. Learning to climb is not very difficult. You do not have to be a super7 athlete20 to climb a wall. You use your whole body, especially21 your arms and legs. This sport gives your body a complete22 exercise. When you climb, you strengthen23 your mind as well as your body. This is a sport for people who like a challenge24.  
Unit 10  Why Do We Lie?      When we were kids, we were taught the virtue of honesty through fairy tales and stories. The story of Pinocchio showed us the importance of telling the truth. The boy who cried wolf finally lost all his sheep as well as the trust of his fellow villagers. From these stories, we understand that Honesty is the best policy, but many of us still lie.      We sometimes lie in order to cover up our mistakes. While it is true that we make errors from time to time, some of us dont have the courage to admit that weve made them. For example, some students might deceive their teacher about unfinished homework. They might say that they left it at home when in fact, they didnt even do it. These students didnt want to seem irresponsible, so they made up an excuseXthat is, a lieXto save face.      Another reason we lie is to get out of situations that we dont want to be involved in or cannot manage. If we would rather sleep in on the weekend than go camping with our family, we might give this excuse: I have stayed up late recently to finish a company project, so I need to get some rest. This type of lie is also told by students quite often. For instance, a boy who has been caught cheating on a test might not reveal what has happened to his family. This student may decide not to tell the truth because he isnt confident enough to deal with the anger that he might face. When we dont want to face consequences, lies are convenient ways to avoid difficulties.      In contrast, sometimes we tell white lies in order not to hurt other peoples feelings. If a good friend gets a terrible new haircut, we are likely to lie and say, I like your new haircut. It looks good on you, to spare his or her feelings. This type of lie is generally not considered bad or wrong. Many people tell white lies instead of the truth for the purpose of preventing negative reactions. Therefore, white lies can sometimes be useful in maintaining good relationships.      Similarly, we tell protective lies so as to keep ourselves out of dangerous situations. Parents may teach their children to use this type of lie in certain circumstances. Some parents, for example, ask their children to say that Mom and Dad are too busy to come to the phone if a stranger calls while they are out. In this situation, protective lies may keep people safe from harm.      It is clear that people lie for many reasons, both good and bad. However, it is not always easy to determine which specific reason to give for a lie. Before we lie, perhaps we should rethink our motives. We never know when our lies might be exposed and cause us embarrassment or the loss of peoples trust. XAdapted from Why Do We Lie? 
Unit 8  The Long-Haired Spirits and the Thao.      Sun Moon Lake, which is located in the center of Taiwan, is known for its natural beauty. The Thao, one of Taiwans indigenous tribes, live nearby. A legend about longhaired spirits has been passed on to Thao children from generation to generation.      For centuries, the longhaired spirits had lived at the bottom of Sun Moon Lake, and they had shared the fish in the lake with the Thao. One day, a group of Thao fishermen found that their fishing nets had been seriously damaged, but no one knew the reason for this. They could only tell that the number of fish in their nets was sharply decreasing. Thus, the Thao began to worry about their future.      Numa, a strong Thao hero, volunteered to go into the lake to find out the cause of it. After he jumped into the water, he headed directly for its deepest area and came upon the answer thereXa longhaired spirit was destroying the Thaos fishing nets. Numa swam quickly toward it and tried to stop it from tearing more of the nets. The two then had a fierce fight underwater for three days.      Finally, the spirit spoke, Listen to me, you foolish man! I would rather lose my life today than let your people bring destruction on all of us! The spirit continued, In the past, there were enough fish in the lake for both of us. However, you humans have been blinded by your greed! With the large number of small-mesh nets you use, you are emptying the lake of its fish. Dont you know that once the fish in the lake are gone, we will all die of hunger?      When Numa heard the spirits warning, he was shocked and embarrassed at what the Thao had done. It dawned on him that the lake had supported his tribe for generations. He made peace with the long-haired spirit before he returned to his tribe. Numa then told the tribes elders what had happened in the lake, and they made a wise decision: The Thao would catch just enough fish to eat instead of letting their greed lead them to destruction.      To avoid catching baby fish, the Thao no longer used small-mesh nets from then on. Therefore, the fish in the lake wouldnt become extinct. The Thao chose to listen to the spirits voice that called for harmony with nature, and they came to realize that they could wisely use the natural resources they had been blessed with. XOscar Chong 
Unit 10  Ice-Cream Tasters Have a Sweet Job.      John Harrison has an enviable job in most peoples opinion. Hes the official taster for Dreyers Grand Ice Cream, one of the best-selling ice-cream brands in the U.S.A. On an average day, Harrison has to sample sixty ice creams at the Dreyers headquarters. When he isnt doing that, he travels all over the country, buying Dreyers ice cream in supermarkets so that he can carry out spot checks for appearance, texture, and flavor. But, no matter how wonderful this job may sound, it is actually quite tough. Its difficult work, requiring discipline, selflessness, and thorough preparation.      Before tasting a sample, Harrison uses his eyes first. If the ice cream doesnt look attractive, he skips it. Then, he uses a gold spoon instead of one made of wood, plastic, or other metals. This is because regular spoons leave an aftertaste that can dull the taste buds. In addition, the temperature of the ice cream may also influence the tasters taste buds. If the ice cream is too cold, it will numb the taste buds.      Whats more, ice-cream tasters dont swallow any ice cream while theyre on duty. When Harrison samples ice cream, he first takes only a small bite of the ice cream, swishes it around in his mouth to introduce it to each of his taste buds, lightly licks his lips, and then gently breathes in so as to bring the smell up through the back of his mouth to his nose. With each step, he carefully sizes up whether the ice cream conveys the ideal balance between dairy sweetness and the flavor of the added ingredients. And last of all, no matter what the ice cream tastes like, he spits it out, since a full stomach makes for a dull palate.      For Harrison, keeping a sharp palate means that other sacrifices must also be made: No onions, garlic, or cayenne pepper. He also doesnt have any caffeine, since this blocks the taste buds. Thus, he usually has a cup of caffeine-free herbal tea for breakfast in order that his job will not be affected. But to him, this is just a small price to pay for what he calls the worlds best job.      Harrisons family has been in the ice-cream business for four generations, and Harrison himself has spent almost his whole life in it as well. Yet, he has never lost his love of the cold, creamy sweetness. He orders ice cream in restaurants for dessert, even when hes not at work. On these occasions, he swallows the ice cream, taking in about a liter a week. Though he has gained some weight over the years hes been with Dreyers, he couldnt care less. Who would trust a skinny ice-cream taster? he jokes. XAdapted from Ice Cream Tester Has Sweet Job. 
Unit 8  Mothers Hands.      Night after night, Mom came to tuck me in, even long after my childhood years. As part of her nightly routine, she would lean down, push my long hair out of the way, and then kiss me on the forehead.      I dont remember when it started annoying meXher hands touching my face that way. But it did annoy me, for they felt rough against my young skin. One night, I finally roared, Dont do that anymoreXyour hands are too rough! Upon hearing this, Mom stepped out of my room without saying a word. I lay awake long afterward with my words haunting me. However, pride suppressed the voice of my conscience, and I didnt tell her I was sorry. From that day forward, Mom would never again close out my day with that familiar expression of her love.      With the passing years, my thoughts have time after time returned to that night. I realized one thing: If I had been mature enough, I would not have said such a mean thing to my mom. I missed Moms hands and her good-night kiss. Sometimes, the incident seemed very close and sometimes far away, and yet it was always thereXin the back of my mind.      Years have passed, and I am no longer a young girl. Mom is in her mid-seventies, and those hands I once thought were too rough are still taking care of me and my family. They have reached into medicine cabinets for a remedy to calm a girls upset stomach or soothe the pain of a boys scraped knee. These very same hands have also cooked the best fried chicken in the world, gotten stains out of my jeans, and dished out ice cream on hot summer days.      Now, my own children are grown and gone, and Mom doesnt have Dad any longer. On special occasions, I go to her place to spend the night with her. On the night before a Thanksgiving, as I drifted into sleep in my old bedroom, a loving hand hesitantly stole across my face to brush the hair from my forehead. Then a kiss, ever so gently, touched my eyebrow.      For the thousandth time, I recalled the night when my young voice had ungratefully complained. I understood that if I had apologized to Mom on the spot, I might not have been so regretful later. Right then, upon sensing that she was about to leave, I involuntarily seized her hand in mine. I told her how sorry I was for that night. To my surprise, Mom didnt get angry at me; in fact, she didnt even remember the incident. She had forgivenXand forgottenXlong before.      That night, I fell asleep with a new appreciation of my gentle mother and her caring hands. The guilt I had carried around for so long was nowhere to be found.

Unit 9  The Warmer It Gets, the Worse Things Become.      The animated film Farewell, created by the Taiwanese artist Chu-Ling Hsu, won a Special Mention at the AniFest in 2009. This short film portrayed the very last polar bear on Earth saying farewell from a melting iceberg before drowning. Hsu made this film to warn that global warming had already become quite serious, hoping that her film could help focus public attention on environmental protection.      Just as this animated film shows, polar bears are at risk of becoming extinct. They have not only been over-hunted and badly affected by water and air pollution, but also been threatened by global warming. Because of global warming, large amounts of Arctic ice are melting away, and the seal population is falling sharply. Polar bears, which live on seals, are thus rapidly decreasing in number since they have fewer places to live in and are often unable to find enough food to eat.      After learning of this, you might wonder whether human beings will become victims of global warming as well. In fact, this is the case. This fatal warming is caused by the huge amounts of carbon dioxide discharged into the atmosphere by the burning of fuels. The carbon dioxide absorbs the suns heat and keeps it from escaping back into space, and thus causes the earth to warm. As the planet has warmed up, ice in the polar regions has begun to melt, which results in rising sea levels worldwide. Small islands and low coastal areas could soon be underwater, and the residents of major cities such as London, Shanghai, and Taipei are likely to have nowhere to live by the end of the 21st century.      Global warming can also lead to severe climate change, and this may cause the deaths of hundreds of people at a time. Many readers probably still remember how in 2012 Hurricane Sandy took the lives of more than 200 people in the American continents and caused damage to property estimated at over US$68 billion. And now, more and more land that used to be fertile has become barren, since the deserts near the equator are expanding. Because of such negative effects of global warming, human beings might also face starvation before long, just as many polar bears have already experienced.      When polar bears are starving due to a lack of food, they are likely to kill and eat one another. Imagine such a horrible scene and ask yourself if you can bear to let this happen. If we want to save our furry friends, both the people and the governments of the world should take immediate action to deal with this issue before it is too late. We need to seize every opportunity to slow global warming, or food shortages will be just one of the terrible tragedies that we will experience in the near future. By then, it might just be our turn to say farewell to the planet. XKarl Nilsson 
	What did your parents do to celebrate when you were born? Of course you cant remember, but maybe they have photos from a ceremony of some kind. People usually have ceremonies to mark important events in life. For example, there are wedding ceremonies. Getting married is an important event, and having a baby is, too. In most cultures, there are ceremonies and other traditional ways to celebrate a new child in the family.     In the United States, the proud parents of a new baby often decorate their front door. Its an exciting time for them, and they want to share the good news with their neighbors. For example, they may put balloons on their door. Pink balloons mean the baby is a girl. Blue ones are for boys. New fathers used to hand out cigars to all their friends. Today, that tradition continues, but things are a little different. Only about 25% of American adults smoke, so the cigars are sometimes made of chocolate.     People around the world often celebrate a new baby with some type of ceremony, perhaps a religious ceremony. This may take place when a baby is a few days or weeks old. In Korea, theres a traditional ceremony on the babys 100th day. In Mexico, many new parents dress their babies in special clothes and take them to church. In some African cultures, the family plants a tree.     New babies in every culture have one thing in common: they all need names. Sometimes the parents choose their babys name before the child is born.  @@However, a babys name is not always the parents decision. Sometimes the name depends on family traditions, and some babies get their names at religious ceremonies.     Parents in the United States sometimes put the news about their baby in the newspaper. For example:     Smith, Michael James, Jr. Born July 4, son of Michael J. and Sarah Dean Smith of Deerfield . @@This baby has the same name as his father. Michael is a very common American name. Some American parents want unusual names for their children. Apple Kaufmann has a very uncommon  first name. She says, My parents let my eight-year-old brother name me!     The parents of new babies often receive presents. In the United States, friends send them cards, flowers, and baby clothes. Presents, celebrations -these things are great. But what do most new parents really need? More sleep!
