 　　As a modern citizen, you will surely want to learn more about the world. You can do so by learning a foreign language or traveling to the country of your dreams for a short stay. You may also watch such TV programs as those on the Discovery Channel*. But there is something you really can’t miss—the various foods on the menu! 　　Yes, food! Food can be a very good tour guide. It not only pleases your mouth and tongue, but also reflects the climate and geography of a place. Take Thailand* for example. It is a warm tropical country, and most people there like sour and spicy food. In the mountains, there are plenty of bugs and worms. People there have the grasshoppers* and scorpions* roasted, fried, and spiced. They also put red ant* eggs on toast and in a Thai* salad. These foods may look weird* to others. To the local people, however, they are very tasty, low in fat, and rich in protein*. 　　Up north in Alaska*, there are not so many bugs but there are plenty of fish. People there leave salmon* heads and guts* in the ground for weeks, and then have them made into a tasty dish when they become rotten. Jellied* moose* noses and bear stews* are also commonly seen on the tables of Eskimos*. These dishes may make other people wrinkle up their noses. However, they show how Eskimos live on the things that are available in a world of ice and snow. 　　So, next time you are served unfamiliar food, don’t wrinkle up your nose. Instead, dig in or at least sample some of it. The unusual dishes on the menu can be a lovely window on the world that is weird but wonderful! 
﻿ 　　Idioms are phrases whose meanings are different from the literal* meanings of the words they contain. The meaning of an idiom is often not obvious or clear. You may find it difficult to understand the expression even if you think you know every word in it. 　　There are all kinds of idioms that are used to express a number of different and special meanings. One very common theme of English idioms is body parts. If you listen or read carefully, you will probably find that many idioms contain body parts. Body parts are often used in idioms probably because they are so close to us. 　　Imagine the following situation: your American friend Matt told you that he had his heart set on buying the latest cell phone. However, he knew that it would cost an arm and a leg, so he had to get a part-time job and work his fingers to the bone on evenings and weekends in order to pay for it. 　　Matt also told you about his part-time job at a convenience store. One day, a suspicious-looking customer came into the store. Matt suspected that the guy had sticky fingers. He watched him carefully and caught him red-handed trying to slip a packet* of gum into his pocket. 　　You might have a difficult time understanding what Matt was talking about. However, from the context of what he said and the way in which he used the words, you could figure out that Matt wanted very much to buy a really expensive cell phone, and that he had to work very hard to make enough money to buy it. In the store, Matt saw a shoplifter* who was trying to steal some gum, and he caught him on the spot. 　　Idioms may be difficult to understand, and may take a lot of time to learn. However, they make our language much more interesting and colorful. Learn more about them, and you will find that using and understanding them can be a lot of fun! 
﻿ 　　Have you ever felt down because of the pressure at school? Are you worried about your poor interpersonal* relationships? As a matter of fact, millions of people are suffering from a kind of light depression, often called the blues. When that happens, sufferers may experience times of very low energy. 　　No matter what causes you to feel blue, you had better find a way to beat the blues and keep on going. Exercise, for example, is a great start. Physical activities cause the body to release endorphins*, which produce a feeling of well-being. Endorphins raise your spirits in the short run. Good health and the feeling of accomplishment that come with regular exercise do so in the long run. To get the positive effects of exercise, you don’t need to run a marathon*. Just keep your body moving with twenty minutes of jogging, bicycling, or brisk* walking three to four times a week. 　　Some doctors also believe that there is a connection between food and mood. To put it simply, what you eat can affect how you feel. If you consume too much junk food, then you may end up feeling down in the dumps. If you drink too much tea or coffee, the caffeine* may provide an immediate boost* of energy. However, it may also keep you from getting a good night’s sleep, making you feel even worse later on. Fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, will always do you good and make you feel better. 　　There are some other ways to lighten your mood and they cost nothing. For example, you can take a few deep breaths. Controlled breathing can lower your blood pressure and raise your energy level. Getting proper amounts of sunlight also helps a lot when you are moody. Besides, being a volunteer will make you happy because you know you are still strong enough to help so many people in need. You can also make a list of all the good things in life. By doing so, you will appreciate your life more. 　　While the list of things you can do to beat the blues could go on and on, one important point is that you have to adopt an active lifestyle rather than react to events passively. After all, it’s you who have to be responsible for your own happiness!   
﻿ 　　Global warming* is an issue that is being discussed everywhere. We have learned to help solve the problem by saving energy and recycling resources. However, we may not be aware that changing our diet can also help stop global warming. 　　For a start, we can simply choose to eat more vegetables and less meat. According to a study of consumer behavior in the U.S., meat consumption is one of the major causes of damage to the environment. For one thing, all farm animals, such as cows and pigs, release methane* from their bodies. One cow can produce up to 6 liters of methane each day, and methane is the second most common greenhouse gas* after carbon dioxide*. Many environmental experts now believe that methane is even more responsible for global warming than carbon dioxide. For another thing, meat production affects the environment through the use of water and land. Look at the charts below. The amount of water and land used to produce meat is many times as much as that used to grow crops. Obviously, a vegetarian diet can benefit not only our health but also our environment. 　　In addition, food that travels a long distance to the market is not friendly to the environment. Therefore, some people are now promoting the idea of eating local foods. We may count how many calories our food contains, but we rarely count how many miles the food has traveled before it reaches our table. For example, California* grapes travel more than 1, kilometers to Taiwan, and Fuji apples* over 2,. This long-distance transportation by truck, ship, or plane means more consumption of oil. Thus, if we eat more local foods, we can reduce the amount of greenhouse gas we produce. 　　Like eating local foods, eating seasonal foods is also a good way to lower the burden on our environment. Fruits and vegetables that are not in season need more fertilizer* to grow and more electricity to store. Therefore, out-of-season foods are usually more expensive. Smart consumers, especially housewives, should make better and wiser choices. 　　Our choice of food obviously has a serious influence on our whole planet, especially when its limited resources are nearly used up. So for ourselves, and for a better environment for our future generations, let’s start to change our eating habits. 
﻿　　One cold, rainy night, a police officer on patrol* walked up to a man who had caught his eye. The man had been standing on the corner for fifteen minutes—strange, particularly in this weather. The man spoke up quickly and reassuringly. “It’s all right, officer. I’m just waiting for my friend Jimmy Wells.” 　　The officer looked surprised. The man laughed,“You see, we made this appointment twenty years ago, before I headed for the West*.” He went on to explain that on the night they parted, they promised each other that, if they were still alive after twenty years, they would meet again here. “We tried writing to each other, but soon we lost touch, as I was constantly moving from place to place. But sir, wherever I went, I was always looking forward to this day.” 　　“What a true friend you are!”the officer said, offering to light the man’s cigar. As the officer struck a match, he saw the man more clearly—a scar* near his keen eyes, a square face, and a shiny gold pin with a large, shiny diamond on his scarf. 　　“Thanks,”the man puffed*,“Jimmy was a decent* man and I hope he’s done well.” The officer said, “Well, sir, I’m sure you’ve done well yourself.” The man grinned,“How right you are! Life in the West was tough. I had been competing with some smart guys and taking a few chances. But I did well.” 　　The officer replied,“I have to go. Are you sure you want to wait? It’s cold.” 　　The man nodded,“Yes. I believe Jimmy will show up.” The officer bade* him good night and left. The man looked at his gold watch, whose hands, made of small diamonds, said three minutes to ten.  　　The wind blew harder. The man pulled up his coat collar. The cold was nothing; he had seen much worse. 　　A tall man in a long overcoat and a hat hurried from across the street. He walked straight to the man who had been waiting, paused, and asked,“Is that you, Bob?” 　　“Jimmy Wells! I’m so glad to see you!”shouted the man from the West. 　　The tall man gave him a hug. “How has the West treated you, old friend?” 　　Bob said,“It has given me everything I wanted. Now, you’ve changed quite a bit, Jimmy. You look two or three inches taller. How have you been doing in New York?” 　　“Not bad,”said the tall man. “I work for the city government. Bob, let’s go somewhere and chat about the old times.” 　　The two men walked arm in arm. The man from the West talked proudly about himself; the other man listened with interest. 　　When they came in front of a drugstore that was bright with lights, each man turned to look at each other. 　　The man from the West stopped suddenly and released the other man’s arm. 　　“You’re not Jimmy Wells!”he shouted, looking startled*. “Twenty years is a long time, but not long enough to change the shape of a man’s nose.” 　　“It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one,”said the tall man, putting his arm on Bob’s shoulder, “You are under arrest, Bob. The Chicago* police informed us of your coming here. Before we go to the station, here’s a note for you. It’s from Officer Wells.” 　　The man from the West read the note. His hand trembled.     Bob: I was there on time. When I struck the match, I was finally certain that you were the man wanted for robbery in Chicago. Somehow, I couldn’t arrest you myself. So I got my colleague* to do it. 
Understanding Your Dreams. @@Do you know we spend about one third of our lives sleeping? During that time, we are also dreaming. While dreaming, we can interact with different people, places, and things. Below are the meanings of some common dreams that people have. Im Naked! @@Clothes are a means of hiding yourself. Without them, everything is there for all to see. You are left without any defenses. A dream in which you are naked may be telling you that you are trying to be something you really are not, or that you are afraid of being laughed at and made fun of.  @@ Im Being Chased!  @@Chase dreams often come from some anxiety in your life. Often in these dreams, you are being pursued by someone who wants to hurt or kill you. You are running away, hiding, or trying to outwit your pursuer. Ask yourself who is the one chasing you, and you might discover the source of your fear or sense of pressure. Im Flying!       Many dreamers have described the ability to fly in their dreams as an experience of joy and freedom. The ability to control your flight shows your sense of power. Having trouble staying in flight shows a lack of power in controlling your own life situation. Things like power lines, trees, and mountains may block your flight. They are like barriers that are standing in your way in your waking life.  Im Falling!       Falling dreams are a common theme in the world of dreams. These dreams obviously express your basic human fear of heights, the anxiety you feel when you stand near the edge of a high place. They may reflect the way you feel in a relationship. Falling dreams can also express your fear of failing in your job or in school, or your fear of falling in status.   I Failed the Test!       Such dreams reflect your anxiety. You may find that you cannot answer any of the questions on a test. Is time running out? Are you late for the exam? Does your pencil keep breaking? These dreams usually have to do with your self-esteem and confidence. You are worried that you are not meeting other peoples expectations of you.       Dreams can help us discover our deepest secrets or hidden feelings. But five minutes after the end of a dream, half of its content is forgotten. After ten minutes, 90 percent is lost. So if you want to understand your dreams, youd better have a good memory! 
The Courageous Manager.      Cindy was a very powerful woman who owned several companies and made millions of dollars a year. One day she threw a party at her house for the managers of all her companies. When the executives arrived, they couldnt believe their eyesXCindy lived in a mansion.      Cindy welcomed everybody with a smile. She offered to take them all on a tour of her luxurious mansion and the surrounding property.      Every room was as beautiful as it could be, but the really interesting part was outside. Behind the house was a large swimming pool.      Look! someone gasped. The huge pool was filled with hungry alligators. Cindy looked at her managers and said, I brought you all out here for a reason. I think executives should be measured by their courage. Courage is what made me into the successful person you see before you today.      So this is my challenge for each of you.      If anyone here has enough courage to dive into this pool, swim through those alligators, and make it to the other side, I will give that person anything he wishes. Even if he wants my money, my companies, or my beautiful house, I will give it to him.      Everyone laughed at Cindys ridiculous offer. No one took her seriously. As they turned to go back into the house, there was a loud splash. Everyone turned and looked at the pool. The youngest manager was in the pool, swimming for his life. As the alligators swam toward him, he dodged them left and right.      After several minutes, he made it to the edge of the pool. He pulled himself out just as a huge alligator snapped at his shoe. He then dropped onto a chair, panting.      Cindy was astonished. She held out a towel for the young man, You are amazing. Ive never seen anything like that before. You are brave beyond measure and I will be true to my word. Just say the word and Ill make all your wishes come true. The young man looked up at Cindy and said, Yes, I do have a wish. I want you to tell me who pushed me into the pool!  Xby Cherise Arnesen from Stories of Laugher, Very Good Culture Co., Ltd. Reprinted with permission. 
Healthy Again. @@Mr. Cho was worried when he saw that something was wrong with his goldfish. They had red patches on their skin, they werent eating, and they didnt have much energy. It seemed they had some sort of infection, and Mr. Cho was afraid they wouldnt last long. He decided, however, that he would not take the fish to the veterinarian. Instead, he would try his own cure:  acupuncture. @@He stuck long, thin needles into the backs of the fishes, and he left them there for several minutes. He repeated the treatment several times over the next few days. Soon the fish appeared to be feeling much better. Mr. Cho was relieved when he saw them swimming around energetically and beginning to eat again. The red patches also disappeared. Did the fish get better because of the acupuncture treatments? Mr. Cho, who himself is a professional acupuncturist, thinks they did.    Although acupuncture for goldfish is uncommon, acupuncture for people is very common in some East Asian countries, where acupuncturists like Mr. Cho help many people to overcome a wide range of medical problems, including infections, backaches, and stomachaches. They sometimes even use acupuncture during operations to prevent patients from feeling any pain.    To see what happens during an acupuncture treatment, we can take Ming Wang as an example. Ming, a man who suffers from chronic headaches, decided to go to Dr. Han, an acupuncturist. Heres what happened at Dr. Hans office.     First, Dr. Han examined Ming and asked him about his headaches. Then, the doctor began to insert the one-inch-long acupuncture needles. Ming was surprised to find that Dr. Han inserted the needles in his neck and foot, instead of in his head. The doctor explained that the needles were not inserted in the place where the patient felt pain, but in special points corresponding to the bodys flow of energy. As Dr. Han pressed the needles into Mings skin, Ming was surprised again. He felt a slight pinch when each needle went in, but otherwise, he found it didnt hurt at all.     Acupuncture has helped millions of people like Ming, not only in Asia, but throughout the world. Many, many people testify that acupuncture really works. But how does it work?    One explanation, thousands of years old, was given by the ancient ChineseXthe first to use acupuncture. They believed that energy flowed through the human body along certain paths. They thought that too much or too little energy flowing to one part of the body would cause pain or sickness. They discovered, however, that there were several hundred places on the body where an acupuncturist could change the flow of energy. These places were called acupuncture points. A needle inserted into an acupuncture point on a patients leg, for example, would change the flow of energy to the patients stomach. When the energy flowed correctly again, the patient would feel better.                                                 @@There is also a modern explanation of how acupuncture works. Scientists point out that the acupuncture points have many more nerve endings than other places on the skin. Nerve endings receive pain messages when someone is sick or hurt. The pain messages then travel through the nerves. Perhaps the acupuncture needles also send messages through the nerves, but these messages interrupt the pain messages before they reach the brain. As a result, the patient feels better. 	People who have been helped by acupuncture probably dont care which explanation is correct. They are just happy to be like Mr. Chos goldfishXhealthy again. 
Unit 1  Lost in the New School.      Jack Wang is standing at the gate of his new school. He is so nervous that his heart is pounding. Today is his first day at an American high school. Jack is from Taiwan, and his family just moved to the United States last month. He is quite worried. Can he communicate with his new classmates? Will he make new friends?      Jack plucks up the courage to walk into the school. On the hall walls, he sees many sports medals and pictures of students who are wearing costumes and playing different roles in dramas.      Where should I go? Jack wonders. I am lost already. The students that walk past him are chatting happily, so he doesnt ask any of them for help. Then, a woman walks over to Jack. Good morning, she says. I am the principal, Ms. Smith. Can I help you?      Yes, says Jack. My name is Jack Wang. I am a new student here.      Nice to meet you, Jack, she says. Please come with me.      They go into her office. Here, she says and gives him a piece of paper. This is your class schedule.      There are two important numbers on your schedule. The first is 104. That is the number of your homeroom, Ms. Smith continues. It is the classroom which you have to go to at the beginning of your school day. After that, you will need to go to different classrooms for different classes. Dont forget to check your class schedule carefully. The second number is 78, your locker number. Your locker is next to your homeroom. You can store your books and personal belongings inside.      Jack thanks Ms. Smith and goes to his locker. An Asian boy is standing next to it.      Hi, says the boy. I am Ken. My locker is next to yours.      I know you are new here because you look a bit confused and lost, Ken says. The first day at a new school is always difficult. Do you want to meet me in the cafeteria for lunch?      Suddenly Jack feels better. Ken seems to be such a nice guy that Jack gives him a big smile. Sounds great, Jack says. How did you know that I needed help? Was it that obvious?      Ken laughs and replies, Last year, I was a new student as well, so I can totally understand your feelings. By the way, would you like to play basketball with me after school? You can make some friends on the basketball court.      Great! I love basketball, but I can only stay for a short while, Jack answers. I have to head back home for dinner, or my mom will . . .       Sorry to interrupt you, but youd better check out your class schedule again. Classes end at half past two. We will have plenty of time before dinner, Ken reminds Jack.      Jack is surprised to find that there are so many differences between the schools in Taiwan and the schools in the U.S.A., but he still has high hopes of fitting in soon in the future.

Unit 2  A Lesson in Forgiveness.      When I was a kid, I delivered newspapers in my community every day. On a quiet Saturday afternoon, my friend and I were bored, so we randomly picked an old ladys house to be part of our game of throwing stones. We wanted to see the stones turn into missiles as they rolled to the roofs edge and shot out into the yard. To me, they looked just like comets that fell from the sky.      I found a stone and sent it for a ride. However, the stone was too smooth to grasp, so it slipped out of my hand when I threw it. It hit a small window in the ladys house with a crash. Since we were frightened of being caught, we escaped at the sound of the broken glass.      For the next few days, I was so worried about myself that I did not think of the old lady and her broken window. Later on, when I was sure that I wasnt in trouble, I started to feel guilty. Every day, the old lady greeted me with a warm smile as I passed her the paper, but I didnt feel comfortable in her presence anymore.      Finally, I made up my mind to save the money which I made from delivering newspapers. I calculated that seven dollars should cover the cost of repairing her window, and in three weeks, I had the seven dollars ready. I put the money in an envelope and wrote a note that said, I am sorry for breaking your window. I hope that the money will cover the cost of repairing it.      When it was dark, I crept quietly to the old ladys house and slipped the envelope under her door. After I did so, I felt relieved and couldnt wait to look her straight in the eye once again.      The next day, I handed the old lady her paper and happily returned the warm smile that I received from her. She thanked me for the paper and gave me a bag of cookies. I thanked her and then left.      I walked away and enjoyed the cookies. They tasted great. After I had eaten several, I discovered an envelope inside the bag and pulled it out. When I opened it up, I was very surprised. In the envelope, there were the seven dollars and a short note that said, Im proud of you!      XAdapted from True Forgiveness. 
Unit 7  A Little Science Works a Lot of Magic.      Things often have more uses than you could ever imagine. Some common items that we use every day can seem to perform magic when you know how to use them. Take sugar cubes, for example. You can add one to coffee or tea to make the drink sweet. However, most people dont know that theres another thing that sugar cubes can doXkeep cookies crisp!      Just prepare two jars of cookies, and put several sugar cubes into one of the jars. After two weeks, you will find that the cookies in the jar with the sugar cubes in it are crisper than those cookies in the other jar.      Its an easy way to keep cookies crisp, isnt it? If your friends are surprised, tell them how it works. The sugar cubes in the jar can absorb moisture. Thats why you can keep cookies from turning soft. Better yet, the same method can be used to store milk powder, melon seeds, peanuts, and so on.      If your friends are not impressed by the magic of sugar cubes, try the following trick: Use oil or citrus peel to get rid of the stains which are made by markers or correction fluid. Have you ever stained your desk with markers or correction fluid by accident? When you have difficulty removing the stains with tissues, rags, or even your bare hands, what else can you do? Try using some oil or citrus peel!      Believe it or not, baby oil, medicated oil, or even oil from potato chips can help remove stubborn stains effectively. Just follow these steps. First, prepare some baby oil. Then, put a few drops of the oil on the stain. Two minutes later, gently wipe up the oil and the stain with some tissues. Amazingly, the stained area will look clean again. Citrus peel also works in this situation. Just prepare some peel from a citrus fruit such as an orange, lemon, or lime. Next, squeeze a few drops of juice from the peel on the stains. Lastly, rub the stains with the citrus peel. The stains will gradually come off, and finally they will be gone. The secret behind the magic is that the organic substances from these kinds of oil and the acid content from a citrus peel can help break down the stains, and thus, make them easier to remove.      Although these tricks may seem like magic, they are really just examples of the use of science in our everyday lives. Science can look like magic when you dont understand it. However, when you do, you will realize that science is not just for the laboratory, but also for life. XPaul Geraghty. Revised by J.P. Raptor. 
     A high school science teacher wants to demonstrate a concept to his students. He takes a large-mouthed jar and places several large rocks in it. He then asks the class, Is it full?      The whole class replies, Yes!      The teacher then takes a bucket of gravel and pours it into the jar. The small rocks settle into the spaces between the big rocks.      He then asks the class, Is it full?      This time some students hold back, but most reply, Yes!      The teacher then produces a large can of sand and pours it into the jar. The sand fills up the spaces between the bits of gravel.      For the third time, the teacher asks, Is it full?      Now most of the students are wary of answering, but again, many reply, Yes!      Then the teacher brings out a pitcher of water and pours it into the jar. The water saturates the sand. At this point the teacher asks the class, What is the point of this demonstration?      One bright young student raises his hand and then answers, No matter how full ones schedule is in life, one can always squeeze in more things!      Very good, replies the teacher, but the most important point is that unless you put the big rocks into the jar first, you are never going to get them in. The big rocks are the important things in your lifeXyour family, your friends, your personal growth. If you fill your life with small things, like the gravel, the sand, and the water, you will never have space for the important things.      So, what are the big rocks in your life? Spending time with your family? Taking classes to get the information you need? Making time for school clubs? When you feel that you dont have enough time for everything, remember the story about the big rocks and the jar! 
	Kacey McCallister always dreamed of playing basketball on the Boys Club team. At first the coach wouldnt let him play, so Kacey practiced hard. Now he is on the team, but he is not the best player. This 11-year-old boy can dribble and pass as well as the other kids, but he moves up and down the court more slowly. And shooting a basket is difficult for Kacey because he has no legs.     Kacey lost both legs in an accident. When he was six, he ran into the street and a tractor-trailer hit him. But Kacey doesnt let his physical challenge stop him from doing the things he loves. He has learned to play many sports. In basketball he dribbles the ball with one hand and uses his other hand to move his body around the court. Kacey also plays baseball. He can catch and throw the ball very well. He can hit the ball well, too. He is the teams catcher, so he doesnt have to move around so much.     Kacey is one of more than 50,000 physically challenged people in the United States who play sports. These days physically challenged people are doing everything from biking and scuba diving to mountain climbing and rafting. They are dancing and doing martial arts as well.     Some physically challenged people are great athletes. With hard work and strong wills, they go beyond their physical challenges and make their dreams come true. Sharon Hedrick was the first woman to race the Boston Marathon in a wheelchair. She also competed in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. There she won the womens wheelchair 800-meter race in record time.     Diana Golden became the U.S. Alpine Skier of the year skiing on one leg. She came in 10th, racing against able-bodied skiers. In 1988 the U.S. Olympic Committee named her Female Skier of the Year over all other racers, including able-bodied skiers.     The Paralympic Games are for physically challenged people. In 1996, the Tenth Paralympic Games were held in Atlanta, Georgia, right after the summer Olympics. Over 3,000 physically challenged athletes from around the world competed. In Nagano, Japan, 1,000 athletes competed in winter sports at the Paralympic Games in 1998.     Everyone can learn something from physically challenged athletes like Kacey, Sharon, and Diana. Kacey says, Dont let anything get you down. Just play and have fun. Dont let anybody tell you you cant do something.  Just say, I can!  
	As you drive or walk along the streets in almost any city, you cant help but notice that there are signs everywhere: store signs, street signs, and traffic signs. Walk into a store or office, and youll see more signs. While many of these signs use words as well as images to communicate, there are also many that rely entirely on symbols. Think, for example, of this sign: (No U-turn). Or this one: (No Smoking). No language is necessary to know what these symbols mean. Anyone from any country, speaking any language, can understand them.  That is why they are called international signs.  	   International signs have become increasingly important around the world as more and more people are traveling from country to country. You will find them very often at places like airports, train stations, and bus stations. While many of these signs, like the ones mentioned above, can be understood quickly and easily, others may be new to you. A sign like this, for example, tells you where you can find a cart for your luggage, while tells you where there are lockers available for you to store your belongings in. If youre hungry, you probably wont need anyone to tell you what this means: (restaurant).  	   You will also come across many international signs on highways and important roads. Its easy to find a gas station, a motel, or even a phone, for example, if you just watch for the, and signs. Even more important than these are signs that indicate traffic regulations or warn against dangerous driving situations. , for instance, means that the driver will soon enter a divided highway, while means that the road is about to become narrower. The driver who sees knows that rocks may fall from the side of a hill into the road. There are even signs in some areas that will warn you of deer or cows  wandering onto the road.  	   International signs are certainly a great help to travelers. Unfortunately, there are many situations in which symbols cannot replace the need for language. Some very important signs still include words-for example, signs that say Entrance or Exit or Danger! Therefore, in order to understand signs, we need to know the words as well as the symbols.  
	Science plays a big role in everything we do in the kitchen. It is the magic that turns a pile of ingredients like flour, sugar and eggs into something new, like a chocolate cake.   	   Have you ever boiled eggs, and found them split open in the water? Next time try remembering this physics3 lesson: heated air expands! 	   But how will this lesson help you boil an egg? The fat end of an egg has a small air bubble. When this air is heated by the boiling water, it expands and causes the egg shell to crack. Solution? Use a pin to make a small hole into the bottom of the egg before you boil it. This will give the expanding air a way to escape, without cracking the shell. 	   Do you know the chemistry behind a good steak? The heat from the pan causes a reaction in the meat. This happens when protein and sugars in the meat join together to form a new molecule. Its this new molecule that slowly changes the color of the meat from red to pink and gives the steak its flavor. Remember the pan must be hot enough for this reaction to occur; otherwise , youll have a gray and flavorless steak.   	   Have you ever sliced an onion? Did it make you cry? When you cut up an onion you are allowing a reaction to occur. Onions contain sulphur compounds. When you cut the onion, these compounds are released into the air and irritate your eyes.   	   The next time you need to chop an onion, remember this short science lesson: reactions happen slower at lower temperatures. Put the onion in the refrigerator first; it will then release fewer irritating compounds when you cut it.   	   So you see, all of that science you learn in school can be put to good use! Often, you need only to look closely at something to see the science that makes it work. As in the case of the onion, you just might be able to keep yourself from shedding too many tears! 
	Its so easy to forget the simple things in life, like what it feels like to swing on a swing, or to watch leaves blowing in the wind. When we grow up and get so busy, its easy to forget how much fun life can be, like how much fun it is to eat a piece of gooey pizza or to make faces in the mirror. Its easy to forget how wonderful it is to let our minds wander and imagine-imagine perhaps what its like to be a dinosaur, or an octopus, or even a mermaid gliding through the sea. 	   There is a way to help us remember these joys of childhood, the fun, silly, imaginary things that were once such a big part of our lives: to read childrens poetry. Childrens poetry is not just for children. Its for anyone who knows how special it is to be and to feel like a child.  	   We invite you now to begin exploring for yourself the delightfulness of childrens poetry. The following are two selections from A Childs Garden of Verses by Robert Louis Stevenson. 
	   Imagine there is a bank that credits your account each morning with $86,400. It carries over no balance from day to day. Every evening it deletes whatever part of the balance you failed to use during the day. What would you do? Draw out every cent, of course! 	   Each of us has such a bank. Its name is TIME. Every morning, it credits you with 86,400 seconds. Every night it writes off, as lost, whatever of this you have failed to invest to good purpose. It carries over no balance. It allows no overdraft. Each day it opens a new account for you. Each night it burns the remains of the day. If you fail to use the days deposits, the loss is yours. There is no going back. There is no drawing against the tomorrow. You must live in the present on todays deposits. Invest it so as to get from it the utmost in health, happiness and success! The clock is running. Make the most of today.  To realize the value of ONE YEAR, ask a student who failed a grade.  To realize the value of ONE MONTH, ask a mother who gave birth to a premature baby.  To realize the value of ONE WEEK, ask the editor of a weekly newspaper.  To realize the value of ONE DAY, ask a daily laborer with kids to feed.  To realize the value of ONE HOUR, ask the lovers who are waiting to meet.  To realize the value of ONE MINUTE, ask a person who missed the train.  To realize the value of ONE SECOND, ask a person who just avoided an accident.  To realize the value of ONE MILLISECOND1, ask the person who won a silver medal in the     Olympics. 	   Treasure every moment that you have! And treasure it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time with. And remember that time waits for no one. 	   Yesterday is history. 	   Tomorrow is a mystery. 	   Today is a gift-thats why its called the present!
