 　　Why do you need to learn English? Well, why not? Don’t you want to read your favorite English novel instead of waiting for its Chinese translation? Wouldn’t you like to have a common means of communication with people anywhere in the world? Yes! Of course! Besides, using English well makes you feel good and look cool.  It lets you stand tall.  That’s why you are among the one billion English learners on this planet. 　　English is one of the most commonly used languages in the world. Over one-third of the world’s population speaks it to some degree. About seventy-five countries use it as the major language of government, education, and business. English is also the number one foreign language in most of the other countries. 　　We can hardly imagine life without English. English is the main language of books, the news media, sports, pop music＊, science, air-traffic control＊, and international business. Three-quarters of the world’s mail is in English, and ninety percent of the information on the Internet is also in English. 　　As a widely used language, English is in fact very “international.” It has borrowed many words from other languages in the world. For example, “sugar,” “zero,” “coffee,” and “orange” are from Arabic*; “banana,” “jazz,” and “zebra” from African* languages; “tsunami*,” “karaoke*,” and “sushi*” from Japanese*. And from Chinese, we can find the words “tea” and “ketchup*.” 　　Thus, if you want to connect with the world, English would be your best choice. As a famous language researcher, David Crystal*, once said, “You don’t need long arms to embrace* the world; you need English.” 
﻿ 　　I still remember the night before my first day of high school. I wanted to look perfect on the first day. After I made sure everything was ready for the next day, I happily went to sleep. 　　The next morning, I woke up and felt excited, and I ran to the mirror. When I saw myself in it, I let out a cry, “Oh my God! How could this happen?” Right on the tip* of my nose was a huge red zit! 　　I was surprised and upset. I thought that the zit must have been the work of mean little aliens! They came to Earth and landed their bright red spaceship* right on my nose in order to ruin my first day of high school! It was terrible to have a nose so ugly that it made Rudolph’s* nose look normal. I felt so embarrassed. 　　I tried to hide my ugly pimple*, but nothing I did worked. I wanted to skip school, but my mom wouldn’t let me. I worried that people at school would see my zit and know me not as the “freshman It girl*,” but as the “freshman Zit girl!” It was so depressing! 　　Fortunately, the day went well, and miraculously* no one said anything about my pimple! But for the rest of the year, I was sure that everyone was talking about my funny-looking zit every day when I was not around. 　　On the first day of tenth grade, I guessed that no one remembered my old zit anymore and said to my best friend, “It’s great for me to be off to such a good start this year.” 　　She replied, “I don’t understand.” 　　I pointed at my nose and yelled, “Don’t you remember the huge zit I had on the first day of school last year?” 　　She said, “No, but you must remember my disgusting orange shirt.” 　　I paused and then said, “No, I don’t.” 　　Then I realized that most people only care about their own faults and have no time to think about others’. I can recall all of my embarrassing moments in high school, but even when I try, I can’t remember any such moments of my friends’. Now the zit story has become just a funny memory to me. It has taught me to be more carefree and to wash my face more often!  
﻿ 　　For 9% of the people in the world, it is natural to live their lives mainly using the right hand. They use their right hand to write and draw. They use it to hold chopsticks and forks, toothbrushes, and remote controls*. They also use it to play basketball and Wii*. 　　There are, however, people who prefer to reach out to the world with their left hand. These left-handed people face a lot of difficulties. They have a hard time writing from left to right. They also look awkward when they use scissors. That’s why left-handedness was once thought of as being abnormal and sometimes even a disease. But, in fact, left-handed people are normal and healthy. They can also be very outstanding. For example, da Vinci* and Napoleon* were both left-handers, and so is the popular singer Wang Leehom*. 　　As for the causes of left-handedness, some scientists think it comes from one’s parents. Others say it comes from hormones*. Actually, the main causes are still unknown. Fortunately, people are now more aware of their left-handed friends out there. There are tools made for the safety and convenience of left-handed people. The designs of doors, desks, and computer mouses are more friendly to them. Special shops and websites can also be found for left-handers. In England, there is even a piano for the left-handed. The keyboard and pedals are reversed*! 　　There is one way the public can show thoughtfulness to lefthanders, which is to say “Happy Left-Handers’ Day!” every August 1. Who knows? It’s possible that people might even meet their Mr. or Ms. “Right” while they are celebrating the uniqueness of a left-handed friend on this special day. But a person should be careful when he or she greets a left-handed friend with a friendly hug or a polite kiss on the cheek. Their heads might bump into each other! 
Using Politically Correct English. 	If you dont want to offend someone, you had better know which English words to use---and which to avoid.  	Imagine that you are in a restaurant in America. You want some water, so you call out, Waitress!  A waitress comes to your table, but she looks a little irritated. What did you do wrong? You may have offended her by calling her a waitress.  Today many people prefer the word server to waiter or waitress. Why? As society changes, so does our language. Today the word server is considered more politically correct (or PC) by many people. Politically correct English is an attempt to make language more respectful to all people. 	 	Words that put too much emphasis on gender are slowly being taken away from the English vocabulary. They include words that end in ess or man.  For example, many women who serve passengers on airplanes now prefer to be called flight attendants, not stewardesses.  In the past, only women could be flight attendants. But today, many men have entered the profession, too. Flight attendant is a better word, because it includes both men and women. And many women are entering jobs that were once only occupied by men. So words like policeman are being replaced. Now police officer is the preferred term. 	The use of pronouns is another problem. Unfortunately, English has no gender-neutral singular pronoun that can be used to replace he or she.  This creates problems for advocates of PC English. How do you treat both genders fairly without such a pronoun? People sometimes say, If a person wants to learn English, he should study every day.  In this sentence, he is supposed to mean he or she. But studies show that when people read the word he, they visualize only a male. So to treat both genders fairly, people change he to they and make the sentence plural: If people want to learn English, they should study every day.    PC English goes beyond gender. It also includes issues of race and disabilities. For example, some people prefer the term person with a disability to handicapped.  The word handicapped can be considered disrespectful because it implies that a person is helpless. Changing ones language takes time, however, and some non-PC words are still frequently heard and used. But if you dont want to offend someone, its best to try to avoid these words. 	Some people think PC English has gone too far. They dont like being told what words they have to use. And they dont like changing their speech, just to make others feel better. But most people agree that using respectful language is fair. So they simply change with the times. 
﻿Have you ever thought about what famous people from the past were like in real life? What did people who met them think about them? The following are the stories about three famous people.  My Father Isn’t That Rich. This is a story about the millionaire, John D. Rockefeller2, and was told by a friend of his.  This friend said that though Rockefeller gave away millions, he was known for being very stingy about small sums of money.  One day he went to a hotel in New York City. When he arrived, he asked for the cheapest room they had.  When the manager gave him a room, Rockefeller said, “Is that the cheapest room you have?  I’m staying here by myself and only need a small room."   The manager said, “That room is the smallest and the cheapest one we have,” and added, “but why are you taking such a cheap room?  When your son stays here, he always takes our most expensive room; yours is the cheapest one we’ve got.”  “Yes,” said Rockefeller, “but his father is a wealthy man; mine isn’t.” Something for Everybody. One day Abraham Lincoln was ill and did not want to listen to people asking him for jobs.  Just as one of these men came for a long interview, the President’s doctor happened to enter the room.  Lincoln asked him, “Doctor, what are these red spots on my hands?” “That’s mild smallpox. It is very contagious.” Lincoln’s visitor got up at this point and said, “Well, I need to leave now. I just came to see how you were.  I’ll come again.” Then he headed for the door in a hurry. “There’s one good thing about this,” said Lincoln as the man left,  “I now have something to give everybody.” Mark Twain ’s Absent-mindedness. The famous American writer Mark Twain was well-known for his absent-mindedness. One day, when he was riding on a train, the conductor asked him for his ticket.  Mark Twain looked for the ticket in all his pockets but without success.  However, the conductor knew the writer by sight, and said, “It doesn’t really matter. Show me your ticket on your way back.   And if you don’t find it, there’s no harm done." "Oh, but I must find the darned thing; otherwise, how will I know where I’m going?" From the stories above, you can see that, despite their different professions, the three famous people all had one thing in common: a great sense of humor. Obviously they were able to amuse others and be amused, and to bring joy to all.
@@When my son Joey was born, his feet were twisted1 upward2 with the bottoms resting on his tummy1. It meant that Joey had been born with club feet2. The doctors assured3 us that with treatment4 he would be able to walk normally, but would probably never run very well. @@If he walked great distances, like at the amusement parks3, he complained5 that his legs were tired and that they hurt. We would stop walking, take a break, and talk about what we had seen. We did not tell him why his legs hurt and why they were weak. We did not tell him this was expected6 because his body had a problem ever since he was born. We did not tell him, so he did not know. @@The children in our neighborhood7 ran around as most children do during play. Joey would jump right in and run and play, too. We never told him that he probably would not be able to run as well as the other children. We did not tell him he was different. So he did not know. In seventh grade, he decided to go out for the cross-country4 team. Every day he trained with the team. He seemed to work harder. Perhaps he sensed that the abilities8 that seemed to come naturally to so many others did not come naturally to him. We did not tell him that he should not expect to make the team. The runners9 chosen for the team were the top seven runners of the school. We did not tell him, so he did not know. @@I will never forget the time he had a 39-degree10 Celsius5 fever11. He would not stay home because he had cross-country practice. I worried about him all day. I expected to get a call from the school asking me to come get him and take him home. No one called.  @@I went out to the training area after school. I thought that if I were there, he might decide to skip12 practice that evening. I pulled up alongside13 him and drove slowly to keep pace14 with him as he ran. I asked how he felt. Okay, he said. As the sweat15 rolled16 down his face, his eyes were glassy17 from his fever. Yet he looked straight ahead18 and kept running. We never told him he could not run four miles with a 39-degree Celsius fever. So he did not know.  @@Two weeks later, the names of the runners picked for the team were called. Joey was number six on the list. He was in seventh grade. The other six team members19 were all eighth graders20. We never told him he probably should not expect to make the team. We never told him he could not do it. So he did not know. He just did it. 
Unit 4  Tips for Improving Your Memory.      Study shows that most problems with memory grow out of bad habits. For example, if you develop the habit of not making an effort to remember things, your ability to memorize will begin to decrease. On the other hand, a good memory can be the result of good habits. To improve your memory, you should change the way you deal with information.      Here are some tips that may assist you in getting on the right track. Set realistic goals. @@Do not expect to remember everything. If you have memory problems in particular areas, focus on them first. After you have achieved some success in those areas, move on to others.Stay mentally active. @@Exercising your mind is the best way to keep it sharp. If you tend to avoid mental challenges and always choose the easiest solutions, it will become difficult for you to depend on your memory to solve challenging problems.Cut down on activities that dont require you to think. @@Watching TV is an activity that most people do too much. Many TV programs require no mental input at all. The more time you spend on these programs, the more easily you pick up the habit of turning off your brain.Read more. @@Reading provides one of the best ways to exercise your brain. Whether you are busy working or studying, you should spare some time to read. When you read, you have to actively use your memory to recognize words and arrange them into phrases, then sentences, and then ideas. The more often you read, the more mental workouts you get.Get into the habit of taking notes. @@Whether you are reading, studying, or listening to a speech, it is useful to write down the information you may want to look up later. In the process of writing down what is mentioned, you are actually organizing information, which often helps you to recall it better.Try something unfamiliar. @@You should occasionally try new things or learn something that interests youXand not just try to get high scores on exams. Learn a new sport, a musical instrument, or a new language. Your brain may grow lazy if you dont exercise it with new activities every now and then.Teach others what you know. @@Teaching others helps you strengthen your knowledge by forcing you to think about the reasons and connections concerning the information you are sharing.      Many people who have practiced the tips above have noticed great improvements in their memories. However, everyone is unique, and the results may vary from person to person. What matters more than these tips is to find out what works best for you. XAdapted from Tips on Improving Your Memory. 
Unit 5  Blame It on the Brain.      Jim and I got into another fight over the mess he made in the living room again! I was trembling with rage after he told me to stop nagging. With his arms crossed, he said that he had been stressed out and needed some silence. I stood still next to the sofa and waited for an apology from him. However, I almost hit the roof because he just sat there and kept changing channels.      Shortly afterward I called my best friend Nicole to complain about it, but she only laughed and said, Oh, just give Jim a break. Men and women are different. Its almost like theyre from different planets. Actually, Ive learned a lot about men from two famous relationship experts. One is Mark Gungor, and the other is Dr. Amen. Frankly, at first I wasnt going to believe anything Nicole said about those experts. In my eyes, relationship experts only choose facts that support their theories, I said.      However, after speaking with Nicole, I went online and watched some clips of these experts. They talked humorously about gender differences, and they both communicated one important messageXmens and womens brains simply work differently. According to Gungor, there are many small boxes in mens brains, and one of them is named the Nothing Box. When men are under stress, they go to the Nothing Box to relax. Thus, it is not necessary for most men to talk about their problems with friends. Gungors claim amazed me because sharing feelings is so important to women, especially when were in bad moods. I couldnt wait to learn more!      After viewing some more clips, I had learned a lot about Dr. Amens brain scans of both sexes. On the whole, women have larger and more active emotional centers than men do. In other words, women are more likely to be affected by emotions than men are. I couldnt help but have a chuckle. No wonder every time Jim and I have a quarrel, I always cry in the end. Amen also adds that since mens brains are less active, men need more excitement and stimulation. For that reason, they may unconsciously keep surfing channels for something new and different. Well, I guessed I would have to forgive Jim for always doing that.      I turned off the computer and stepped back into the living room. Much to my surprise, the living room had been tidied up! A thought struck meXmaybe it is true that men and women come from different planets, but fortunately, my husband attempted to bridge the gap. Though Jim never said he was sorry, he apologized in his own way. That night, Jim hugged me with his head tilting toward me as we watched TV. XJason Crockett 
Unit 6  Lets Dig In!      Fried insects are regarded as a delicious dish in some parts of the worldXjust as roast mice make a perfect meal in other parts. Many of us, however, would turn down these foods. Similarly, horse meat that is served as a delicacy in certain areas of France might never be acceptable to most Americans, even those who are so hungry that they could eat a horse.      What makes people choose certain foods over others, then? After digging into this issue, experts have discovered several factors. Among these factors, customs as well as traditions are the major ones, and so is geography.      Customs and traditions play important roles in peoples choices of foods. In Japan, lobster is considered essential for a birthday meal because a lobster looks like an aged person with a hunched back. Another example of this can be found in Greece. On New Years Day, Greeks bake a special type of bread containing a coin made of silver or gold. The person who finds the coin in his or her piece of bread will be blessed with good luck for the coming year.      Likewise, on Chinese New Years Eve, many Chinese gather around the table with their family members to make and eat dumplings. A dumpling looks like a yuanbao, which was a type of money used in ancient China. A yuanbao represents wealth and satisfaction in Chinese culture. Therefore, many believe that making dumplings is helpful in making more money, and so is eating dumplings. This is one of the things that Chinese people do to try to insure a prosperous year.      In addition to customs and traditions, geography is another important factor that influences peoples food choices. Take millet, for example. It is one of Africas main crops because it flourishes in hot climates. This is exactly the reason why millet can also be found in certain Asian countries where the average temperature tends to be high. In contrast, the cold climate close to the North Pole drives the Inuit to get the fat and protein they need from the blubber of whales. The potato is a classic example, too. It is a staple in many peoples diets, especially those who live in mountainous areas with poor soil. The potato adapts itself well to different climates; therefore, it is often grown in many European countries, and is even thought of as second bread.      In most cases, people choose to eat some foods and not to eat other foods for specific understandable reasons. Actually, complex factors often lead to different food choices. Keep this in mind if you have the opportunity to visit Sweden and taste soured herring. Better still, try to find out the origin of this Swedish specialty. What you discover may keep you from losing your appetiteXif you are able to put up with its unique smell! XGail Sharpe. Adapted from Why We Eat What We Eat. 
	At the top of a three-story brick building in Greenwich Village, where many artists lived, Sue and Joanna had their studio. They had met at a restaurant and found their tastes in art, food, and fashion so similar that they decided to become roommates.     That was in May. In November the cold, wet weather brought sickness to the neighborhood where the two women lived, and Joanna became very ill with pneumonia. She lay on her bed, looking through the window at the side of the next brick house. 	One morning the doctor spoke to Sue. She has one chance in ten, he said. And that chance will come only if she wants to live. Your friend has made up her mind that shes not going to get well. When a patient9 begins to think that way, there is little that medicine can do. 	After the doctor had gone, Sue cried and cried. Finally she walked into Joannas room and found her lying on the bed with her eyes wide open. She was looking out the window and counting backward. Twelve, she said, eleven, ten, nine,.... The leaves on the ivy vine are falling faster now. There are only five left. When the last one falls, I must go, too. Im tired of waiting. I want to let go of everything, and go sailing down, down, just like one of those poor leaves. 	Oh, I have never heard of such nonsense, complained Sue. Try to sleep. I must go talk to Mr. Behrman. 	Old Mr. Behrman was a painter who lived beneath them. He was past sixty and was a failure in art. He had always said he was going to paint a masterpiece, but had never begun one. For years he had painted almost nothing, but spent much of his time drinking. He was a fierce old man, yet he was very fond of Sue and Joanna. 	Sue told Behrman what Joanna had said about the leaves. Ah, that poor little Miss Joanna, said Behrman. Some day I will paint a masterpiece. Yes! 	The next morning Sue found Joanna again staring out the window. But, what had happened? Though it had rained heavily the night before, and the wind had blown hard, there yet stood out against the brick wall one ivy leaf. It was the last on the vine.  	I thought it would surely fall during the night, said Joanna. It will fall today, and I shall die at the same time.  	 Yet, as the day passed, and it began to grow dark, the lone ivy leaf clung to its stem against the wall. The next day as well, the ivy leaf was still there. 	Ive been a bad girl, Sue, said Joanna. Something has made that last leaf stay there to show how wrong I was. It is a sin19 to want to die. 	The doctor came in the afternoon and again spoke to Sue. Take care of her, and she will recover. Now I must go and see the old artist downstairs. He has pneumonia, too, but he is an old, weak man. There is no hope for him. 	By the next day, Joanna was out of danger. Sue came to her bed and put one arm around her. @  I have something to tell you, Joanna,she said. Mr. Behrman died of pneumonia today. He became sick two days ago. When someone found him in his room, his shoes and clothing were wet through and icy cold. They couldnt imagine where he had been on such a dreadful night. And then they found a lantern, a ladder, and some brushes and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed on it. Darling, look out the window at the leaf on the wall. Didnt you wonder why it never moved when the wind blew? Its Behrmans masterpiece-he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell.
