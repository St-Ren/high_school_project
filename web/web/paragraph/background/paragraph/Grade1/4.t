 　　John and Robert were both seriously ill, and they shared the same hospital room. John’s bed was next to the room’s only window. He could sit up in his bed to help drain the water from his lungs*. Robert, however, had to spend all his time lying flat on his back. The men did not have much to do, so they chatted for hours on end about everything, including their families, their professions, and even their military service. 　　Every afternoon when John was sitting up, he would tell Robert about the things outside the window. He said that the window overlooked a park with a lovely lake. There were ducks swimming on the water and groups of children sailing their toy boats. Young couples strolled arm in arm among the trees and flowers, and mountains could be seen in the distance. With John’s description, Robert could imagine the greatest views that he saw before he was put into hospital. Although John’s health was worsening, he never stopped sharing these wonderful sights with his roommate. 　　Days and weeks passed. One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths but discovered that John was dead in his sleep. Sadly, she asked someone to take him away. 　　As soon as he had enough energy, Robert asked the nurse to move him next to the window. The nurse was glad to help him, and left the room after she made sure that he was comfortable. Slowly, Robert lifted himself up on one elbow* to take his first look at the real world outside. But as he turned to look out the window, he couldn’t believe his eyes. He found that the window faced nothing but a plain brick wall. Robert called the nurse. “Where are all the interesting people and things John told me about?” he asked. 　　The nurse seemed surprised. “Didn’t you know that John was blind?” she asked. Robert was too shocked to say a word. “Perhaps he just wanted to help you,” the nurse said. 
﻿ 　　For many people around the world, the first bicycle they ever rode was probably a Giant bicycle. A Giant bicycle is not an oversized* bike designed for extremely large people, but a bike made by Taiwan’s Giant Manufacturing Co., Ltd*. 　　There is a saying, “Once you learn how to ride a bike, you never forget.” Company chairperson* King Liu* has never forgotten how to ride a bike! At the age of seventy-three, Mr. Liu circled Taiwan on a 1-day journey called “Ride Life.” He experienced Taiwan’s culture, food, and people along the way on his bicycle. 　　“Driving is too quick; it doesn’t allow you to see anything,” Liu said. “And walking is too slow. Indeed, cycling is the best way to experience the beauty of the island.” Liu encouraged people to experience a “Ride Life” as he did. “Life is more exciting if it is experienced on a bicycle,” he said. 　　When Giant started business over thirty years ago, bicycles were used mainly for transportation. Through the years, however, Giant has made a great effort to promote the concept of “Ride Life.” In this effort, Giant has set up bicycle rental* services in some big cities. This helps spread the popularity of cycling as a leisure activity. As a result, more and more people in Taiwan are now seeking a healthier lifestyle* through cycling. 　　Giant is quite different from other companies. Years ago, many companies gave up or changed over to making other products. But Giant stayed with what they believed in—bicycles. Now Giant is one of the largest and most successful bike producers in the world. But its officials are not satisfied with that. They want people to protect the environment by driving less. They also hope that everyone can experience life in a fun and healthy way. It is no wonder that Giant deserves to be a giant in the bicycle world! 
﻿ 　　One day during the Vietnam War*, a bomb dropped in the yard of an orphanage*. The explosion killed several children, and wounded several others. Soon an American doctor arrived with a nurse, and they began to perform first aid* on the wounded kids. However, one little girl had already bled too much, and she needed a blood transfusion* as soon as possible. The doctor asked the other children to donate blood to the dying girl, for she hadn’t brought enough bags of blood. 　　First, the doctor gave everyone a blood test and found five children with the right blood type. However, the doctor and the nurse could not speak much Vietnamese*, while the orphanage workers and kids could not speak English. With the help of gestures, the doctor told the children, “Your friend is bleeding badly. She needs your blood!” The kids nodded their heads and seemed to understand. But then one began to look very nervous, another started to cry, and still another closed her eyes and shook her head. 　　No one raised a hand to volunteer. The doctor was surprised. Why wouldn’t they give some blood to save their friend? Didn’t they understand what she had said? At last, one of the kids slowly raised his hand and then backed out quickly. But a moment later, he raised his hand again, and this time he didn’t put it down. The doctor breathed a sigh of relief and made the little boy lie on the makeshift* examination table. As the needle penetrated* his skin and began to draw blood out of his skinny arm, the boy lay there stiff* with tears rolling down his cheeks. The doctor asked if he was in pain. He shook his head but didn’t stop crying. The doctor was confused. She felt that something had gone wrong, though she didn’t know what. But she was certain that the problem was not the needle. 　　Just when the doctor began to panic, a Vietnamese nurse arrived on the scene. The doctor told her about the situation. The nurse bent over and whispered something in the boy’s ear, and soon he stopped crying. He even began to smile! 　　It turned out that all the children had misunderstood the doctor. They thought she would drain them of all their blood to save the little girl. The doctor finally understood why nobody except this boy was willing to give blood, and why he was weeping. But now she wondered why he was willing to give blood even when he thought he would surely die.  　　The Vietnamese nurse asked the boy the question. This time he responded without hesitation. He said, “Because she is my best friend.” 
﻿     I am an astronaut* working in the International Space Station*. My daily routine is quite unique because I work 2 miles above the Earth, where the gravity* is close to zero─the so-called “microgravity*.” My main jobs are doing scientific experiments, changing machine parts and keeping the spaceship clean, and I carry out all of them while floating in the air! Microgravity not only adds a twist to my work, but also makes other aspects of my daily life different from that of other scientists down on Earth.     Food is as important in space as it is on Earth. Yet most of us experience loss of appetite at the beginning of our days in space because our bodies are trying to get used to a completely new environment. Besides, food doesn’t taste as good up here, so seasonings* such as salt and pepper are a nice addition to space meals. But they must come in liquid form rather than in the form of powders, which may float around and get stuck in the vents*.     Exercise is another must-do. Our muscles don’t need to support our bodies, which weigh nothing in microgravity, so they may shrink. To prevent our muscles from shrinking, we need to exercise two hours a day on specially designed bikes and running machines, or do weight training by pulling tight ropes that are fixed to the wall on one end.     After our stomachs are full and exercise is completed, we need to clean ourselves before bedtime. The idea that we take showers every day doesn’t work here. The supply of water is limited, so we only take showers from time to time. They are taken inside a large plastic capsule* so that no water gets away. After the shower, we turn on a machine that sucks up all the water. On no-shower days, we clean our skin with wet towels or a special soap that doesn’t need to be washed off.     After many hours of work, there is nothing like a nice, long rest. To avoid floating around, we shut ourselves in a special space about the size of a phone booth*, and attach our sleeping bags to the wall. This way, we won’t bump into each other in our sleep, or wake up in the restroom!     Living in space is a unique experience. Having gone through hundreds of hours of simulation* during training down on Earth, we are still amazed when we first get up here. In fact, the feeling of amazement never really goes away. Living and working like this is sometimes difficult, but most of the time it is enjoyable!

Can Dogs Talk?      Can you understand your dog? Can your dog understand you? Some people say the answer is yes to both questions. In Germany, researchers studied a dog that could understand more than 200 words. In Tokyo, a company invented a device called the Bow-Lingual. This device can translate a dogs bark into words. The Bow-Lingual is becoming very popular. In fact, now you can get one in different languages all over the world!      Rico, a nine-year-old dog in Germany, knew the names of over 200 toys. In an experiment, the researchers put a new toy together with seven of Ricos old toys in a room. Then they told Rico to get the new toy, calling that toy by its new name. Rico understood the order and finished the task 7 out of 10 times. One month later, they did the experiment again, and Rico still remembered the name of the new toy. Thus, according to the researchers, a dog can hear and learn new words just like a child.      Dogs can listen to and understand their owners, but can their owners understand them? The Bow-Lingual Dog Translator may be able to help. The Bow-Lingual is a small device with a microphone. You can attach the microphone to your dogs collar. When your dog barks, the Bow-Lingual records the sound. Then it translates the sound into six emotions: happy, sad, watchful, frustrated, needy, and confident. After it translates the sound into an emotion, it matches the emotion with common phrases which fit your dogs emotional state. These include This bone is delicious, I feel great, and Lets go, etc. This device helps everyone understand dogs. Understanding dogs language is a great help in knowing what is wrong with a dog if he has a health problem, and also in dog training.        With the help of the Bow-Lingual Translator, Dr. Dolittles dream of talking with animals is no longer a fantasy. As long as there is a need for pet-owner communication, there will probably be more new inventions. The Bow-Lingual is so popular that soon there may be one for cats, too. Of course, it will be the Meow-Lingual. --from Read on 3, by Nancy Nici Mare, reprinted with permission of The McGraw-Hill Companies 
The Power of Advertising. @@Advertising is everywhere. Do you know how it affects you? @@Advertising messages bombard you from everywhere. You see them or hear them every time you turn on the TV or listen to the radio. Whenever you open a newspaper or surf the Internet, theyre there, too. Ads cover billboards, sides of buses and buildings. Its impossible to count the number of advertisements you see every day. One organization in America tried. The organization estimated that by the time Americans are sixty-five, they have seen two million TV commercials. Add other advertising to that, and you realize just how many ads people see.  @@Advertising tries to convince you to buy a particular product or service. Some ads are so creative and persuasive that you cant help buying the product! The more often you see an ad, the more familiar you become with the product. You find yourself remembering the slogans, catchphrases and jingles of advertisements. When you do, you may be more likely to buy those products. Does it work? You bet! @@Companies pay a lot of money to advertising firms to think up catchy phrases that people cant get out of their heads. Even years later, people remember the slogans and jingles. American Express credit cards remind you to Never leave home without it. McDonalds wants you to think Im lovin it when you eat their sandwiches. Pepsi belongs to Generation Next And Nike wants consumers to Just do it. The power of advertising cant be underestimated, especially on children. By the time children are six, they know two hundred brand names. They will be loyal to many of them for life.  @@In advertising, slogans and jingles sell products and so do famous faces. Companies think you will use their products if celebrities tell you they do. As a result, companies pay millions of dollars to sports stars, pop stars and movie stars to endorse their products. Nicole Kidman promotes Chanel No. 5 perfume. Tiger Woods drives a Buick, and Celine Dion, a Chrysler. Even Jackie Chan wants you to wear Hanes T-shirts just like he does. @@Whatever method they use, advertisements are meant to encourage you to buy products. They want to convince you that their product will make you happier or better looking. Think about the people you see in ads. Almost all of them are attractive and are usually smiling. But the subtle message that things make you happy simply isnt true. If you believe it, youll end up spending more and more money. Youll find yourself searching for the elusive happiness the ads promise but the products dont deliver. @@People need to know how advertisers use images and language to get them to buy their products. After seeing an ad, people should think critically. They should ask questions such as the following: What ways are used to get my attention? What values and points of view are presented in the message? Do I need this product? Thinking critically about an advertisement will reduce the pressure to buy. You may have to look at advertisements, but you dont have to buy what they sell.  
Friends.      What is a friend? A friend is many things: someone who can share our joys and our sorrows, someone who will laugh at our jokes and wipe away our tears, someone who will help us to find success and to overcome failure. A friend will walk by our side when we are lonely, and will step aside when we need room to grow.      A friend is someone we can depend upon in good times and bad times.  It is someone who is always there, even when we are miles away. A friend is someone who will always tell us the truth, and who wants to hear the truth from us.  It is someone with whom we can always be ourselves.      The following poems offer some more ideas about friends. Reading them, you will probably find yourself thinking about the special friends in your own life. New Friends and Old Friends by Joseph Parry Make new friends, but keep the old; Those are silver, these are gold. New-made friendships, like new wine, Age will mellow and refine. Friendships that have stood the testX  Time and changeXare surely best; Brow may wrinkle, hair grow gray; Friendship never knows decay. For mid old friends, tried and true, Once more we our youth renew. But old friends, alas! may die; New friends must their place supply. Cherish friendship in your breastX New is good, but Old is best; Make new friends, but keep the old; Those are silver, these are gold. Friends By Jan Anderson The friends of our childhood, the friends of our past We think of them fondly from first to last: As children they were our playmates; As students they were our classmates. But through the years some are forgotten and move away As each has gone his own separate way. But others become our friends for life They always share our triumphs and strife. They urge us on when we want to quit; They are the ones well never forget. Even when we get older, independent and bolder, Sometimes our life becomes lonely and colder, And we need to cry on a true friends shoulder Friends give us comfort when we are sad, Correct us with love when we are bad, Calm us down when we are mad, And give us new hope to make us glad. At every stage of life we always need friends, For on them much joy in our life depends. 
Feeding the World in the Future. @@Today there are six billion people on earth. By the year 2050 there may be as many as 12.5 billion, which is a lot of people to feed. Can farmers all over the world provide enough food for everyone?  @@The Western world's answer to the question is to use technology to produce food more quickly. This approach has been very successful. Since 1961, farmers in the West have produced nearly a quarter more food per person, and they have produced it at a cost 40 percent lower than before. The foods they are producing include wheat, corn, and rice. These are important because they represent half of all the food we eat in the world. @@One way to produce more food is by growing stronger plants. For thousands of years, farmers have tried to make their crops stronger. Every season, they pick the strongest and healthiest plants for the next season. But this method works very slowly. Since 1983, however, scientists have been able to develop stronger plants more quickly by changing their genetic material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods, or GM foods. These GM foods, many people believe, are the best answer to feeding the worlds growing population. @@Some GM plants may have other advantages as well. They may also be able to help fight human diseases. A kind of rice is being developed, for example, which may help prevent some people from going blind. 	GM foods are being welcomed by both rich and poor countries. Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and because they can bring in more money. Poor countries are interested in them because they can be used to feed many people. China is already growing thousands of hectares of GM foods, and African countries are beginning to grow them as well. @@However, GM plants are not perfect. Many people believe they are unnatural. Some even think they could harm us. In one experiment, genetic material from a snowdrop, a kind of flower, was added to a potato plant to help the plant fight disease. The potatoes were later fed to rats and the rats became ill. Did they become ill because of the GM food they ate? No one knows for sure. No one knows how good or bad these foods may be for human beings. @@There is another problem with GM plants. They are not built to live through all kinds of changes. The weather and climate can change, for example. Sometimes, a whole crop of wheat may fail if the winter suddenly becomes very cold. New diseases can also occur, and farmers may lose all of their plants to such diseases.  @@Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050. There are strong feelings against them because they are unnatural. They may feed people, and then hurt them or their children later. But both rich and poor countries are very interested in their use, and they are not going to go away. In 2050 we may think differently about them. 
﻿I learned most of what I really need to know about belief and living in kindergarten. Wisdom is as important at the top of the graduate school4 mountain as it is in the sandbox1 at nursery school2.  These are the things I learned: Share everything. Play fair5. Don’t hit people. Put things back where you found them. Clean up your own mess6. Don’t take things that aren’t yours. Say you’re sorry when you hurt somebody. Wash your hands before you eat. Flush7. Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you. Live a balanced8 life. Learn some, think some, draw, and paint some. Sing, dance, play, and work some every day.  Take a nap9 every afternoon. When you go outside, watch for traffic, hold hands, and stick10 together. Be aware11 of wonder12. Remember the little seed13 in the plastic14 cup. The roots15 go down and the plant16 goes up. Nobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that.   Goldfish, hamsters3, white mice, and even the little seed in the plastic cup─they all die. So do we. 	And then remember the book about Dick and Jane4 and the first word you learned, the biggest word of all: LOOK. Everything you need to know is in there somewhere. The Golden17 Rule5, love, basic18 cleanliness6, ecology7, politics19, and sensible20 living─you name it.   Think of what a better world it will be if we all─the whole21 world─have cookies and milk at  three o’clock every afternoon and then lie22 down with our blankets23 for a nap. Also think of what if we would always put things back where we found them and clean up our own messes. And it is still true; no matter how old you are, when you go outside, it is best to hold hands and stick together. While24 what I learned in kindergarten is much more basic than what I learned in graduate school, the lessons are no less important. 
﻿Like many other universities, Monsters University has everything you need in an American university. It holds its teachers and students to high standards that require1 all of them to work hard. But this is not an ordinary2 university. It is a university that trains its students to become professional “scarers3,” whose goals are set upon getting energy from human screams3.  　　Monsters University2 is a 2013 3-D animated4 comedy5 produced by Pixar Animation4 Studios3, an American computer animation film6 studio based in Emeryville4, California5. The success of the 2001 hit, Monsters, Inc.6, motivated7 the Studio to film6 this 2013 prequel7. Monsters University tells the story of how its heroes8, Mike and Sulley, meet in university and later become workers of Monsters, Inc., a successful power company9 in the monster world, whose workers generate their city’s power by scaring human children. Inspired10 by his childhood tour to the Monsters, Inc., Mike plans to become a professional scarer. He is admitted11 to the university and begins his new adventure12.  　　 Mike studies hard while his roommate, a talented13 monster Sulley, tends to rely14 on his natural ability15. In the middle of the school year, both of them do poorly in studies and school activities16. They fail the test for SCARE 1018, and they will drop out of school when the school year ends. To prove17 himself, Mike enters the school’s Scare Games and teams up with Sulley, a lazy student and a cheater9. Though the team fails the first challenge, they finally win the final test.  　　Later, Mike discovers18 that Sulley cheats in the game. To prove his ability of being a powerful scarer, Mike breaks into a school lab10 and enters a door that leads him to the human world. His human adventure in a summer camp turns out to be a disaster19 because he fails to scare the human children. Later he is joined by Sulley in the human world. However, they are trapped by Dean11 Hardscrabble, who closes the door to the human world. When they realize that the only way to get back into the monster world is to generate enough scream energy, Mike and Sulley finally work together to scare the adults20. They generate a huge amount of scream energy and get back to their own world.  　　This is a story of friendship and teamwork12. Mike says in the movie, “You and I are a team. Nothing is more important than our friendship.” Though they complain21 about each other, they both always believe that they are the best team. “I wouldn’t have nothin’ if I didn’t have you,” says Mike.  　　This is also a story about two different kinds of people, a hard-working one and a talented one. Who will win in the end? Not a smart student, Mike has to work hard and fumble13 along the way; yet, without Mike’s help, the talented Sulley will never get to his aim. As a team, two of them can generate great power and energy, which would open any door to any place they want to be. Using state-of-the-art14 technology22, Pixar not only creates23 a fantasy15 3-D movie for kids; it also uses its funny monsters to teach its young audience24 a great lesson.  
@@Today Sally Oh1, a reporter, is interviewing a successful advertising2 agency3 executive4, Amy Baines2, who uses the Internet at work to watch her 3-year-old son Harry while he is at day care. 	Sally:	Tell us about your work and about Harrys schedule5 while youre at work. 	Amy:	I start work at 9:00 and finish at 6:00. I work all week, and sometimes I have to travel. Harry is at the day-care center from 8:30 until 6:30. Its a long day for both of us.  	Sally:	And you can keep in touch with Harry during the day? 	Amy:	Thats right. 	Sally:	How do you get to see Harry during the day? 	Amy:	The day-care center has a video camera that is connected to a special website6. When I want to see him, I can call up the website and see the center on my computer screen7. 	Sally:	How does that make you feel? 	Amy:	Wonderful. For example, when I dropped Harry off at the center yesterday, he started to cry. I had to leave, but he just wouldnt stop crying. I felt bad, but I needed to get to work. Then at work, I was so worried that I couldnt concentrate8. So I logged9 on and went to the website. I could see Harry playing a  game, as happy as could be.  It made me feel better.  What a relief10! I could  concentrate on my  work and had a very  productive11 morning. 	Sally:	Can anyone visit the website? 	Amy:	No. You need a special name and password12 to get into the system13. 	Sally:	Do the day-care workers like it? 	Amy:	At first, they felt self-conscious14. But now, they dont seem to notice. The activity in the day-care center goes on as usual15. 	Sally:	How often do you log on to see your son? 	Amy:	Usually about four or five times a day. I just like to see him and know what kind of day hes having.  	Sally:	Does the camera follow the children everywhere? 	Amy:	Almost everywhere. Its not on in the room where the children take their naps or in the book corner16. But if I log on and dont see him, I can ask his teacher to bring him over into the view of the camera. 	Sally:	Do you consider it good for the day-care center to have such a system? 	Amy:	I think so. Its good because I can check in and find out whether the center is doing good work with Harry. I can see whether he is getting enough attention and if the center is following the educational18 program that they say they offer18. 	Sally:	Are there any other benefits to this system? 	Amy:	Yes. My parents, who live 2,000 miles away, can log on and see their first grandchild19 doing important new things. With the Internet, its as though were living in the same house. @@Sally Oh thanks Amy Baines for the interview. Sally concludes by saying that day-care centers with video cameras linked to websites are good for working parents. These parents can concentrate at work because they know that their children are getting good care thanks to the wonders of technology.

Unit 6  When in Bulgaria, Do as the Bulgarians Do.      On the first day of Mikes trip to Bulgaria, he had his lunch in a local restaurant. After Mike finished his delicious meal, a friendly waitress asked him about his food. Mike spoke very little Bulgarian, so he nodded his head to tell her that he had enjoyed the meal. To his surprise, Mike noticed the waitress frown after his reply. Was there something wrong with the waitressXor with Mike?      The story above shows that even though people throughout the world use body language to communicate without speaking, the meanings of the same gesture can vary widely. A positive gesture in one country can mean something quite different in another. Therefore, it is better for travelers to get to know a countrys culture before they visit it.      In India, for example, people use the head bobble to express their approval. Indians tilt their heads from side to side when they agree with others. This can confuse people who shake their heads from left to right to show disagreement. Some people say that the Indian head bobble grew out of watching snake charming. The snakes move from side to side when they are not going to bite, which means I am of no threat to you. This may offer an explanation for Indians use of the head bobble to express a positive answer.      From time to time, using the wrong gesture in the wrong place can bring about a lot of trouble. In Greece, the gesture of showing ones palm toward someone is called the moutza. This gesture is very insulting and may bring trouble on those people who make it. Thats because Greek criminals faces were covered in ashes (moutzos in Greek) as a punishment in earlier times. The ashes were placed on a criminals face with an open palm, so the gesture itself became insulting. As a result of this tradition, it would be impolite of you to let your palm face outward when you wave goodbye in Greece.      Luckily for Mike, an English-speaking couple who were sitting next to him in the restaurant came to his rescue. They explained that nodding ones head is a negative answer in Bulgaria, while shaking ones head from left to right is a positive one. Mike, thus, realized that he had made a mistake. He called the waitress over, pointed to his plate, and shook his head. By doing so, he hoped that she would bring him some dessert. XJules Crowell. Revised by Jason Crockett. 
Unit 11  The Alternative Nobel Prize.      Having a meal is an easy and delightful process for most people. However, for a woodpecker, its not that simple. What does a woodpecker do to get its dinner? Well, what it has to do is hit its head against a tree dozens of times. Yet, amazingly, it never suffers any ill effects like brain damage, even though it has to peck numerous times per day. According to research, it is the woodpeckers thick head bones that protect it from the impact of the blows. For explaining that, Ivan Schwab won an Ig Nobel Prize for Ornithology.      The Ig Nobel Prizes are organized by The Annals of Improbable Research, an American magazine that celebrates the funny side of science. Each year, ten winners are awarded prizes in honor of their achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think. Most of the award-winning research, like Schwabs, may seem unusual, but it usually grabs peoples attention indeed. And no matter how ridiculous the research sounds, people can find it inspiring and amusing.      With these awards in mind, you might be more interested in Brian Wansinks research. He took home an Ig Nobel Prize for Nutrition for looking into the influence of visual factors on peoples appetites. He used specially designed bowls that refilled themselves with soup while people were eating. Since these people had no idea this was happening, they just kept eating from these bottomless bowls. They said they didnt feel full because their bowls were not empty yet. The results of this research showed that people in this experiment ate 73 percent more soup than normal. Owing to these results, Wansink concluded that its not peoples stomachs that decide when they have eaten enough, but their eyes.      In addition to facts and discoveries that people have never heard of, the Ig Nobel Prizes also give attention to science and technology that is a part of our daily lives. Take the karaoke machine, for example. It was born in 1971, and its inventor Daisuke Inoue was given an Ig Nobel Peace Prize for creating it. Inoue was employed at a nightclub, playing the piano for the customers who wanted to sing. Since he wasnt skillful enough to play all the songs properly, he tried to think of some ways to clear up the problem. Thus, he created the karaoke machine. To Inoues surprise, the machine caused considerable changes in entertainment worldwide. The Ig Nobel Prize was awarded to Inoue not only because his invention was entertaining, but also because it has brought about an entirely new way for people to learn to tolerate each other.      These research results of Ig Nobel Prizes may not be as great as Edisons light bulb or Newtons laws of motion. Nevertheless, they do show peoples willingness to take action and to try new ways to solve problems. It is not about how much a person accomplishes, but about how desperately he or she has tried to achieve something. According to Marc Abrahams, a founder of the Ig Nobel Prizes, if you win one, it signifies that you have done something. XPaul Geraghty
