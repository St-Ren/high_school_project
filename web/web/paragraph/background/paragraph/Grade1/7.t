 　　What is the busiest day of the year for American restaurants? On what day do sales of flowers, chocolate, and greeting cards skyrocket*? What’s one of the busiest times for long-distance telephone calls? When are people most likely to look for traffic information in America and Britain*? Well, it’s Mother’s Day! 　　Mother’s Day seems to be a time when families spend money and have fun nowadays, but this holiday had a very serious meaning in the beginning. It all began with Julia Ward Howe*, a songwriter who was horrified at the death and destruction of the American Civil War*. She called on all mothers to protest the killing of their sons. In 1, Howe proposed an international mother’s day to promote peace. Years later, a woman named Anna Jarvis* also called for an official mother’s day. At her church in West Virginia*, Jarvis handed out carnations* in remembrance of her mother and in honor of peace. Finally, in 1, President Woodrow Wilson* declared that the second Sunday of May would be Mother’s Day, a day to remember the great contributions made by mothers to their families and to society. 　　From then on, people began honoring their mothers by sending cards, flowers, or anything that would please their moms. However, the increasing number of people spending money on gifts greatly upset Anna Jarvis. She hated to see businessmen taking advantage of this holiday to sell gifts and services. Therefore, Jarvis did many things to stop commercial activities held on Mother’s Day. For example, she protested the sale of flowers. She interrupted a meeting of the American War Mothers* and got arrested. And she was not happy with the postage stamp featuring her mother, a vase of white carnations, and the words “Mother’s Day.” All such activities seemed to Anna Jarvis only a misuse of this holiday. 　　Despite the commercialization of the holiday, there are some Mother’s Day customs that are worth mentioning. In Mexico*, a mother is usually treated to a song sung by her family or a hired band. A family breakfast is also customary. In Finland*, a mother is served with breakfast in bed and presented with a bunch of flowers freshly picked in the wild by her family. In Sweden*, the Red Cross* sells small plastic flowers and donates all the money to poor mothers and their children. Most of the activities mentioned above don’t cost a lot, but the love thus shown is the same. 　　So, what are you going to do to show your love for your mom this year? 　　─Based on “Mother’s Day History” ©- MothersDayCentral.com 
﻿　　Mrs. Summon’s* child, Billy, was dying because he had been plagued* by leukemia*. As she watched him, her heart was filled with sadness. Like any parent, she had wanted her son to grow up and fulfill all his dreams. Now, that was no longer possible. 　　But she still had hope in her heart. She took her son’s hand and asked, “Billy, do you still dream of being a fireman when you grow up?” 　　Billy replied, “Yes, I’m always dreaming of that.” 　　Later that day, Mrs. Summon went to the local fire department, where she met Fire Chief Bob Rosen. She told him about her son and asked if he might be able to give him a ride around the block on a fire* engine. 　　The chief said, “We can do better than that. We can make him an honorary fireman for the whole day. And if you give me his size, we can even make him a real fireman’s uniform!” 　　Three days later the chief came to pick up Billy. He dressed Billy in his own little uniform, and escorted* him from the hospital to a hook-and-ladder truck*. 　　Billy sat in the front of the truck and helped steer it back to the fire station. Later, he went out with the crew on three calls. He rode in different fire engines, the ambulance, and even the fire chief’s car. He was also videotaped and appeared on the local news that night. 　　After his dream came true, Billy seemed to get stronger. He lived three months longer than the doctors had predicted. 　　Then one night his vital signs began to drop, and the nurses called Billy’s family to the hospital. One nurse called the fire chief. She asked if a fireman in uniform could come to the hospital to be with Billy. 　　The chief replied, “We can do better than that. We’ll be there in five minutes. But when you hear the sirens screaming and see the lights flashing, please announce that there is no fire. It’s just the fire department coming to see one of its finest members.” 　　About five minutes later, a fire truck arrived at the hospital and extended its ladder up to Billy’s window. Sixteen firefighters climbed into the room, and each gave the boy a hug. Billy looked up at the fire chief and asked, “Chief, am I really a fireman now?” 　　“Billy, you are,” the chief said. 　　With those words, Billy smiled and closed his eyes one last time.

Its 2050.      Its just another morning in 2050. Mario, your buddy bio-bot, comes over to wake you up: Time for school, Elmer. Dont forget to hand in your final report. Remember, its your fifth year in high school. What a nice buddy Mario is! With a word of thanks to Mario, you hurry to the bathroom.        Morning, Elmer, says the wireless magic mirror. You look good as usual. But be careful about your BMI. Youre about to become overweight. A bunch of icons appear on the wall. You press one of them. At once a flash of light flies across to you and your body fat changes into electricity for heating the water. Now, you can enjoy a nice hot shower, quite sure that you have just reduced your BMI. On the other side of the house, the mobile table in the kitchen detects your hunger. It starts the toaster and makes your scrambled eggs the way you like them.          As you finish breakfast, you turn your attention to your heartbeat-powered watch. It reads 7:57 VV only three minutes to your first class! Suddenly, you recall the flying car parked in the garage, a gift to your father from his boss. He wont be driving it today; he walks to the office when it is sunny. The flying car can take off and fly three meters above the road.        Beep, welcome! it says to you as it opens its door. Thanks for riding in me. Where are you heading?        School! you say. Full speed! Quickly, the flying car takes off, and within just thirty seconds youre in school. You get to your classroom right on time.      After school, you fly home again. As Mario passes to you an ice-cold bottle of soda, you notice a text message hovering in the air. Your new order, the wearable computer, has arrived. You can collect it from the store at any time. Thank you. What a nice surprise! You have been expecting one since it was put on the market a week ago. Just as you are wondering how to show off this new gadget to your classmates, another text message flies in and hovers right in front of you, this time for your father:            Mr. Wilson, the vehicle registration card of your flying car will be suspended. You have been accused of speeding.      Air Traffic Police 
The Truth about Fitness Myths     Are you trying to lose some extra pounds so youll look good in your summer clothes? In the summer, many people decide to get fit. But while their motivation is good, their methods sometimes are not.     Over the years, statements like eat less to lose weight have been passed around as good advice. But in fact, such fitness strategies are unhealthyXand even dangerous. Unfortunately, many people want to lose weight so badly that they will believe any adviceXgood or bad.      Here are four of the most often-heard myths about getting fit. 1. If I just eat less, I will lose weight.     Many people only focus on the amount of food they consume each day. They fail to pay attention to what theyre eating. So they may be eating less, but theyre not eating healthily. Be sure to eat a good balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. You need all three food groups to maintain a healthy body. What you eat is important. 2. Running is all the exercise I need to lose weight.      You need aerobic exercise to burn off your extra fat. But that alone doesnt help you get fit. You must also lift weights to build muscle. You need both to get the most effective workout. 3. If I build muscle, I will gain weight.     This statement is actually true. Muscle is more dense than fat, so the same amount weighs more. But muscle also takes up less space. When you replace fat with muscle, you will be thinner and your clothes will feel looser. 4. The miracle14 diets advertised15 on TV will help me lose weight.     Just go channel surfing and you will see ads for the latest diet pill or exercise machine. They promise a miracle solution to your weight problem. But usually, the products dont live up to their promise and can even be dangerous. Dont waste your money on them.    The best advice @  As you can see from the above, not all fitness advice is good advice. Be careful which advice you follow. So, what is the best way to get fit? Eat healthily and maintain a good balance of aerobic and muscle-building exercises. Make your healthy lifestyle last for a lifetime, not just for the summer.

Diving with Courage. @@ @@I like scuba diving. The ideas for my paintings all come from the ocean I dive in. This may sound like an ordinary sentence from an ordinary painter. However, it comes from a man without arms. @@ @@Chen Shih-feng enjoys scuba diving and fishing in the sea. Surprisingly, he moves much better than those who have arms. My first scuba diving teachers refused to go underwater with me, Chen said. One must have an oxygen hose in ones mouth when swimming underwater. Therefore, sign language is the only way to communicate with people in the water. Chen was unlucky because he did not have arms. Finally, he was able to persuade two coaches to go with him. By using my feet and their hands, we are speaking another kind of sign language. @@ @@When Chen was 14, a terrible accident happened to him. Electrical shocks caused him to lose both his arms. Chen, who had a talent for the arts when young, decided to become a painter and hold the brush in his mouth. In the beginning, he faced all sorts of difficulties. He had to pick up a brush with his mouth and paint. I would commonly drip my saliva all over, Chen said. After he finished painting, he would bend under a faucet to wash the brush. Then he would shake his head in order to get the water out of the brush. His face would become totally wet from the water and paint. People often asked him whether he was trying to paint on the canvas or on his own body. @@ @@In 1988, Chen became a member of an international federation of foot and mouth painters. He is good at painting nature scenes and still lifes. Besides, he especially likes to use carp as a subject. He has accomplished what he has today through his hard work and courage. Always show a passion for life and never give up. This is how Chen encourages people in his position to move on. @@ ? by Amanda Sanders 
Do You Believe in Ghosts?      Do you believe in ghosts? When people die, do you think their spirits will go to heaven or hell? It is said that after people die, their spirits often hang around on earth for a while. While they are hanging around with nothing better to do, they may do some evil things. To avoid this kind of trouble, many cultures have special ways of dealing with these lost spirits. @   The midsummer Chinese Ghost Festival was originally a Buddhist holy day. According to an old story, Mulian, a religious Buddhist with special powers, saw his dead mothers spirit suffering in hell. He kept sending his mother food to relieve her pain. However, the food would burn up in the flames before she could eat it. He prayed to Buddha, and he was told  to prepare a feast for all the good spirits still on earth on the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month. In this way, he not only helped the spirits enter paradise, but also released his mother from her pain. Now on July 15, people in Taiwan place food outside and burn paper money for the ghosts. @      Thousands of years ago, people in Ireland believed that on the night of October 31, the souls of those who had recently died would come back. What they wanted to do was take over the bodies of the living. In order to frighten these lonely ghosts away, people dressed up in horrible costumes. They walked noisily around the neighborhood, dancing and shouting at the top of their lungs. Today, October 31 is known as Halloween, and  many kids in the West still dress up as ghosts, mummies, witches, and vampires on that day. They hope that by scaring away the evil spirits, the good spirits may come out on the following day, All Saints Day.      It seems that different cultures have similar ideas about ghosts, and about how to deal with them, but the actual festivals may vary. Just like the living, some ghosts are friendly and some are lonely. Maybe the so-called evil ghosts are just lonely. Why not be nice the next time you meet a lost soul?                                                                                                 ?by Frank Stevenson 
﻿　　Now don’t get me wrong. I am not so dumb1. I get around. I read. I have two older sisters. So, I know what is going on.  　　It was funny how I met him. It was a winter night like any other night. I did not have my chemistry2 homework done. I looked out the window and noticed the moonlight on the twigs1 and the snow blowing in the wind. I just could not stay inside. The skating rink2 is just a five-minute walk from my house if the sidewalks are not slippery3, so I went skating3.  　　I was out of breath4 when I got there. I waited a moment to feel calm5. You know, to start to skate in a crowded6 rink is like jumping onto a moving merry-go-round4. Upon getting into the rink, however, I was fine. At least, I found out exactly7 where the rough8 ice was. It was “round, round, jump the rut5, round, round, jump the rut, round, round─.” 　　And then, there he was! All of a sudden9 his arm was around my waist6 so warm and tight10. And he said, “Mind if I skate with you?” Then he took my other hand. Just like that and we were skating. It was not that I had never skated with a boy before. Don’t be silly. I told you before. I get around. But this was different. He was smooth11! He was a big shot at school and the best dancer in town. This was different.  　　 Then we sat on the big snow bank7 by the rink and just watched. It was cold at first, but pretty soon I got warm all over. He threw12 some snow at me and it fell in a little white shower8 on my hair. And he leaned13 over to brush it off. I held my breath. The night stood still9.  　　Then he sat up straight and said, “We’d better start for home now.” He went to get my shoes. He was still smiling when he came. He took off my skates3 and tied14 the wet skate strings15 in a knot10 and put them over his shoulder. Then he held out his hand and helped me up from the snow bank. 　　It was snowing harder now. Big, quiet flakes11 clung16 to us lovingly12. It was all so lovely that I was sorry I lived only a few blocks away. There was a very short and respectable17 kind of conversation18 and then we were home.  　　The porch19 light was on. We stood there a moment by the front steps20 and the snow turned pinkish13 in the light and a few feathery14 flakes settled21 on my hair. Then he took my skates and put them over my shoulder and stood very very close to my cheek22 and softly23 said, “Good night now. I’ll call you.” 　　 “I’ll call you.” That was what he said, “I’ll call you.” I could not sleep all night. 　　That was last Thursday. Tonight is Tuesday. I cannot think of anything but snowflakes and ice skates and a yellow moon and Thursday night. The telephone is sitting on the corner table─silent24. My heart still prays25 but my mind just laughs. Outside the night is still, so still I think I will go crazy. However, I am not even sad because, all of a sudden, I know. For suddenly9 I know; I know what the stars knew all the time─he will never, never call─never. 
Long ago in Italy3, in the city of Verona4, there lived two noble1 families, the Capulets5 and the Montagues6.

Suddenly his eyes fell upon a girl so beautiful that he almost lost his mind. O, she does teach the lights to burn bright! I never saw true beauty until tonight.  @@Then Romeo watched for an opportunity4 to speak to the girl. As the  next dance ended, he went forward5 and took her by the hand and said, I wish I could have a tender6 kiss!  @@Please give me your hands, not your lips, the girl answered. @@O, dear, let lips do what hands do, said Romeo, and he kissed her gently7. @@Just then a woman told the girl to speak with her  mother. Who is her mother? Romeo asked. @@The lady of the house, said the woman. @@Romeo was shocked8. It seemed that the whole world was falling apart. He, a Montague, had fallen hopelessly9 in love with the daughter of old Capulet! He left the party in confusion10. @@Juliet saw him leaving and sent her servant11 girl to find out his name. When the girl returned12 with the news that he was Romeo, the only son of old Montague, Juliet found it too horrible13 to believe. My only love started from my only hate! she said sadly. @@Romeo walked home past the Capulets orchard7. He stopped and climbed over the orchard wall. Romeo hid in the darkness and looked up at the Capulets house, hoping to see his love. Suddenly he saw her. What light breaks through the window? he said to himself. It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. He watched as Juliet stood at the balcony8, leaning her cheek upon her hand. O, if I were a glove upon the hand, said Romeo, I might touch that cheek!  @@Juliet sighed14 sadly. Romeo, Romeo! Where are you, Romeo? Give up your father, and refuse15 your name; or, if you promise your love, Ill no longer be a Capulet.  Romeo listened as she went on. Its your name that is my enemy16,  O, be some other name! Whats in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.  @@Juliet was surprised to hear Romeos voice answer from the darkness: Call me but love, and Ill have a new name; from now on, I never will be Romeo. Juliet asked how he had made his way into the garden surrounded17 by high stone18 walls. With loves light wings I landed19 on these walls, he said, for stony limits cannot hold love out.  @@That night they exchanged20 vows9 of love and agreed to get married the next day braving21 all hardships22 and great dangers there might be in their future.   
Jenny decided to dump2 Henry, but instead3 of saying I want to break up with you, she said Youre a good guy4.  As Professor5 Brown went into the classroom, he said Its pretty hot here, and two students turned on the air conditioner1. @@You may have found that sometimes our words do not literally2 mean what we want to say in our hearts. But why cant we just say what we mean? Why is so much communication not direct? Why do we have to pick up the actual6 meanings7 of words in the voice and on the face? @@First, it is important to get along and have good relationships8wto make people happy. It is far better to get what we want and to be understood, without saying what we really mean. It makes us feel the fine pleasure of being on the same wavelength9. This is the pleasure of those special conversations when we say just a few wordswor no words at allwand feel understood. It is the communication prize10 and the reason we play the birthday-present and do-you-love-me games. People can protect themselves by using indirectness. @@Second, there is a benefit11 in self-defense12. If what we want or think does not meet with a positive response13, we can take it back, or say that is not what we meant.  @@Through indirectness, we give others an idea of what we have in mind so that we can see what they might think before we give too much awaywa natural way of balancing our needs with the needs of others. It is better to give a hint14 to our listeners about what we want to say. By doing this, we can get a sense of others ideas and how others might react to our ideas. The beauty and dangers of language are two sides of the same coin15: the more indirect1 we are, the more room is left for listeners to interpret16. A word spoken or a small gesture can mean much more than its literal2 sense. But subtle17 signals18 can be missed, and meaning can be taken that was not intended19 and that may or may not be a good thing. @@Our power20 to communicate so much by so few words can inevitably21 cause communication problems. If others respond13 oddly3 to things we say, we may try to state our intentions19 more directly. When we find others indirect, we can ask the speaker to explain22 what he or she means. However, we must realize that some people will feel challenged if their meaning is questioned, and then talk in a way that will make some people uncomfortable4. Therefore, the most important thing is to bear in mind that misunderstandings23 are natural and normal; they are not signs18 that there is something wrong with someone, or with the relationship. 
David Gracer1 eats bugs3. Not any old kind of bug, but insects selected just like any other foodwfor sustenance2 and taste. He eats them cooked in many ways. @@At a time when reality5 television shows make contestants6 eat bugs to shock people, Gracer is one of a small but growing number of people really working to move beyond7 insects bad names. By day, Gracer teaches writing at a community college, but by night, he visits chefs8 to show them that eating insects can be enjoyable and good for the planet9.  @@Of course, humans10 have eaten bugs most of their existence. The Greeks3 and the Romans4 ate them. Many cultures in Asia, Africa, and the Americas5 still raise11 insects for food or collect them in the forest. Gracer hopes that one day the United States6 will join in and have insect farms and begin turning insects into food. After all, if Americans love shrimps7 and lobsters8, why wont they eat their cousins that live on land? @@One of the reasons why Americans are not willing to put insects on the table is because most of them fear insects. Most Americans connect six-legged creatures12 with disease13. For example, mosquitoes9 cause dengue fever10, and cockroaches11 are dirty. However, insects in fact do not normally carry diseases that are terribly bad for people. @@In the kitchen at an ice cream shop, David Gracer pushed a spoon into different insect-and-ice-cream combinations14. He picked up a grasshopper12 covered in burned caramel13 and said, Insects can feed15 the world. @@That sounds interesting. Raising insects is indeed better for the environment than raising cattle16. This is because they need to eat much less and use much less land. Moreover, food made from insects contains17 much more protein18 that the human10 body can actually use than animal protein. Therefore, it is not surprising that the idea of bugs as food is getting serious consideration19 from the Food and Agriculture20 Organization21 of the United Nations (FAO)14. FAO later held a course called Forest Insects as Food: Humans Bite Back in Thailand15. Among22 the questions addressed23 is: Bugs are more nutritious24 than the plants they eat on our farms. So why do we kill them with pesticides16? We should have started eating them long ago. 
@@On January 9, 2003, 159 whales1 were discovered on a beach in New Zealand1. Although about 50 people worked very hard, they managed to help  @@only about 40 whales return to the sea. More than 100 died before they  @@@@could be rescued2. @@@@@@@People have been aware of the problem of beached3 whales  @@@@@for a long time.

Although efforts6 to help beached  @@@@@@whales have increased, they are still usually unsuccessful7. @@@@@@Little is known about the reasons why whales end up on beaches in the first place. However, people have come up with a number of possibilities8. Some think that the whales get lost and swim to shore. Others believe the whales first become sick and then float to shore. Still others think the whales sometimes have problems with their sonar2 navigation9 and therefore cannot see the beach. It has even been suggested that the whales are killing themselves in order to leave more food for members of their family. So which reason is it? Why do whales end up on beaches? @@It seems to be a combination of some of the above reasons. If a whale gets sick (like the whale found on a beach in Spain3 that had swallowed10 over 50 kg11 of plastic bags), it may not be able to swim and may float to shore. But as in the case of the New Zealand whales, how could so many get beached at the same time? The reason is, whales are social animals. If one member of a whale group swims onto a beach, it is possible that others may follow. @@Some people think that noises made by human activities (from ships or submarines12) affect the whales use of sonar. Whales use sound waves to know where they are going and may get confused if there is too much background13 noise in the ocean14. In fact, the U.S. Navy15 admitted that its powerful sonar could be the reason for the beaching3  of whales in the Bahamas4 in  March, 2000. @@People, who try to help beached whales, know that saving beached whales is very difficult. A whale is a huge16 animal whose body cannot support17 its own weight18 out of water. Also, the sun and sand19 can quickly cause a beached whale to get too hot. All agree that the best place for a whale is in the ocean, but sometimes the whale just does not seem to think so. It will take many more years of study before humans can help the whales stay safe in the water. 
Unit 9  A Rabbits Foot and a Piece of Wood. Dear Diary,      I cant believe that Jonathan finally popped the question today! Im engaged! I was so happy that I called Angela and asked her to be one of my bridesmaids. She screamed with me when she heard the news and said yes immediately. And, oh, I MUST lose ten pounds before the wedding! Ive got to look perfect on my wedding.      What this woman wrote in her diary might sound familiar to youXinviting the brides close friends to be her bridesmaids. However, the origin of this custom may not be known by many people. In Roman times, people believed that evil spirits might attend a wedding ceremony and hurt the bride. Therefore, bridesmaids tried to cheat these unwanted visitors by dressing in almost the same way as the bride. This is one superstition. Can you think of any other superstition in everyday activities?      A superstition is a belief that one event can result inXor preventXanother, especially when the two are in no way related. Take a rabbits foot. Rabbits, unlike most other animals, touch the ground with their back feet first when they are running. Many Westerners thus think that this is unusual and regard a rabbits foot as a lucky sign. However, there is no scientific proof of this superstition. Knocking on wood is another similar example. Americans are used to saying knock on wood or actually doing so to prevent something bad from happening when they have just said it wont occur or hasnt occurred. This is because they are afraid that tree spirits would affect their luck. Many people stick to these beliefs because they tend to superstitiously associate one event with another.      In addition to the above superstitions for good luck, some customs that have long been practiced grow out of peoples fears. Most people practice these customs to deal with the unknown. In Taiwan, for instance, the word for the number four sounds like the word for death. Because of this association, the number four has long been viewed as an unlucky number by most Taiwanese people. The reason why people in some Western countries often say Bless you when someone sneezes is also based on superstition. In the past, they used to believe that devils might enter a persons body when that person sneezed.      Nowadays, because of changing ideas, some superstitious customs are practiced in different ways. People are now turning to artificial feet of a rabbit to take the place of real ones, since this will help to stop the unnecessary killing of animals. However, many people still find comfort in following superstition-based customs. Though people are unable to predict the future, they still try their best to find a chance to control it.
