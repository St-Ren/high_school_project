Into Aesop¡¦s World.      A fable is a short story, or folktale, which uses animals as characters and teaches us some kind of ¡§moral¡¨ or moral lesson. Many people are familiar with Aesop¡¦s Fables. The following are two of them. Maybe you can figure out the moral each fable is trying to teach you. The Jay and the Peacock.      A jay that was not satisfied with his appearance walked into a yard where peacocks lived. He found that on the ground were a number of feathers. ¡§They must have fallen from the peacocks when they were changing feathers. I can collect and use them to decorate my body,¡¨ thought the jay. Then he tied the feathers to his tail and strode with pride toward the peacocks. But the peacocks soon discovered the jay¡¦s trick, and they said, ¡§Look! On his tail are the feathers that fell from us! He is a big cheater!¡¨ They then strode up to him, pecked at him, and plucked away his borrowed feathers. The jay had no choice but to go back to the other jays. However, his companions, who had watched his behavior from a distance, were angry at him. They said, ¡§Now you have learned a lesson. It is not only fine feathers that make fine birds.¡¨ The Wolf and the Mastiff. ¡@¡@¡@One night a wolf, who was almost skin and bone, met a fat mastiff. After the wolf said hello to the big dog, he praised its good looks. ¡§If you like,¡¨ answered the mastiff, ¡§you can get as fat and strong as I am.¡¨ ¡§What do I need to do?¡¨ asked the wolf. ¡§Almost nothing,¡¨ answered the mastiff. Then they took a walk together. As they went along, the wolf noticed a spot on the mastiff¡¦s neck. ¡§What¡¦s that mark?¡¨ ¡§Oh, nothing special, just the collar I wear when I am tied up.¡¨ ¡§Tied up!¡¨ cried out the wolf, stopping suddenly. ¡§Do you mean you can¡¦t always run around at will?¡¨ ¡§Well, not always, but does that matter?¡¨ said the mastiff. ¡§It matters a lot to me,¡¨ said the wolf, and he ran once more back into his native forest.  Moral: Better to starve free than to be a fat slave. 
Chien-ming Wang: The Prince of Baseball.    After Chien-ming Wang had pitched for eight innings, Yankees pitching coach Ron Guidry came to talk to him. Wang was told that he had only one more inning to prove his worth. Under great pressure, Wang gave it his best shot on the mound. That night, he tossed a two-hit shutout to beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 6-0. It seems that extra stress always fuels him. In 2006, at the age of twenty-six, he was one of the best young pitchers in Major League Baseball.    Back in 2000, Atlanta offered Wang more money than the Yankees. Instead of signing with Atlanta, however, Wang chose to sign with the Yankees. His reason was simple. He just wanted to be close to his childhood idol, Roger Clemens, a Yankees pitcher. Another episode also reveals Wang¡¦s simple personality. Once John Cox, the scout for the Yankees, paid Wang a visit, and asked what he could do for Wang. To John¡¦s surprise, Wang only asked for a rice cooker.    Wang is a man of few words. Mike Mussina, another superb Yankees pitcher, once said, ¡§I¡¦ve never seen him get excited or upset about anything. But being a pitcher, that¡¦s a good way to be.¡¨ Though he is quiet, he never loses a chance to make people around him laugh. Sometimes he parrots the slang words he has learned from his teammates and uses them on his coaches or friends. Most of the time, he has good  comic timing. His humor therefore has won him many friends on foreign soil.    With more and more calluses on his fingers, he seems to be pitching better and better. Now he is a national hero in Taiwan. Whenever he shows up, fans stop him and ask for an autograph. This big boy from Tainan has finally found his place on the mound.                                                                                                     -by Christy Murphy 
Don¡¦t Be Fooled Again.      There is no easy way of telling when someone is lying, but there are various signs to look for. For example, liars often touch their faces. A liar may stroke his chin or touch his nose. In fact, the fairy tale ¡§Pinocchio¡¨ is closer to reality than one might think. According to the Chicago Smell and Taste Foundation, people¡¦s noses get bigger when they lie because blood goes to the nose. As a result, people often scratch their noses when they are lying. Researchers found this out when they watched a tape of a person talking. When the person was telling the truth, he didn¡¦t touch his nose. When he was lying, he touched it once every four minutes.      You should also watch a person¡¦s eye movements. Most people think that we keep eye contact when we tell the truth and look away when we lie. However, this is not true. Many people look right at you because they want to appear sincere. In fact, there is an unconscious reason why people may not look at you when they are telling the truth. When people have to recall information from memory, their eyes move up. They do this unconsciously again and again.      In addition to body language and eye contact, you can also pay attention to change of voice. A variation in the pitch of a voice or the rate of speech can be a sign of lying. So can lots of ¡§umms¡¨ and ¡§ahhs.¡¨ For instance, if the speaker¡¦s pitch turns high, then it is very possible that the speaker is lying. Complex lies result in a slower speech rate, while simple ones produce the opposite result.      The point here is that no particular behavior means a person is lying. The secret is to watch people closely and follow their mental processes. As you watch their body language, eye movements, and any changes in voice, look for the patterns. The more you practice detecting lies, the better you¡¦ll get at it. 
Communicating with Parents: An Impossible Mission?    Do you find it impossible to communicate with your parents? If so, you¡¦re not alone. Most teenagers say their parents don¡¦t communicate with them but instead just say no to every request. However, the following examples may show you a possible way out. ¡@¡@Jessie: Last summer vacation, Dad didn¡¦t let me get a part-time job. I felt so angry I wanted to walk away, but I didn¡¦t give up because I wanted to learn to be independent through a part-time job. At first, Dad said no. But seeing that I was determined, he changed his mind and said he would help me to find a job. I was delighted when Dad said yes. To repay his agreement, I worked hard all summer as a convenience store clerk and learned a lot. On payday, I took my parents to a nice restaurant. Being patient and understanding helps me bridge the generation gap. ¡@¡@Lisa: Last semester, my mom stopped me from joining the dance club. She thought it would take time away from studying. I lost my temper and yelled at her. I felt bad about my behavior, but I was too embarrassed to apologize. It tortured me for a whole night. The next morning when I saw Mom, I stuttered, ¡§Mom, I¡¦m ¡K sorry. I¡X¡¨ She interrupted, saying, ¡§Never mind, dear.¡¨ The apology comforted her. I promised to study hard to get straight A¡¦s, and she finally allowed me to join the club. From this, I learned that apologizing is the key to opening a closed mind.    Allen: Once I came home late because I was studying in the library and had lost track of time. Mom scolded me as soon as I got home. I felt upset and locked myself in my room, thinking, ¡§I¡¦m old enough. Why not trust me?¡¨ I even thought of leaving home. However, the next morning when I heard Mom making breakfast, I changed my mind and wrote her a letter, explaining why I had come home late and apologizing for the trouble I¡¦d caused. To my surprise, Mom called me and said she was sorry. So, writing a note can be a good way to communicate. ¡@¡@From these students, we learn that a positive attitude¡Xpatience, understanding, and not being afraid to apologize¡Xcan help us communicate with our parents. When they won¡¦t listen, we may even try writing them a letter. So, if we practice these methods, communicating with our parents may be a ¡§mission possible.¡¨                                                         ¡Xby Rebecca Evans 
Earth Ride: Water on Earth. ¡@¡@Welcome to the earth ride! Get ready for a roller-coaster ride around the only planet in the solar system that has life. On earth, every form of life depends on one thing ¡V¡V water.  ¡@¡@Water covers 70 percent of the earth¡¦s surface. But once upon a time, there was none. How did water first appear on earth? To answer this, the earth ride will take us back to a period when the world was very young. Frozen water came to the earth in comets. It¡¦s amazing to realize that every creature on the planet is partly from outer space! Also, some water that was inside the planet became very hot and was pushed to the surface. ¡@¡@After the earth cooled down, water vapor in the atmosphere held the sun¡¦s heat and kept the planet warm. Because of this ¡§greenhouse effect,¡¨ life began. Over time, much of the water rained back down. It created oceans and started the water cycle we have today.  ¡@¡@The water on the planet is used and recycled by all living things. The rain that falls today is the same rain that fell when dinosaurs walked the earth. ¡@¡@On the earth ride we can follow water droplets and enter a tree. Plants are the foundation of the food chain. Without water they can¡¦t grow. It¡¦s just a short ride for a water droplet to travel from a leaf to other forms of life, such as a monkey. Water is also important for animals. A camel can drink 120 liters at one time. Humans should drink at least two liters of water every day. Since it started out as ice from outer space, this water has traveled a long way to get to our bodies! ¡@¡@Today, the water cycle is changing a lot because of humans. Ice is melting at the poles. Deserts are growing larger. Are we using too much of earth¡¦s limited water supply? No one is sure which direction the ride will go next.  ¡@¡@Water remains our most precious resource. We should do what we can to protect the water cycle. Without water, there would be no magical roller-coaster ride of life!                                               --From English 4U, October 2006  
Images of Nature.      Natural scenes often become the themes of poetry. Poets observe nature and present its beauty in their poems. For example, poets may describe natural scenes such as a spring day, a windy day, or a snowy day. Besides, poets often express their feelings about nature by creating vivid images in poems.        An image suggests a mental picture. With an image, poets can describe the details of something vividly. Readers, on the other hand, can relate their own sensory experiences to the images in the poem and thus can share the poets¡¦ ideas. Now let¡¦s read the poem ¡§Who Has Seen the Wind?¡¨  Who Has Seen the Wind? by Christina Georgina Rossetti Who has seen the wind? Neither I nor you: But when the leaves hang trembling The wind is passing thro¡¦. Who has seen the wind? Neither you nor I: But when the trees bow down their heads The wind is passing by.       When we read the lines ¡§when the leaves hang trembling¡¨ and ¡§when the trees bow down their heads,¡¨ they remind us of a windy day. The poet successfully creates an image of the wind by describing details of the scene. These details help readers think of the moment when the wind passes by. We might even bow our own heads, imagining that we are the trees.      The following poem is a stanza from William Blake¡¦s ¡§Night.¡¨ Blake describes many details of a night scene in this poem.  Night by William Blake The sun descending in the west, The evening star does shine; The birds are silent in their nest, And I must seek for mine. The moon, like a flower, In heaven¡¦s high bower, With silent delight Sits and smiles on the night.      People are already very familiar with what they can see at night, like stars or the moon. However, Blake sees more than just the moon itself; he sees the moon as a flower, smiling at us from up in the sky. Thus he is really comparing the moon to both a flower and a smiling person. This unique image makes sense to us, and it somehow feels ¡§right.¡¨      Imagery seems to be an effective way of showing one¡¦s feelings in a poem. We also do the same thing in ordinary conversation, as when we say, ¡§That horse was faster than the wind¡¨ or ¡§She¡¦s the apple of my eye.¡¨ Such images can stir up readers¡¦ (and listeners¡¦) senses. When imagery is combined with rhyme and rhythm, we get poetry.                                                   ----by Allen Collins 
ï»¿We have always found our âsecret2â night-time journeys3 fascinating4. However, do you know that by the time you are sixty you will have slept 175,200 hours, dreamed 87,000 hours and had 197,100 dreams? Probably5 not. Also, many of us probably donât remember what we dreamed during our childhood6 sleeping hours, and donât know what they meant. Some say: Our dreams tell us about our present state7 of consciousness8; this is why we dream.  We dream during the REM1 (rapid eye movement) stage9 of sleep. We have about five periods10 of REM sleep during the night. The first REM cycle11 lasts about ten minutes. As the night goes on, REM cycles get longer. By early morning, REM cycles can last for up to ninety minutes. Usually in this last REM cycle, we remember our dreams. Dreams change as people age. Infants12 dream about half of the time they are asleep13. But, of course, we do not know what they dream about. At age eight or nine, children start to tell their dreams as stories. People aged twenty-one to thirty-four report14 that many of their dreams are about feeling guilty15 for things that they did. Older people usually dream about work or their families. Many dreams show common ideas and concerns. People often dream about falling, flying, or floating16 in the sky. In many dreams, people forget something important, such as going to work on time or putting on clothes. In addition, people miss their bus, plane, or train, or they are late for an appointment17 in their dreams. Furthermore18, most peopleâs dreams have two other people in them. Bad dreams are more common than good ones. When people are in trouble, they often have negative19 dreams. People who had experienced accidents20 when they were young dream about death21 more often than those people who had not. Moreover22, more women than men talk about their dreams.  Do you want to remember your dreams? If you do, you can train yourself to remember your dreams. One way is to tell yourself or record23 your dream when you wake up. Keep a pen and paper or a tape/MP3 recorder2 near your bed to do so. We never stop dreaming. But we cannot really say what dreams mean or how they happen. Dreams are still a mystery.  
¡@¡@I grew up in a little community in the south of Spain. I was 16 when one morning, my father told me I could drive him to a small village1 about 18 miles away, if I would take the car in to be serviced2 at a nearby3 garage4. I was happy to take him because I had just learned to drive and rarely5 had the chance to use the car. I drove Dad to the village and promised to pick him up at 4 p.m. Then I drove to a nearby garage and dropped off the car. I decided to catch a movie or two at a theater near the garage while the car was serviced. However, I became so immersed6 in the films that I lost track of time. When the last movie had finished, I looked down at my watch. It was six o¡¦clock. I was two hours late!  ¡@¡@ I knew Dad would be angry if he found out I had been watching movies. He would never let me drive again. I decided to tell him that the car needed some repairs7 and that they had taken longer than had been expected. I drove up to the place where we had planned to meet and saw Dad waiting patiently around the corner. I apologized8 for being late and told him that I had come as quickly as I could, but the car had needed some major9 repairs. I will never forget the look he gave me. ¡@¡@ ¡§I¡¦m disappointed10 that you feel you have to lie to me, Jason.¡¨ ¡@¡@ ¡§What do you mean? I¡¦m telling the truth11.¡¨  ¡@¡@ Dad looked at me again. ¡§When you didn¡¦t show up, I called the garage to ask if there were any problems, and they told me that you hadn¡¦t yet picked up the car. So, I know there were no problems with the car.¡¨ A feeling12 of guilt ran through me as I confessed13 the real reason for being late. Dad listened sadly.   ¡@¡§I¡¦m angry, not with you but with myself.  You see, I realize that I have failed as a father.  After all these years, you feel that you have to lie to  me. I¡¦m going to walk home now and contemplate14  where I have gone wrong.¡¨  ¡@¡@ ¡§But Dad, it¡¦s 18 miles to home. It¡¦s dark. You cannot walk home.¡¨ ¡@¡@He would not listen. I had let my father down, and I was about to learn one of the most painful15 lessons of my life. Dad began walking along the dusty16 roads. I quickly jumped in the car and followed behind, hoping he would give up. I begged17 all the way, telling him how sorry I was, but he ignored18 me. For 18 miles I drove behind him, averaging19 about five miles per20 hour. ¡@¡@Seeing my father in so much physical21 and emotional22 pain15 was the most distressing23 and difficult experience that I have ever faced. However, it was also the most successful lesson. I have never lied to him ever since. 
Unit 2  In Love with a Cell Phone.      ¡§Sorry for keeping you waiting. I left my cell phone at home, so I went back to get it,¡¨ Adam said as he apologized to Vicky after arriving an hour late for their first date. Vicky tried to be polite, so she forced a smile and replied, ¡§It¡¦s all right. Let¡¦s order something to eat.¡¨ While they were waiting for their food, Vicky discovered that Adam had been checking his cell phone. Just as she got the chance to talk to him, Adam¡¦s cell phone rang and he answered it without delay. He talked continuously and totally ignored his date, who was sitting right next to him. Twenty minutes later, when Adam finally hung up and turned back to Vicky, he saw nothing but a furious face. ¡§Why don¡¦t you date your cell phone?¡¨ said Vicky. Then, she stood up and shouted, ¡§Don¡¦t ever call me again!¡¨      Obviously, Vicky felt insulted and believed that Adam had a greater crush on his cell phone than he had on her. In fact, like Adam, many people who have cell phones in modern society can¡¦t stand to be separated from their cell phones. With their cell phones, they talk to others, listen to music, check e-mail, and download applications as well as photos. Their dependence on this technological device has become so great that the cell phone is now often considered a necessity rather than a luxury. Some cell phone addicts cannot even imagine life without their cell phones. As a result, a psychological term known as ¡§disconnect anxiety¡¨ was born.      According to psychologists, when these addicts are not using their phones, they may start to feel uneasy. Some feel socially isolated when they can¡¦t get access to their cell phone contacts. Others worry about not being able to respond to emergencies promptly. Still others are so psychologically influenced by their cell phones that they often believe their phones have been ringing without their knowledge. Those who suffer from disconnect anxiety frequently check their cell phones for any missed calls or messages. In addition, they like to keep contacting their friends¡Xeven just to kill time. What¡¦s more, if these heavy cell phone users discover that they have forgotten to bring their cell phones along with them, they will insist on returning home to get their ¡§cells.¡¨      It¡¦s nice to have a cell phone, and it makes sense, of course, to enjoy all the advantages this clever product has brought. However, we need to use it wisely. For example, when we are doing something important, we should turn off our cell phones to concentrate on our work. As for Adam, he had better leave his cell phone at home on his next date with Vicky¡Xif he gets another chance to go out with her! ¡XIan Fletcher
