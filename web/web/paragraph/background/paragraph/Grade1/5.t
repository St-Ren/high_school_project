 　　The moment I arrived in Lijiang, a big waterwheel*, the town’s landmark, came into view. It indicated the important role of water in the people’s everyday lives. The water came from melted snow in the nearby mountains and turned into countless* streams that flowed through the town. These streams formed a well-rounded* canal* system that supplied water for the people’s daily needs. 　　On some streets, I found wells with a unique design. The so-called* “three-eyed” well was made up of three linked pools. Each pool was at a different level. In the early morning, I saw a child take drinking water from the first and highest pool. Then his older sister washed food in the second pool. His mother washed clothes in the last and lowest pool. Each pool had a different purpose, and the water was used again and again at different levels. It was not wasted. 　　Another admirable design of water use was their “street cleaning” system. The marketplace was built on a slope. A canal flowed along the west and the higher side of the slope. When a day’s trade was done, the ground of the square was dirty. The people closed a water gate* on the canal to let water flow over the streets. Everyone picked up a brush and took part in the cleaning. The dirty water then flowed into a lower canal, a ditch, on the other side of the square. From there, it was directed out of town to water the nearby farms. 　　I also got a brush and joined this “street washing carnival*.” I saw smiles on the faces of the people. The Lijiang people were happy with the way they lived. They cherished water as a gift from heaven*. They made the best use of this resource so that they could live in harmony with nature.  
﻿ 　　In the traditional story, Santa Claus* had only eight reindeer. They lived with Santa at the North Pole* and pulled Santa’s sleigh every Christmas Eve*. On his sleigh, Santa would deliver Christmas toys to all the good boys and girls who believed in him. 　　Then, in the 1s, an American department store was looking for a way to sell more goods at Christmas time. One of its employees created a character to add to the story. The new character was a reindeer with a bright red nose. He was given the name Rudolph. 　　In the story, Rudolph found himself not fully accepted by the other reindeer. In fact, they looked down on him because of his big red nose. They told jokes about his strange appearance and wouldn’t even let him join in their games. 　　One Christmas Eve at the North Pole, the weather was very dark and stormy. Santa had no one to guide his sleigh on his trip around the world. All at once, Santa thought of Rudolph and his bright, shiny nose, and asked Rudolph to lead the way. Rudolph did a good job and, as a result, Santa was able to deliver his gifts on time. Children woke up on Christmas morning and found their stockings filled with candy and toys. 　　That is the story of Rudolph made up by the department store employee. But Rudolph did not become really well-known until the story was turned into a song, “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.” Today, the song lives on in the hearts of people all around the world. It carries the message of love and tolerance. For many, that is the true meaning of Christmas. And the following are the words of the song: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer Had a very shiny nose. And if you ever saw it You would even say it glows. All of the other reindeer Used to laugh and call him names. They never let poor Rudolph Join in any reindeer games. Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say: “Rudolph with your nose so bright Won’t you guide my sleigh tonight?” Then how the reindeer loved him As they shouted out with glee*: “Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, You’ll go down in history.” 
﻿ 　　“Only let this one teardrop, this Taj Mahal*, glisten* spotlessly* bright on the cheek of time, forever and ever.” This was the way that the Indian poet Tagore* praised India’s famous monument, the Taj Mahal. This was also the poet’s sigh when he thought of Emperor Jahan* and his lasting love for his wife. 　　The moment you enter the Hindu-touch* gateway, a raised marble watercourse* comes into sight. Looking down to the end of it, you see a pure white marble mausoleum*. It stands seventy-six meters high, bathed in milky white sunlight. Its reflection lies glassy in the water. It is so beautiful that you can’t take your eyes off it. The perfectly symmetrical*, Persian*-style garden is divided into sixteen flowerbeds. At the end of the 1-meter watercourse is the main structure, whose Muslim* design and fine decorations are really amazing. Inside the building, the tombs of Emperor Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal* take the tourists back three hundred years to the time of the most touching love story. 　　When Emperor Jahan was only fifteen, he fell in love with Mumtaz at first sight. After that, he loved no lady except her. The two were inseparable companions—Mumtaz traveled everywhere and overcame every difficulty with him. She was such a perfect wife that he named her“Jewel of the Palace.” But sadly, while giving birth to their fourteenth child, she died suddenly at the age of thirty-eight. Legend has it that the emperor cried out in sorrow like a ship tossed by a terrible storm. He hid himself from the public for a year. 　　Returning to public life, Emperor Jahan ordered the construction of the most magnificent monument in memory of his wife. The construction took twenty-two years. It was a labor of love on the part of the grieving husband. The emperor had no concern for anything else. After the completion of the Taj, Jahan fell sick and was faced with an even sadder fate. His son put him under house arrest. He was locked in a room where no one was allowed to visit him. All he could do was cast his eyes on the Taj Mahal, thinking about his late wife. He became weaker with time and died eight years later. 　　To many tourists, the Taj Mahal is simply a world-famous building. It is recognized by UNESCO* as a World Heritage* Site and a“Wonder of the World.” Yet to some, it is a place to silently reflect on a very old, very sad, yet also very beautiful love story. 
Bugs All Around. Good night, sleep tight, Dont let the bugs bite; If they do, dont squall, Take a spoon and eat them all.   @@When someone talks about insects or bugs, most of us express a feeling of disgust. However, this nursery rhyme expresses this feeling in an interesting way. After all, we dont eat things we dislike.  @@Among all insects, mosquitoes are certainly the most irritating ones in our life. We all have had the experience of being disturbed by them and of swatting them at once without thinking. But poets have the ability to change such a disturbing creature into a lively figure. The following poem is a good example: The Mosquitoes Mosquitoes are thin. Mosquitoes are rude. They feast on your skin  For take-out food. Here the poet talks about mosquitoes in a humorous way. Mosquitoes are not just irritating insects, for they become diners who feed on our blood.      Not all insects are as irritating as mosquitoes. Some, like crickets, are liked by most people. Crickets are the theme of the following poem:                              The Crickets You dont need tickets To listen to crickets. They fiddle and sing By rubbing each wing, And never will charge you a fee. Crickets are fiddlers who play free music in this poem. Their sound at night is more pleasant to people than the buzzing noise of mosquitoes. And most of all, crickets dont bite. Perhaps they might even be your favorite insect.     From these poems, we can see that the things around us, even things we hate like insects, may become lovely if we just use our imagination. If we are able to observe things carefully, we can write simple poems about them. Then we will become poets who turn common things into wonders. 
﻿Today, about 4 billion people are using English for their everyday life and work. Of this 4 billion, about 40 % are native English speakers and 60% are non-native speakers. As English becomes an important second language throughout the world, it is changing into a simpler version of itself.  During the last century, American English was getting more popular than the Queen’s English.   Now, the English language is transforming into a new global language. People call it global English or Globish—a tool of communication.  Globish aims to help people from different countries to communicate easily.  As a result, there are a number of things that make Globish different from the "standard" English.  First of all, Globish vocabulary starts with a limited number of English words—just 1,500 easy words.  Also, Globish takes all different English spellings. For example, people can use both theatre and theater.  Most importantly, when people use Globish, clear communication is their biggest concern.  Every speaker should help the listener understand his or her message.  Therefore, a Globish speaker will try to use shorter sentences and keep grammar simple. In addition, Globish speakers may repeat the same sentences twice or add body language to help the listener understand.  They would not use such questions as “You don’t like cats?” in their talk because the listener may not know how to answer the question.  To help the listener understand, Globish speakers will ask “Do you like cats?” with gesture.   Then, the listener will answer the question with a full sentence like “Yes, I like cats.” Or “No, I don’t like cats.” in Globish. A lot of people find Globish easier than the “standard” English. This is true. However, some people think Globish can be too simple and direct.  Speakers may become impolite or even rude when they use too much short and direct language.   For some people, the study of the English language and its culture21 is still useful and can be fun.   Yet, Globish is not an official language but a linguistic8 tool for people to use in this globalized world.   It is one of the modern choices for busy working people around the world. 	
Goal setting has been defined2 as the process3 of deciding the level4  of performance we want to reach5. Most of us have goals in many areas6: academic7, social8, and personal9. Some goals are short-term10, others are medium-term10, and still others are long-term10. For example, a high school freshman11 who is interested in journalism12 might set1 his or her long-term goal on becoming the editor of a college13 newspaper14. For a short-term goal, the student might decide to finish reading five books in a month. A medium-term goal would be to become an editor of  the high school newspaper. By setting shorter-term goals, the student finds  a plan of action to follow to reach his or her long-term goal. Therefore, the  student gains15 a sense of accomplishment while he or she is moving closer to  the long-term goal. This is the reason16 why setting shorter-term goals is the  key to the success in ones life. @@Goal setting is a planning process and an important part of planning our lives. However, although goals help encourage17 our actions, just setting them will not get the whole job done. We still have to work hard to accomplish  them. Setting goals is only the first step in the process of becoming a more successful person. @@Goals help us become aware of our values18 and help us decide what we want to do. Think about your goals. Do your goals motivate you in a positive19 way to be a successful learner20 or do your goals motivate you to just get by, and do as little work as possible? The following is a students reflection21 about his experience with goal setting. A Students Reflection @@In the past, I never really gave much thought to developing personal goals. My dad always told me to set my standards high, and  if I put my mind to something, I could do anything. I never believed this, but I do now. Setting goals is something that I need to do so  that I know where I want to go and how I can get there. I have a  friend who wrote down five goals that he would like to accomplish  this semester22 and put them up on the wall of his room. When I  saw this, I thought to myself: Wow, he knows what he wants  to accomplish. I want to do well in school, but I do not have any specific23 goals! I want to set goals so I have a way of showing myself that I have accomplished something. I feel better about myself when  I accomplish something that I set out to do.  @@After reading his experience with goal setting, are you ready to set your own?  
Unit 5  A Recipe for a Delicious Friendship.      Everyone wants to have friends. But do you know that making friends can be a lot like making soup? That is, to enjoy a close friendship with another person, you have to act like a good chef. First, you need a special recipe to tell you the things that you need. Next, you have to prepare everything properly and then cook it carefully. Friendship Soup Like tomato soup, only Better, more Satisfying, and Good for your soul. All you need is a can of love, Opened with a smile, Poured into a bowl of good environment and similar interests, Mixed with: a Cup of compliments, 3 cups of talking, 5 cups of time togetherX House visits, 2 teaspoons of support, 3 cups of trust, A shoulder to cry on, A basket of hugs, 3 tons of encouragement, And dont forgetXa Bit of nuttiness!      The poem you read on the left page was written by a fourteen-year old student. It is about friendship, and it is called Friendship Soup.      The poem shows that if you want to be someones good friend, you have to make an effort. You cannot just sit back and wait for it to happen. Like a good chef, you have to add some seasoning to make the soup a tasty dish.      The poem also indicates that friendship requires many different ingredients. For instance, trust and similar interests are very important. If you really trust your friends, you can talk to them about any problem that you run into and share your feelings with them. If you and your friends have similar interests, you can spend more time doing things that you are both fond of. In addition to trust and similar interests, friendship needs care as well. You cant leave it alone, just as you cant leave soup on the stove unattended. Friendship, like soup, needs your time and attention, too. Though having a friend keeps you busy, it also makes you happy. A good friend, like a bowl of good soup, can be just what you need when you feel down.      Therefore, when it comes to keeping old friendships and starting new ones, remember that making friends can be a lot like making soupXit may take time and effort, but it is always worth it. XInterpreted and written by Theodore Pigott. The poem is adapted from Friendship Soup.
