 　　Four-year-old Jane Goodall was puzzled by the question of how hens laid eggs. So she set out to find an answer to this mystery. She hid in a henhouse, waiting to see how a hen laid an egg. Finally, four hours later, she had her answer. Excited, she ran off to tell her mother. 　　For Goodall, this event began a lifetime of discovery. 　　Goodall was born in England in 1. She grew up reading Tarzan* books and spent as much time outdoors as she could. When she was nine, she dreamed of going to Africa. She never attended university. Instead, she worked as a waitress for several years, saving money for her trip to Africa. 　　Then at age twenty-three, she finally boarded a ship in England and made her way to Kenya*, where Goodall met the famous anthropologist* Louis Leakey*. She worked as his secretary for a while. Then one day, Leakey told Goodall he wanted to send her to the African rain forest to study chimpanzees. She would have to stay awhile*. He told her that the research project might take as long as ten years. 　　Goodall was excited by the opportunity, but officials worried about her safety in the African rain forest. At that time, chimpanzees were thought to be violent animals. Many people said Goodall wouldn’t last three weeks in the rain forest. They seriously underestimated* her. Goodall’s study of the chimpanzees has lasted for more than forty years.  　　Those forty years have been full of wonderful and surprising discoveries. The more Goodall watched the chimpanzees, the more she noticed how similar they are to humans. Chimpanzees, for example, show affection* in much the same way humans do. They kiss, hug, hold hands, and even tickle one another. Goodall helped us realize that animals can experience emotions. They know both joy and sadness. Amazingly, Goodall discovered that chimpanzees make and use tools. Before this discovery, scientists thought that humans were the only tool makers on earth. Goodall’s discoveries have forced us to look at chimps in a completely new way. We have realized just how much we have in common with other living things.  　　Goodall, who watched hens lay eggs as a little girl, has in fact taught the world another important lesson. She has shown us that a little curiosity and a bold, adventurous spirit can lead to amazing discoveries.

Bob: Is that you, Jimmy Wells? Man: Bless my heart! Its Bob, sure as fate. I was certain Id find you here if you were still alive. Well, well, well! The restaurants gone, or we could have another dinner here. How was the West, old man? Bob: It has given me all I wanted. Youve changed a lot, Jimmy. I never thought you were so tall. Man: Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty. Bob: Are you doing well here in New York, Jimmy? Man: Not bad. I work for the city. Come on, Bob, lets find a place to talk about old times. Narrator: The two men walk up the street, arm in arm. Bob tells his friend all about his career. The other man listens with interest. Soon they pass a brightly-lit store. Under the lights, the two men take a good look at each other. Bob: Hold on! Youre not Jimmy Wells! Twenty years is a long time, but its not long enough to turn a mans eyes from brown to blue! Man: It can be long enough to turn a good man into a bad one. Youve been under arrest for the past ten minutes, Silky Bob. The Chicago police department thought you might come to New York. They have some questions to ask you. Bob (sighs): Ill come quietly. But how did you know where to find me? Man: Heres a note for you. You can read it before I take you to the police station. Its from Patrolman Wells. Narrator: Bob reads the note. Policeman: Dear Bob, I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match to light your cigar, I recognized your face from a wanted poster sent from Chicago. Somehow I couldnt arrest you myself, so I went around and got a  plainclothes detective to do the job. Signed, your friend after twenty years, Jimmy. --from Mystery Plays: 8 Plays for the Classroom Based on Stories by Famous Writers, adapted by Tom Conklin. Copyright ? 1997 by Tom Conklin.

﻿A folktale2 is a story that one generation1 passes down to the next by word of mouth. It is told to amuse, amaze2, or teach the listeners. The story happens in a place and time far distant3 from that of our lives: “Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom4....” Much to one’s enjoyment5, these tales6 feature7 kings and princesses3, giants8 and dragons4, fairies5 and talking animals. The animals in a folktale not only talk but act9 like people. The following is an animal tale from Africa6. 　　Some time ago in the African6 rain forest10, a baby snake set out to play. As he slid away, his mother sang words of caution11:  　　“Watch out, young son, for things with claws7, for things with a beak8, for things with strong jaws12.”  　　“Claws, beak, jaws. Claws, beak, jaws,” Snake Baby replied13.  　　At the same time, a baby frog set out to play. As he hopped away, his mother sang words of caution:  　　“Watch out for the hiss9; watch out for the coil10; watch out for the squeeze14; they will cause15 turmoil11.”  　　“Hiss, coil, squeeze. Hiss, coil, squeeze,” Frog Baby replied.  　　Snake Baby and Frog Baby met in the rain forest and played the day away. What good games they played! First they played Leap16 Frog. Then they played Hide and Hug17. 　　That night Frog Baby told Frog Mama about his fun and the games he played.  　　“No, no, Frog Baby! Hide and Hug is not a game for you. It’s the game of the hiss, coil, and squeeze. Promise18 you’ll never play with him again.”  　　Also that night Snake Baby told Snake Mama about his fun and the games he played.  　　“No, no, Snake Baby! Hide and Hug is not a game for you. Hide and Hug is what you must do. This is the way you get your meals! Promise me you’ll hiss, coil, and squeeze. It’ll feel so good and then your belly19 will become full”  　　The next day as Frog Baby set out, he fearfully repeated his words of caution, “Hiss, coil, and squeeze.” But as Snake Baby set out, he happily sang, “Hiss, coil, and squeeze. Make a meal for me.”  　　Now we know why we never see frogs and snakes playing games together; it is against20 their natures21. 
﻿Colleen Keefe1 and Shauna Dickey2 wrote the following letter in memory1 of their friend, Meghan3. Sadly, Meghan had died in a car crash2 at the age of sixteen. Dear Meghan, Shauna and I had a chance to say goodbye to you last week. But we still have a long way to go together.  When I heard the news of your leaving us so soon, all I could do was hug my blanket and close my eyes. I hoped that when I opened them, the nightmare3 would be gone. On my way to comfort4 your mom and dad, I realized5 I needed to give you a part of me. It symbolizes6 our friendship7. So when you are walking around the clouds above, everyone would ask what it means. So I give to you a piece of my blanket in the shape of a heart. There is also a picture of the three of us—you, Shauna, and me. We three enjoyed taking photos8, and this one is our favorite.  　This blanket was given to me by my grandfather. He is in heaven9 with you. He will recognize10 the blanket. He might not recognize my picture because he has been gone for over fourteen years. He gave this to me to keep me warm, and now I give it to you to keep you warm. And don’t be afraid when he stops you and talks in that big deep11 voice. Give him a big hug and a kiss for me, and tell him I said to take care of you.  Now that we know you are taken care of, we can move on with our lives. We will always remember you, and as Shauna and I know you are looking down on us, we are sure we will make you laugh in our usual silly12, clumsy13 way. So keep smiling, for that is how we remember you.  We found out that one of the recipients of your organ15 donation16 is doing well. Even in your death, you have helped others.  Goodbye, my friend, we miss you already. Give us a nudge4 when we are heading in the wrong direction17 and, of course, keep “dancing.” Shauna wants you to say hi to Elvis5 for her. He’s probably in the food court18.  Every time I wrap19 my blanket around me, I will feel your presence20. Stay warm.  Love, Colleen Keefe and Shauna Dickey

Unit 12  Working for Nothing Pays Off.      Volunteers have long played an important role in our lives. They are enthusiastic people who simply like to help others and never ask for payment. The concept of volunteering began centuries ago. In the early American colonies, people were expected to spend their spare time helping out in their communities. Benjamin Franklin, one of the most influential politicians in American history, put this idea into practice by setting up a volunteer fire department in Philadelphia. Today, most rural communities and many small towns in the U.S.A. still depend on volunteers to fight fires.      In modern society, volunteer work remains as important as it has ever been. In fact, more and more people are taking part in volunteer work. For example, they take scout groups on camping trips, clean up town parks, and pick up litter along hiking trails. Whats more, they also visit the sick and the elderly to provide them with care and help.      It is obvious that volunteer work helps society. However, does it also help the volunteers? Do volunteers get anything out of their work, besides the sense of achievement? Sure they do. Through volunteer work, most people can get valuable experience and knowledge. Many volunteers can also learn new skills which prepare them for full-time jobs. Moreover, it might surprise you that such experience is sometimes as helpful as a degree when it comes to landing a job. Let us say you sort mail in the office of a hospital on weekdays. When the weekend comes, it is time for you, the volunteer, to go out and raise funds on the busy city streets or in front of shopping centers. Now, it may seem worthless to do all of this unpaid work. But when you are looking for a paid job, the experience youve gained as a volunteer may give you an advantage over other job seekers. That is, job seekers with volunteer experience are more likely to be hired than those people who have never volunteered. The reason is that they have had more chances to learn how to handle difficulties.      Of course, volunteer work may have nothing to do with the career you want to pursue. Does that mean theres no benefit in it? Absolutely not! Volunteer work can teach you a lot about yourselfXand this is probably the greatest benefit of all. Volunteer work can also help you explore what you are able to do best. In addition, it can help you learn about certain kinds of work and the way to deal with other people as well.      Your future is important, and your service to society is important, too. Have you ever volunteered? If you havent, its time for you to get involved in such unpaid work!

Unit 4  A Colorful Life.      As usual, Amber woke up late again and had to run fast enough to catch the yellow school bus. Luckily, the traffic lights turned green just as she was about to cross the road, so she made it to the bus. When the bus passed the golden arches of McDonalds, she felt a sudden desire to have a hamburger. She hadnt had breakfast that morning because the fruit salad on the blue dish which her mother had prepared for her looked far from delicious. It also occurred to Amber that she should stay on her diet. Thus, she was in a really black mood.      Perhaps you have noticed that several colors are used in the above story. In fact, colors play a more influential role in our life than we can ever imagine. Take the English language, for example. We may describe a sick person as being a bit green. Sometimes, we may also use symbolic meanings of colors to talk about things. For example, to describe a boring show, we can say that this show is a bit gray. As we can see, colors do spice up ordinary conversations.      Besides, effects of colors can be applied to many parts of our daily life. Have you ever thought about why school buses and taxis are painted yellow, and stop signs red? It is because yellow is bright enough to attract peoples attention, even in heavy traffic. As for red, it is usually used to indicate warning; as a result, most traffic signs use this color.      How colors affect appetite is another thing that most people probably do not notice. According to studies, the colors of a dining environment can influence how much we eat. Most fast-food restaurants are decorated in bright colors to increase peoples appetites. This is because bright colors are the natural colors of many foods and are able to raise peoples spirits. Blue, in comparison with bright colors, may spoil a persons appetite because very few foods are blue in nature. For people who are on a diet, blue dishes and bowls might help. Believe it or not, though we may not be aware of them, colors are everywhere both in our daily routine and in everyday conversations!      When Amber got to her classroom, her best friend, Violet, walked over to greet her. Morning, Amber! What happened? You look a bit green, said Violet.      Nothing . . . just feeling . . . blue, replied Amber.      Hey! Why not come to my place tonight? said Violet. Guess what I just bought! A new video game! Its red-hot.      Amber was tickled pink to have the chance to play the video game and said, Sounds great! XBarbara Cromarty 
Unit 7  The Power of the Press.      Freedom of the press is rightly protected in most democratic societies, yet it is just this protection that sometimes allows this freedom to be made bad use of. The press has a strong influence which can bring about significant changes to the lives of ordinary people, and sometimes even bring down a government.      Stories about individual people tend to attract far more public attention than political events do. To increase the sales of their newspaper or magazine, journalists may try every means to explore these stories. Thus, they can easily cause individuals great inconvenience by visiting them frequently and publishing details of their private lives. The story of the first quintuplets in America clearly illustrated the power of the press.      There was a poor family living in Aberdeen, a small town in the U.S.A. Raising five children in conditions of poverty was already a struggle for the parents of this family. When the pregnant mother learned that it was another four girls and one more boy that were on the way, she and her husband were shocked beyond belief. Without a doubt, they were going to face even more urgent economic problems.      Nonetheless, this event changed their lives in ways they had never expected. The day after the birth of the five babies, there were sixty reporters and photographers waiting outside their door. The couple soon made national headlines, for they had become the parents of the first quintuplets in America.      The family gained fame and fortune overnight. Newspapers and magazines offered them huge sums of money for exclusive rights to publish their stories as well as their photos. Gifts poured in not only from unknown people, but also from baby food and soap manufacturers who wanted to advertise their products. Though their lives were indeed improved, reporters kept pressing for interviews, which forced the family to hire lawyers to act as spokespeople for them at news conferences.      Moreover, the birth also brought great changes to Aberdeen. Plans for a new highway were developed, since this town was likely to attract thousands of visitors. Even the name of the town on the road signs was changed to Quint-City, U.S.A. Locals also discussed the possibility of setting up a quint museum to satisfy the curiosity of the public and to protect the family from gossipy visitors at the same time.      While the babies were still quietly sleeping in the hospital, their parents began paying the price for fame. It would never again be possible for them to lead normal lives. The town itself received so much attention that almost each of the residents there was affected to a certain extent. This was the power of the press, but such power could easily be misapplied.

	She had no job. She was a single mother, living in a small apartment with her baby daughter. Life was hard. Now, she is a great success. Children and adults buy her books all over the world- in thirty languages. It seems her books win awards and break records almost every day. Who is she? J. K. Rowling-the woman who wrote the Harry Potter Stories. What is the secret6 of her success? STEP 1 : Do something that you enjoy.     Rowling says she wrote Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone- the first book in the series- because she wanted a challenge. She wanted to achieve something special. She likes writing. In fact, she wrote her first book (called Rabbit) when she was six years old. Perhaps this is the first reason for her success- she chose to do something that she enjoyed. 	    But how did she become such a great success? Well, in 1992, Rowling left her job in England and went to Portugal. She moved to Portugal to have more time to do what she loved most- write. She worked as an English teacher. She used her free time in the mornings to write Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone.  STEP 2 : Follow your dream.     She got married, but later divorced. She returned home to the U.K. with her baby daughter Jessica. She lived in Edinburgh in Scotland. She lived in a very small, cold apartment. Life as a single mother was hard, but she was determined to finish writing Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone. She wrote mostly in cafes and while her daughter was asleep. She had no money for a computer or typewriter-she used a pen and paper. When things became difficult, she didnt forget her goal, and she didnt stop working. STEP 3 : Never give up.     The road to success was hard for Rowling, but eventually she succeeded. Her advice to people who want success is simple: Try your best. If you really want to succeed, then you will. Be prepared to make mistakes- learn from them. You have to be strong, and never give up. Sounds simple, doesnt it? 
	In the mid-1990s, two language researchers did an interesting experiment with a group of English-language students in Japan. These students were retaking the English courses they had previously failed. On language tests, these students were far behind the regular university students. Since most of these students disliked studying English, few expected much improvement. 	The researchers put these students in a special class for the second semester of the English course. The class met for the same amount of time as the regular English courses, but the way the class was taught was very different. At the end of the semester, the students took another language test and the results were surprising. In just one semester, the students in the special class had improved so much that their scores on the new test were almost as high as those of the regular English students. In addition, these students, who had been afraid of English, started to enjoy the class.  	What was this secret method that produced such surprising results with these previously reluctant learners? The class was an extensive reading course. Extensive reading is simply reading a lot of English at a fairly easy level. The students in the course spent almost all of their class time simply reading enjoyable books.  	In study after study, researchers are finding that extensive reading can play a big role in language learning success. In fact, one study found that reading for pleasure and seeking opportunities to read in English are the two factors most strongly related to successful language learning. 	Extensive reading allows students to see the language in context over and over again, giving them the exposure they need to understand, organize, remember, and use it. It builds vocabulary and grammar knowledge. In short, extensive reading provides a very strong foundation for all language skill.
