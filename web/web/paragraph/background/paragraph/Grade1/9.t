 　　Do you like poems? Have you ever read a poem in English? Try this one. Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are. Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are. 　　Isn’t this a song? Yes, but it is also a poem. We can also call it a nursery rhyme*, a kind of short poem or song that is written for children. Nursery rhymes are easily remembered, even by young children. This is not only because they are short but also because they rhyme. Rhyming is the magic that makes poems and songs so pleasant to the ear. And because we enjoy their sounds, we learn to read them easily. 　　Writing rhymes is a kind of wordplay*. It is not only a job for poets; in fact, it is a game for everyone. And if you want to try it by yourself, you are encouraged to read more poems first. When you read them, remember to pay special attention to the rhyming words. Here is another one for you to enjoy. I Heard a Bird Sing I heard a bird sing In the dark of December A magical thing And sweet to remember. “We are nearer to Spring Than we were in September,” I heard a bird sing In the dark of December. 　　Did you enjoy listening for the rhyming words? And did you notice their pattern? Unlike “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,” this poem rhymes in every other line. 　　However, don’t forget to read the poem as a whole in order to appreciate its beauty. With a few simple words, the poet creates a beautiful picture. Just imagine this: on a cold winter night, a bird is singing a sweet melody to tell everyone that spring is coming. And this good news is just like magic. It not only brightens up the world but also warms people’s hearts on such a dark and chilly night. 　　Poetry is beautiful. With rhymes, it is more fun. Would you like to read more poems or even create poems of your own? 
﻿ 　　ORBIS* is an international organization devoted to preventing and curing blindness worldwide. The word “orbis” means “eye” in Latin*. The organization has a very unusual airplane—the “Flying Eye Hospital.” The plane’s mission is to help blind people see again. 　　The loss of sight is a tragic blow to an individual and has a great impact on his or her family. People often feel hopeless when they become blind. The good news is that 7 percent of all blindness can be cured. The problem is that there are not enough well-trained* doctors in many remote areas. 　　ORBIS tries to solve this problem by reaching out to those places and providing training for the doctors there. The Flying Eye Hospital has the most advanced equipment and operating rooms. When it stops at a place, the doctors on board give operations to some patients. A video camera* sends clear pictures of the operation to the ground. The local doctors can watch and learn advanced operating skills. In places where the aircraft cannot land, ORBIS also has training programs in local hospitals. To date, more than twenty million blind people have benefited from ORBIS, and the number is still growing.  　　ORBIS has permanent programs in several countries. ORBIS Taiwan is one of the sixteen ORBIS International offices. A number of volunteer eye doctors from Taiwan have been working on board the Flying Eye Hospital. They join doctors from around the world to help the blind, giving them the chance to see the blue sky, the green grass, the red flowers, and the smiling faces of their relatives. 
﻿ 　　Every culture associates certain meanings with colors. For example, in English-speaking societies, the color blue is linked to sorrow, green is considered envy, and yellow is connected with cowardice*. However, in some cases, the same color has obviously different meanings in different cultures. Some interesting examples include red, black and white, which are seen differently by western and Chinese societies in terms of their meanings. 　　In Chinese culture, the color red is thought to stand for good fortune and happiness. Therefore, this color is often seen in weddings, New Year’s celebrations, and festivities* surrounding the birth of a new baby. While red is generally given a positive meaning in Chinese culture, in western culture it typically has negative meanings. This color is closely linked to anger (as in the expression“seeing red”) and embarrassment (as in the idiom“red in the face”). In soccer, a player who breaks a major rule is given a“red card”and taken out of the game. 　　Another interesting example of how red is given a more positive meaning in Chinese than in western culture can be observed in the way the color is used in business. In Chinese stock* markets, increases in share values are marked in red, while losses are indicated in green. The opposite is true in western stock markets, where dropping stock prices are marked in red. In fact, the English expression“in the red”means that a company is losing money, while being“in the black”means that profits are being made. 　　There are also major differences between the two cultures in the way they see black and white. In the western world, black is the color of mourning* and is worn at funerals by both men and women. In Chinese culture, on the other hand, it is the color white that traditionally has this role, although black is sometimes worn on such occasions nowadays as well. At a traditional funeral, mourners are usually dressed in white and give white envelopes with money inside to the dead person’s family. In most western cultures, on the other hand, white is associated with purity. That’s why new brides wear this color on their wedding day nowadays, though the brides in the past used to wear green, which stood for fertility*, or other colors. 　　There is more to color than meets the eye. The next time you are at some kind of ceremony or other special events, look at the colors all around you and think about the special meanings some of them may have. 
Country Music.      Country music is very old. It came from the United States, Canada, Ireland, and Great Britain. Country music is a mixture1 of music from all of these places.      In the American West, cowboys had to take care of the cattle. They had to watch them all day and all night because the cattle were nervous and sometimes ran away. A cowboys life was lonely and dangerous. When he was alone in the desert with the cattle, he drank strong coffee with lots of caffeine to stay awake at night. He also sang to the cattle to calm them. He sang about the stars and the moon, about his family and his friends. The cattle listened to the cowboy and went to sleep. They did not run away if he sang beautiful, peaceful music.      The cowboys played music either on guitars or on harmonicas. Later, they used violins and other instruments. In the American South, many people came from Ireland, Scotland, and England. Other people came from French Canada. They enjoyed their own kind of music. They used guitars, violins, and harmonicas, too. However, they also added instruments from their homes, like bottles, cans, and spoons.      Country music describes life. It talks about love, jobs, home, and money. It also talks about friends and enemies, trucks and highways, farms and crops. People in many parts of the world like country music because everyone knows something about these things.      When it comes to songs, it would be difficult to really understand or even enjoy them without listening to both the words and the music. The following is a classic country song. Why not put on some cowboy clothes like many country music fans do and sing it? You will certainly have a better understanding of the music. Who knows? You may even fall in love with it.

A Prescription for Mozart.      Imagine going to your doctor with a headache. Your doctor gives you a prescription. It is not for aspirin, but for Mozart. @@Many kinds of music can produce strong feelings. For some people, romantic music brings feelings of love. Spiritual music can help some people feel peace. But one musician in particular seems to have an ability to heal the human body: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Scientists have found Mozarts music to be able to calm its listeners. It can also help them express themselves clearly. @@Many cases in which Mozart is used as a healing aid have been reported. For example, a premature baby named Krissy, who weighed just one and a half pounds, was on total life support. Doctors thought she had little chance to live. But her mother kept playing Mozart for Krissy and thought it might save her daughters life. To their surprise, Krissy lived, and at the age of four she showed an interest in music. Krissy was able to play musical pieces from memory that were far beyond the ability of an average four-year-old.    @@Other stories also show the effect of Mozarts music. Officials in Washington State report that newcomers from Asia learn English more quickly when they listen to Mozart. In Canada, it seems that Mozart string quartets performing in city squares can calm pedestrian traffic. Even animals respond to Mozart. In France, cows give more milk when they listen to Mozart.    @@Why Mozart, not Bach or the Beatles? Any kind of music can have an effect on some people. But Mozart has more balance than most. It is not too fast or too slow; it is just right. Don Campbell, writer of The Mozart Effect, says, Its like food. A hot spicy meal will affect you differently than a sweet dessert. While you might love these foods, they arent good for you to eat every day. You need simple, nutritious food on a steady basis. Thats the way Mozart is. Its like a well-balanced meal that brings order and harmony to your body.  Vby Berish, Linda and Sandra Thibaudeau, from Amazing Stories to Tell and Retell, Level 3.

Bird-Watching in Taiwan.      It is a cloudy day in October. Over the Tseng-wen estuary in Taiwan, a group of large white birds with black faces appears. These beautiful black-faced spoonbills are some of the worlds rarest birds. There are only about six hundred of them in the world. The birds have flown all the way from their summer home in Korea. Now, they circle and land. Almost immediately, a crowd of people begin to shoot them.      Is this the end for the spoonbills? No, the people who have been waiting are happy to see the spoonbills. They are only shooting photographs. These people are some of Taiwans enthusiastic bird-watchers, or, as they are usually called, birders.      Birders look at birds from a distance, usually through binoculars. This hobby began in Europe in the 1800s and spread around the world. Although it did not come to Taiwan until the 1960s, it has become very popular here, especially among young people. Groups of young birders compete to spot the most species. Why do so many people enjoy birding? It gets them out of the cities and into nature, they explain. I never knew how beautiful Taiwan was until I started birding, says one young bird-watcher. In addition to local birders, there are also many bird-watching tourists from North America, Europe, and Japan.      Taiwan is a paradise for birders. This small island has many different climate zones, from tropical on the coast to cold in the mountains. Each of these areas attracts different speciesXabout 440 species altogether. For comparison, in the United States, which is over 250 times larger than Taiwan, there are only 800 bird species. In fact, Taiwan has more bird species per square kilometer than almost any other place in the world. Only Madagascar has a greater number of species per square kilometer than Taiwan.      The Wild Bird Society of Taiwan says that 40 percent of Taiwans birds are residents. Resident birds live in Taiwan all the time. Most of them live in the mountains in the middle of the island. Of these, 15 species are found in no other country but Taiwan. Another 40 percent are migrants. In other words, they dont live in Taiwan all the time. Many birds fly south from Siberia, Korea, and Japan in the fall. Some continue south to Indonesia, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand. Others stay in Taiwan for the winter. In the spring, Taiwan is visited by birds from the south. The remaining 20 percent of Taiwans birds are, well, lost. They usually stop on the island because of bad weather. These birds are called vagrants.      Taiwans birders love to watch birds, but they also try to protect them. They have had some success. In 1981, the Taiwanese government created special areas for birds. Birders also try to stop industrial development in places where rare birds live. They are fighting against a plan to build an oil refinery and steel mill near the spoonbills nesting ground. The plan has been delayed for now, and the population of spoonbills has almost doubled.      Today the birds, tomorrow the humans, birders often say. In other words, the same ecological problems that kill birds now may someday endanger the health of people. In Taiwan, birders are working to save birds for future generations to enjoy. And thanks to the birders, the black-faced spoonbills still have a home to come to from their long trip across the sea. 
The Bermuda Triangle---A Modern Mystery. 	The Bermuda Triangle---sometimes called the Devils Triangle---is an area between Bermuda, Florida, and Puerto Rico. It is well-known for the unexplained disappearance in the area of several hundred ships, aircraft, and people. In most cases, the victims have vanished without warning in seconds, and often in good weather. Wreckage and bodies are almost never recovered. 	Strange events in the area go as far back as Christopher Columbus, who in 1492 saw strange lights in the sky there. The name Bermuda Triangle, however, was not used until 1964 when it appeared in an article by Vincent H. Gaddis in the magazine Argosy. 	In 1918, the U.S. Navy ship Cyclops, and all three hundred people on board, disappeared completely. In 1941, two more U.S. ships, the Proteus and the Nereus, both vanished traveling from the Virgin Islands to the U.S.A. Many other vessels have been lost, including the nuclear-powered submarine Scorpion, with a crew of ninety-nine, which disappeared in 1968. 	But perhaps the most famous of all disappearances has been Flight 19. In 1945, five U.S. Navy planes and their fourteen crewmen vanished. A rescue plane sent to find them vanished, too. Much larger aircraft also have disappeared, including a Super Constellation in 1954 with forty-two passengers aboard. An Air Force KB-50 tanker with eight crew members vanished in 1962. 	There are many theories about why so many planes and ships have been lost in this area. It is known that compasses in this region often give false readings because of natural changes in the earths magnetic field. This can lead to human error. This also happens in an area named the Devils Sea off the east coast of Japan. This area also is famous for disappearances of ships and planes. In addition, the weather in the Bermuda Triangle can be very unpredictable, and thunderstorms are a hazard.  	However, many of the disappearances have happened very suddenly. Some people suggest strange forces such as alien abductions and time warps in the skies, and others say the lost city of Atlantis is in the region and that this has a mysterious power that causes the disasters. Whatever the cause, one thing is certain: the Bermuda Triangle remains a great modern mystery. 	 
﻿The Earth is getting warmer because people are adding gases to the  environment3 that trap4 heat. Many scientists5 regard6 burning too much fossil1  fuel2 as one of the main7 causes of global warming8. As global temperatures9 rise10, our climate and our environment change greatly. People, animals, and our living environment are experiencing the consequences11 of these changes  in many ways. The extreme12 weather may be the most serious result of climate change. Snowstorms3 and heatwaves4 are examples. In recent13 years, thousands of people in Europe5 and North America were hurt, made ill, and even killed because of the extremely12 high or low temperatures. An increase14 of droughts6 and floods15 also damages16 food production17 and causes serious illness in Asia7 and Africa. “Can we do something to lessen18 the impact of climate change?” Many people ask this question. In Taiwan, people have taken action. For example, there are new laws to push for developing19 green and clean energy20 such as wind and solar8 power. The new policies21 aim to reduce22 the use of fossil fuels and carbon9 emissions10. Electric23 scooters and bikes are also more and more popular. People hope to slow down the climate change by releasing less carbon and heat into the air. When people view the climate change as a serious thing, they understand that dealing with climate change is not an easy job. Everyone has to work together for the living environment. Adopting24 new lifestyles with less carbon emissions can be a very good start. We believe that everyone’s goodwill11 for the Earth will bring us a better world. 
﻿ 　　Lunar New Year is the most spectacular1 festival for Chinese communities2 around the world. It is an occasion3 for people to be away from work and get together with family and friends. Lunar New Year is celebrated in several countries in Asia such as Tibet2, Mongolia3, Korea4, China, Vietnam5, and of course Taiwan. Owing to their historical4 connection5 to China, no matter which calendar6 is followed, these countries celebrate the arrival7 of spring with shared traditions8 and special events9. The holiday lasts10 for a few  days, as in Korea and Taiwan, and up to two or more weeks, as in Tibet and Vietnam. The origin11 of the Lunar New Year  Festival can be traced back to thousands  of years ago. One of the most famous  traditions is about Nian6. Nian is believed to be  a terrible beast7 that came out to eat people on  New Year’s Eve. To frighten12 Nian away, red-paper  couplets8 are put on doors, lanterns are lit, and firecrackers9 are set off all night. Early the next morning and throughout the festival, people say gong xi or “congratulations13” to each other for getting through the night safely. Another important tradition takes place on Lunar New Year’s Eve when families get together for a big dinner. Hong bao10 is given out and everyone tries to stay up all night to welcome the New Year. Some families perform14 traditional8 religious15 rites16 after midnight17 to welcome the God of the New Year. The rites are then followed by a storm18 of firecrackers. Some say that the Lunar New Year’s magic has worn off in Taiwan because of the island’s modernization11, but the festival is still the most important one of the year. Therefore, even though the official holiday lasts just a few days and many people spend much time in traffic jams19, at busy airports, and on full trains and buses, they are still excited to get home in time for the most important family dinner of the year. Indeed20, no matter  what changes may occur21 in the future, the connection to family will always lie at the heart of Lunar New Year celebrations.
@@The Daffodils1 is one of the best-known poems of the English language. It was written by William Wordsworth2 in 1804. Wordsworth was inspired by a long belt3 of daffodils that he and his sister, Dorothy3, found during a walk on April 15, 1802. @@However, the beauty of the daffodils did not strike4 him until much later. It was on a day when he was feeling sad and lonely that he remembered the daffodils, and that cheered him up considerably. @@Dorothy later wrote to her brother about this walk: I have never seen such beautiful daffodils. Some rested their heads upon mossy4 stones as if they were pillows5, and others tossed6 and danced and seemed to be laughing with the wind that blew upon them over the lake. They looked so gay7, dancing and changing all the time. William Wordsworth was inspired by what his sister wrote and composed8 this famous poem shortly after that, as shown in the following. I WANDERED LONELY AS A CLOUD I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high oer vales5 and hills, When all at once I saw a crowd, A host9, of golden daffodils, Beside the lake, beneath10 the trees, Fluttering6 and dancing in the breeze11. Continuous as the stars that shine12 And twinkle13 on the milky way7, They stretched14 in never-ending line Along the margin15 of a bay16: Ten thousand saw I at a glance17, Tossing their heads in sprightly8 dance. The waves beside them danced; but they Out-did the sparkling18 waves in glee9; A poet could not but be gay, In such a jocund10 company; I gazed19 V and gazed V but little thought What wealth the show to me had brought: For oft11, when on my couch I lie In vacant20 or in pensive12 mood21, They flash22 upon that inward13 eye Which is the bliss14 of solitude23; And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils. 
Unit 11  The Best Medicine.      The human body has an amazing ability to heal itself. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the human body can naturally fight off 85 percent of all illnesses. Many doctors would add that a persons emotions and mental attitude may either support or weaken the bodys healing ability.      Studies focusing on the link between emotions and the bodys immune system indicate that negative attitudes, thoughts, and emotions may lower the bodys immune responses. On the other hand, positive ones like love, joy, and laughter can support the bodys immune responses. Doctors have found clear proof to back up the claim that in many ways laughter is the best medicine.      First of all, laughing relaxes muscles. As one study showed, people were able to relax their muscles more quickly after they had watched funny cartoons than after they had looked at beautiful pictures of nature. And you dont need complicated equipment to test this effect. Next time your friends laugh, ask them how they feel afterward. Generally, people will respond that they feel more relaxed than they usually do. Laughter also provides excellent exercise for your heart. After a good laugh, a persons heart rate is well above normal, and this may last for up to five minutes. Thus, some doctors refer to laughter as internal jogging.      In addition, laughter can stimulate the bodys production of immunoglobulin A (IgA). IgA is what the body uses to fight colds and the flu. Several studies have found that after people watch 30 minutes of comedies, the level of IgA in their blood has increased. What is more, these studies included both adults and children.      Although no studies have been able to show a clear link between laughter and pain reduction, many patients have reported a decrease in pain after a good laugh. This reduction in pain may result from chemicals produced in the blood. Also, patients might feel less pain because their muscles are more relaxed, or because they are simply distracted from thinking about their pain. It doesnt matter what the truth may be, since there are plenty of people who would agree with the comedian Groucho Marx, who once said, A clown is like aspirin, only he works twice as fast.

Unit 3  The Wonderful World of Hayao Miyazaki.      Many people may have either heard of Hayao Miyazaki, a well-known Japanese animator, or seen his internationally praised films. His films, such as My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, and Howls Moving Castle, have attracted the interest of people of all ages around the world. When moviegoers steep themselves in Miyazakis films, they easily note three marked characteristics.      First, the main characters are often tough females who always face difficulties bravely and try to overcome them. Take Satsuki, the twelve-year-old main character in My Neighbor Totoro, for example. She has to take care of her younger sister and do piles of housework because their father is busy working while their mother is being treated in a hospital. Actually, Satsukis childhood is similar to Miyazakis. When Miyazaki was about six, his mother was treated for a lung infection, and this continued until his teenage years. Consequently, Miyazaki had to care for his two younger brothers, just as Satsuki does in the film.      Second, flying is a major theme in many of Miyazakis works. Miyazakis father worked in aviation, and this led to Miyazakis interest in flying. When Miyazaki was a child, he would spend hours drawing planes. After he started to create his own works, flying naturally became a repeated theme in his animated films. Various flying vehicles, such as a witchs broom and military vessels, have appeared in his films.      Third, Miyazakis films consist of characters that are very different from the characters in typical Hollywood animations. The characters he created reflect reality. They are neither totally good nor absolutely wicked, which is true to life. As the stories in his films progress, villains reveal certain positive sides, as well as violence, evil, and hate. Good is mixed with bad, and the tension between the two gives richness and complexity to Miyazakis stories. If his characters were similar to the characters in Hollywood animations, his works might not be so unique.      With these special characteristics, Miyazakis films have not only hit it big in Japan, but also impressed audiences and critics alike from the four corners of the earth. In 2002, the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature went to Spirited Away, the first Japanese animated film that won an Oscar. In spite of those achievements, Miyazaki has remained true to his own ideals and beliefs, which are expressed in each of his productions. Without a doubt, with the wonderful worlds he creates in his movies, this imaginative animator as well as his brilliant films will always fill people with awe. XBarbara Cromarty
