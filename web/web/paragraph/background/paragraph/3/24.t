The Tomato Festival.
On the last Wednesday of August every year, the town of Bunol, Valencia, in Spain, becomes the stage for the worlds largest food fight.
Up to fifty thousand tourists flood the town to take part in the traditional tomato fight, which lasts from around midday until 1 p.m. An estimated 150,000 tomatoes are thrown, kicked, and splattered, covering everything and everyone with red pulp and seeds.
The festival began in 1945, but nobody knows for sure why.
Some claim that the first tomato fight took place among a small group of friends and that the event snowballed from there.
Others say its origin was political and that the first tomatoes were thrown by townspeople unhappy with the performance of their local city council.
A third theory is that the first tomato fight resulted from an angry confrontation between the giant figures in a carnival parade and the local kids.
Anyway, whatever its origin, La Tomatina, as it is now called, is one of the most popular and bizarre festivals in Europe.
The week-long festival features music, dancing, parades, and other fun activities.
On the evening before the actual fight starts, there is a huge paella-cooking contest.
Then, on the day of the tomato battle, before the tomato throwing begins, members of the crowd attempt to climb a tall greasy pole, on the top of which is a ham.
This can take a while as the climbers slip and slide on the pole.
Only when someone successfully retrieves the ham can the tomato fight begin.
Early Wednesday morning, shopkeepers along the plaza set about covering their windows and doors in preparation for the messy attack.
The start of the fight is signaled by the firing of water cannons, and trucks carrying the tomatoes pull into the town.
The tomatoes are specially grown nearby and dont taste good, presumably so that nobody is tempted to eat them instead of throwing them.
In the fight itself there are no rules except that fighters should crush the tomatoes before throwing them.
Many people wear goggles to keep tomato juice out of their eyes.
At 1 p.m., the water cannons are fired again and the battle ends.
Then the cleanup begins, with fire trucks hosing down the streets, the buildings, and the people!
Its clear that everyone in Bunol has a terrific time at the tomato festival.
Its good, messy fun, and participants can enjoy a really good food fight.
