Unit 1 Dreams for the Future.
Whenever I recall my childhood years, a smile would appear on my face.
My friends and I would spend hours playing in the playground, and sometimes, we would speculate about what we wanted to be when we grew up.
I had my heart set on becoming a movie star, and my friends contemplated becoming scientists, doctors, and enterprisers in the future.
I used to reckon that every child had big dreams, but after watching the documentary film entitled Children of the World about children from various countries, I realized that not all children lead a carefree life as we do.
In fact, some poor children cant even pay attention to their schoolwork because they need to slave away for hours at difficult jobs.
For example, the film shows a boy in Bolivia who has to work long hours in a coal mine so that he can pay his tuition.
In another section, the film also covers a story of a group of kids in Tibet.
Up in the mountains, they are isolated from the rest of the world, without any access to the Internet.
These Tibetan childrens goals are worlds apart from those of Taiwanese children.
They spend a lot of time meditating every day and hope to penetrate the meaning of life.
However, out of all the children featured in this film, a youngster named Sandeep Shahani impressed me the most.
Sandeep is from India.
He is only about twelve years old, and he grows up in difficult circumstances.
In the Indian language, his family name literally means boatman. When asked about his future, Sandeep says that the only thing he intends to do is to follow in his fathers footsteps and become a boatman.
Sandeep works around the clock, rowing passengers across the river for a trifling sumXperhaps NT$2 or NT$3 per trip.
To me, it seems that he leads a miserable life.
Since he makes so little money, he is likely to stay in his hometown all his life, and he will probably never get the chance to see the world.
Later, I learned that the caste system may be the main reason why Sandeep doesnt hold out much hope of working in a different occupation.
The caste system is a system in India that classifies people into groups depending on which family they are born into, and it has existed for centuries.
Sandeep may find some consolation in the fact that he is not a member of the lowest class, in which people are destined for an even harsher life full of inequality and mistreatment.
Life is so despicable for them that they cannot imagine ever being treated fairly, let alone in a respectable way.
Watching this film and seeing how Sandeep and other children live made me feel fortunate for all the things I have.
Living such difficult lives, these children seem to stand no chance of dreaming big.
For them, doing so would be nothing more than building castles in the air.
Their dreams, in fact, can be deemed ordinary or insignificant by some people.
Nevertheless, these children have made repeated attempts to fulfill their dreams.
I couldnt but appreciate how fantastic these children are.
The fact that they work hard and try their best even though they are living under unfavorable circumstances serves as an incentive for me to follow through with my own dreams.
It has dawned on me that it doesnt matter whether our dreams are big or small as long as we dont set a limit on ourselves.
There is always a possibility of achieving our dreams.
