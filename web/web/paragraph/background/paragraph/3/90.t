Unit 9  The Wonderful World of Hayao Miyazaki.
Many people have heard of Hayao Miyazaki, a gifted Japanese animator, and his internationally acclaimed films.
His films, such as My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, and Howls Moving Castle, have captured the interest of people of all ages around the world.
However, when it comes to the elements found in his films, most people probably dont know that many of these elements actually date back to Miyazakis childhood.
One distinctive characteristic of Miyazakis films is the presence of strong female characters.
Take Chihiro, the ten-year-old main character in Spirited Away, for example.
Separated from her parents and forced to face numerous monsters and witches, she must share her love so that she can overcome several obstacles and save her parents.
Chihiros adventure transforms her from a spoiled, whiny child into a responsible, capable girl, and the whole process is similar to the maturation that occurred in Miyazakis life.
When Miyazaki was about six, his mother contracted tuberculosis.
Her treatment continued during his teenage years, and this meant that Miyazaki had to care for his two younger brothers.
As a result, Miyazaki drew pictures and made up stories to entertain them.
Gradually, he developed keen drawing skills, a fertile imagination, and the ability to convey stories through images.
But for his unusual childhood circumstances, Miyazaki might never have gone on creating so many entrancing animated films.
Another early influence on Miyazaki was the work of his father and uncle in the aviation industry.
As he was a child, Miyazaki spent hours drawing planes.
This led to his lifelong interest in flying.
After he started to create his own works, flying naturally became a recurring theme.
Miyazakis various flying vehicles include a witchs broom, massive military vessels, and so onXoften with emphasis on designs that were never, or could never be, possible in real life.
Without his early exposure to aviation, Miyazaki would not have been so inspired by flying.
Miyazakis films stand out also because his characters reflect reality.
The characters of Miyazakis films, unlike those of most typical Hollywood animated films, are neither completely righteous nor completely wicked, which is very true to life and makes his films one of a kind.
As a story unfolds, villains reveal certain positive traits, as well as their violence, evil, and hatred.
Good and bad fuse together, and the tension between them gives richness and complexity to Miyazakis stories.
These stories illustrate that there are always positive things worth living for: joy to be found, a peaceful resolution to be attempted, and love to be embraced.
With these unique characteristics, Miyazakis films have not only achieved commercial success in Japan, but also won praise from moviegoers and critics alike around the world.
At the ceremony for the 2002 Academy Awards, the award for Best Animated Feature went to Spirited Away, the first Japanese animated film ever to win an Oscar.
Renowned as an imaginative animator, Miyazaki has remained true to his own ideals and beliefs, which are expressed in each of his extraordinary productions.
Without a doubt, he will keep on leaving audiences in awe with the wonderful worlds he creates in his works.
