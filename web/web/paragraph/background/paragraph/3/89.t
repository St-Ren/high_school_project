Unit 8  Waste Not, Want Not.
Recent visitors to Haiti may be shocked to find a scene that has become common for many of the local residents: locals eating mud cakes.
Made with clay and a little margarine and salt, these cakes are used by Haitians to keep their hunger at bay.
Mud cakes are definitely not delicious, and the heavy metals and parasites that they contain have greatly affected the health of the Haitians who eat them.
Sad to say, there seems to be no quick solution to this situation.
Owing to catastrophic domestic crop shortages and the soaring prices of imported goods, not to mention the terrible earthquake of 2010, Haiti has been listed as one of the worlds hungriest countries.
Moreover, farmers in Haiti arent able to grow food fast enough to feed every islander, which makes this country even hungrier than ever.
Unfortunately, food crises have broken out not just in HaitiXthey have occurred around the globe.
According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than thirty nations have long endured famine-like conditions.
To compare and contrast what people eat, writer Faith DAluisio and photographer Peter Menzel visited several places and spent months examining the diets of 30 different families in 24 countries.
The Aboubakars, the family that DAluisio and Menzel stayed with in Chad, ate about $24.40 worth of food a week.
The bulk of their weekly diet consisted of 39.3 pounds of sorghum.
Other items for the family of six to share included five small limes, around seven pounds of vegetables and nuts, and about two liters of sunflower oil.
With no access to dairy, their only luxuries were salt, pepper, and a handful of ginger for flavor.
DAluisio and Menzel also visited one family in the United States: the Revis in North Carolina.
If we compare the Aboubakars weekly diet with the Revis, the mind will boggle at the differences between the two.
In one week, the Revis food expenditure exceeded $340.
They enjoyed a variety of grains and starches.
They consumed milk, butter, several kinds of cheese, meat, fish, and all the fruits and vegetables they wanted.
Whats more, the money they spent on drinks, such as juice, soda, and alcohol, to name but a few, was $77.75, which is over three times the amount of the total food budget of the Aboubakars.
Serious as it is in some parts of the world, the problem of food shortages is actually preventable.
In 2009, a study carried out by the United Nations Environment Programme mentioned that over half of the worlds food was wasted.
About one quarter of fruit and vegetables in the United States were thrown away, and one third of food in the United Kingdom did not get eaten.
In Toronto, Canada, each family produces an average of 606 kilograms of waste annually, which works out at 441 million kilograms of food waste for this city.
If the worlds food supply is more carefully managed, the amount saved will be large enough to feed every hungry person on the planet.
In Taiwan, food shortages may not seem as urgent as those in Haiti.
However, some people in Taiwan, like those in other countries, do not cherish their food.
If they keep wasting food, they are bound to face food shortages sooner or later.
To prevent this from happening, some minor adjustments can be made and, better yet, help to improve the problem of food shortages around the world.
For instance, we can start by assessing our food needs, and then purchase just what we require every time we shop.
When we dine at an all-you-can-eat restaurant, we should make sure that our eyes are not bigger than our stomach, so that we wont put too much food on our tray.
These are just a few examples; the list can go on and on.
What counts is that we should keep this global issue in mind and stop ourselves from wasting food.
With just a little effort, the global food crisis will not become a problem that is too big to be tackled.
