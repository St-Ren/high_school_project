Hello, Kitty!
 Hello Kitty is the best-known symbol of Japanese kawaii, or cuteness.
Since the 1970s, kawaii has become a prominent aspect of Japanese popular culture, entertainment, clothing, food, toys, personal appearance, and behavior.
The everyday landscape of Tokyothe advertisements on the subway, store signs, digital display screens, and various forms of mass media like manga (Japanese comics) and fashion magazinesis filled with cute stuff.
As a cultural phenomenon, cuteness is increasingly accepted in Japan as a part of Japanese culture and national identity.
Nobuyoshi Kurita, professor at Musashi University in Tokyo, has stated that kawaii is a "magic term" that includes everything that is acceptable and desirable in Japan.
Almost any cute cartoon character is an excellent sell in Japan.
Many different types of companies, big and small, have licensed characters like Kitty or imports such as Snoopy and Miffy to jazz up their advertising.
For example, Pikachu, a character from Pokmon, adorns the side of three All Nippon Airways passenger planes.
Spend five minutes in shopping centers like Shibuya and Shinjuku, and you almost feel as if you were in a cartoon town.
 Cuteness sells big in Japan.
Take Hello Kitty for example.
The simple image of the white cat with the big head has
been put on 20,000 products from book
bags and card-holders to toasters and
There is even a Hello Kitty
amusement park near Tokyo.
Kitty alone generates about half
of Tokyo-based Sanrio's US$1
billion profit every year.
Kawaii not only sells in Japan.
Cute merchandise and products are
especially popular in other parts of East
Asia as well, such as China, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, and South Korea.
Kids from South
Korea have become Japan-crazy, starting with fashion and music.
Hong Kongers and Taiwanese find Japanese culture more attractive than that from the west.
The kawaii, but otherwise untalented, teen idols produced by the Japanese pop industry can be easily seen in karaoke bars all over Asia.
However, some people think kawaii is not just a marketing gimmick.
It is deeply rooted in Japanese culture and manifests itself in social and gender roles, particularly those of young Japanese women.
Cuteness isn't just a fashion statementpink lipstick, butterfly hair bands, and fluffy bagsit is
also a type of behavior.
Cute girls often pout, act silly, speak in childish voices, and stamp their feet when they are angry.
Even boys are getting into the cute look.
The latest trend: Japanese boys are shaving their legs for the summer, short-pants season.
Some Japanese feminists charge that all this cute style is really about the cultural domination and exploitation of women in the country.
It encourages girls and young women well into their late twenties to act obedient, weak, and innocent rather than mature, confident, and independent.
 Is kawaii so uncute?
Kazuhiko Sato, the chief editor of Cawaii magazine, which has a circulation of about 300,000 and a target audience of 15 to 19-year-olds or so, thinks the power of cuteness will be around in Japan for a very long time, and he does not think there is anything unhealthy or negative about any of this.
When asked if the power of cuteness and Hello Kitty are turning Japanese girls into obedient little bunnies, Sato said, "I don't think girls are acting in an obedient way at all.
They're trying to be cute to get more attention from the boys."
After all, cuteness conquers all.
