For many people, there seems to be no escape from poverty.
Imagine a poor woman who has an idea for a small business to lift herself and her family out of poverty.
She goes to a bank to borrow a little money.
At this bank, as at most banks, the borrower must meet three criteria: character (being honest), capacity (being able to run a business), and collateral (owning something valuable).
However, the bank wont lend the money to this poor woman because she doesnt have any collateral.
In such a situation, there seems to be no way for the woman to break the cycle of poverty.
One possible solution these days is microlendingwa system of special banks and programs that are loaning money to people in borrowing groups. For example, an international organization called Good Faith lends small amounts of money to people who want to go into business.
Each person must do two things first: take classes in business and join a borrowing group.
Everyone in the group must approve the loan of every other group member.
They must have character and capacity in the business classes.
Collateral is not necessary any longer.
Instead, group members make sure that each person pays back his or her loan.
Good Faith has had many successes and only a few failures.
In Pine Bluff, Arkansas, a small town in the U.S.A., one person was able to open a hair salon, another a plant shop, and still another, a car-decorating businesswall with loans from Good Faith.
In developing countries such as Bangladesh, a person can buy a cow or a sewing machine and begin a small business with only $20 to $50.
Because of many small loans from Good Faith, there are now 1.6 million new entrepreneurs in Bangladesh helping to improve the countrys economy.
Of course, not all these loans were a success.
At first, Good Faith lent half of the money to men and half to women.
Unfortunately, most of the Bangladeshi men spent the money on themselves, not the business.
Now Good Faith does business mainly with womens borrowing groups in that country.
The primary goal of Good Faith and other similar programs is to eliminate poverty.
However, as poverty has decreased, there have been some surprising secondary effects.
One of them has been a change in the social status of women.
Traditionally, in some societies, people thought of women as worthless.
But when a woman is eligible for loans and is able to demonstrate her capacity for business, she often receives respect from the male members of her family and from the entire village.
Therefore, women can elevate their position in addition to bringing wealth into the family and society when given a chance.
In many countries, women are the poorest of the poor.
They produce more than half of the worlds food, but they own just one percent of the worlds land.
They comprise 51 percent of the worlds population, but very little money goes to programs to help them.
Therefore, besides organizations creating borrowing groups for women, others fund special projects to help women.
In the late 1980s, Anne F. Murray began the Global Fund for Women.
It has authorized money for over 400 womens groups in 94 countries.
The main focus is to help find solutions to social ills such as violence and lack of education.
For instance, the fund has helped a group of Palestinian and Jewish women who are working together to stop violence against women.
It is giving money to a woman in a village in southern India who has started a literacy program to teach poor women to read.
Good Faith and the Global Fund for Women have taught banks around the world that it is a safe bet to lend money to some of the poor.
With careful planning, education, and cooperation, most people use the money well and then plow the money and knowledge back into their communities.
There is considerable hope that they can begin to break the cycle of poverty for themselves, their families, and society.
