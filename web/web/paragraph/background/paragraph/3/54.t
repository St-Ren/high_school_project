Making Scents of Perfume.
Do you know what happened when archeologists unsealed the tomb of King Tut, the Egyptian Pharaoh?
To their surprise, no sooner had they unsealed the tomb than an aroma that they would never forget came out of it.
From the remains of the neatly wrapped mummy, delicate pottery gave off a soft scent.
The scent the archeologists had discovered came from a kind of incense.
This was the most famous Egyptian fragrance and the oldest evidence of perfume so far discovered.
Egyptians associated incense with godliness.
By filling rooms with it, they believed that the gods would look more favorably on them.
In fact, they were so obsessed with fragrance that they bathed in oil mixed with aromatic plants as well as other spices.
During the eleventh century, an Arabian doctor discovered how to obtain oil directly from plants and flowers through distillation.
This method of evaporating water led to more complicated mixtures and more subtle scents, and offered more precise control over the results.
Perfume was gradually transformed from a religious product into a vanity product that symbolized wealth, prestige, and most importantly, beauty.
People just couldnt get enough of itXfood was flavored with rose perfumes, drinks tasted of lilies, and coffee was brewed with jasmine.
People even soaked their clothing in perfume and sprayed their furniture and rugs with it!
By the end of the nineteenth century, people had started to use synthetic substances because of the high costs of obtaining natural ingredients to make fragrances.
This reduced costs and paved the way for commercial sales.
To ensure the quality of each artificial smell, experts known as perfumers were born.
A perfumer, also called a nose, is an artist who is trained to detect the subtlest differences between fragrances.
Perfumers are also capable of associating abstract concepts and moods with fragrance compositions.
Sometimes perfumes are formulated to smell like nature, with floral or woody ingredients, and sometimes like an abstract concept such as obsession or a love spell.
In order to preserve all of the wonderfully created scents, something equally wonderful was needed.
Egyptians originally kept perfume in pottery.
After glass was developed, people considered it the perfect material for making perfume bottles.
Perfume and perfume bottles go together like humans and their souls.
Each bottle is a physical manifestation of the finely crafted fragrance within.
A light-purple bottle with a crystal butterfly on top captures the carefree feeling of playing in a meadow of lavender.
A stylish bottle that mimics a beautiful gown gives the impression that an elegant lady may apply this fragrance to her neck and wrists.
Today there is a wide variety of perfumes to choose from.
There are bold musky fragrances for men and sophisticated floral scents for ladies.
Even fruits are being used to create sweet aromas for everyday use and to attract younger customers.
Many celebrities are also creating fragrances for their fans to wearX scents the celebrities feel best represent them.
To select the perfume that is perfect for you, simply close your eyes and follow your nose.
