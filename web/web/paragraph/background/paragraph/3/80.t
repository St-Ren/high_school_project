Unit 10  Words Can Hurt.
It is a widely acknowledged truth that words have power.
When people say mean or rude things to us, their words may end up hurting our feelings.
It should come as no surprise, then, that most of us have encountered verbal abuse.
Seen from this point of view, verbal abuse is actually quite common.
What many of us may never have anticipated, nonetheless, is how greatly verbal abuse can affect us.
In fact, scientific research has demonstrated that verbal abuse is not only emotionally damaging, but also physically harmful.
Verbal abuse occurs when someone says something impolite or offensive, especially when that person is angry, and it can take many forms.
Sometimes it is an active assault, as when a boss tells an employee off by saying that he or she is an idiot for failing to meet a deadline, or when a student is mocked, taunted, or harassed by his or her classmates for being different.
The family is probably the last place that most people expect verbal abuse to happen in, but it happens there as well when a parent insults or scolds a child regularly.
Verbal abuse can also be passive, and this type of abuse takes place when a parent ignores a child or frequently discounts the childs opinions.
For those who have been exposed to verbal abuse, it is highly likely that they will have low self-esteem and may be plagued by emotional problems, such as anxiety or depression.
At times, the scars are so deep that some victims begin to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.
Left depressed and without hope, these people run an increased risk of committing suicide.
Additionally, victims of verbal abuse often wind up inflicting this pain on other people.
They do so mainly because this is the only means of expression that they know.
In other cases, the cycle of abuse continues because a victim may unconsciously want to regain power, and becoming an abuser is one way to do this.
Recent studies have also uncovered the long-term physical damage that verbal abuse can cause.
One study focused on the brains of the verbally abused.
Examining the brain scans of these victims, researchers discovered that these victims brains looked much like those of disabled people.
In some cases, the trauma of verbal abuse even caused the left side of the brain to stop developing, which often leads to a permanent decline in memory.
There is also evidence that verbal abuse can reduce language ability as well as diminish the senses.
Perhaps it is time to reexamine the old saying, Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me. While it is true that most wounds will heal eventually, the mental scars that result from verbal abuse can run very deep.
Sadly, the suffering is often the last thing that people are able to recover from.
Therefore, we should always bear in mind that our words can hurt and as a consequence choose our words very wisely before we utter them.
After all, once hurtful things have been said, it is never easy to take them back.
