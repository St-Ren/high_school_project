The Google Guys.
In 1996, two graduate students at Stanford University had a grand dream.
Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to make information available to everybody.
They started a research project together and, two years later, started a company in a friends garage.
Today they are billionaires, and that company is Google.
Google is a search engineXa way of searching for information on the Internet.
In 1996, there were already several search engines, but Page and Brin believed they had a better technique for searching the Web, so they created Google.
Google comes from the word googol, which is a 1 with 100 zeros after it.
Everybody loved Google because it was fast and easy to use.
More and more people began to use it, and the company grew quickly.
Eventually, so many people were using Google that in 2006 the verb google was added to the dictionary.
Today, more than two-thirds of computer users use Google, and the Google search engine receives about a billion search requests a day.
Sergey Brin was born in Russia in August 1973.
His family immigrated to the United States when he was six and settled in Maryland.
Brin became interested in computers and math when he was very young, and his parents encouraged him.
His father was a mathematics professor, and his mother worked for NASA.
In school, Brin was a star in the chess club and on the math team, but he also loved to have fun and to play jokes on people.
He received a bachelors degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Maryland.
He then went to Stanford and earned a masters degree.
From there, he entered Stanfords Ph.D.12 program.
The rest is history.
Larry Page was born in Michigan in March 1973.
His parents were both computer scientists.
As a boy, Page idolized Nikola Tesla, the inventor of the AC system of electricity.
He says he fell in love with computers at age six.
He was a brilliant boy and was often smarter than even his best teachers.
Everyone knew he would do something great one day.
Page got a bachelors degree in computer engineering from the University of Michigan.
He earned a masters degree from Stanford before entering their Ph.D. program.
When Page and Brin met, they didnt like each other very much, but soon they realized that they had an interest in commonXmaking a better search engine.
Without these two wonder boys, there would be no Google.
The success of Google, however, comes mostly from its special corporate culture.
Page and Brin didnt want their company to be like other big corporations.
Their motto was Dont be evil. They didnt want the company to hurt people or the planet in any way.
For example, the company uses solar energy.
About one-third of the electricity they need is produced by solar panels installed on the roofs of the buildings.
They also try to create a fun and enjoyable atmosphere at the company.
The main lobby of Googles headquarters is decorated with a piano and colorful lamps from the 1960s.
The hallways are full of toys and sports equipment, such as exercise balls and bicycles.
And all of the employees can use the companys recreational facilities.
These include exercise rooms, video games, and a roller rink.
Theres also a pool table, Foosball, Ping-Pong, and a baby grand piano.
The company even gives its employees free snacks and cereals as well as juices, sodas, and coffee.
Page and Brin never believed in creating a strict and formal atmosphere.
If you visited Googleplex, you would see employees playing games and having fun.
Of course, they also do work.
But to promote creative thinking, all Google engineers are encouraged to spend one day a week on any project that interests them.
This has actually worked out very well for the company.
Engineers have created several new Google services during these periods.
Google also has a tradition of playing April Fools jokes.
In 2002, they claimed that pigeons were the secret behind their successful search engine.
In 2004, they put up Google Lunar, which advertised jobs on the moon.
In 2005, they advertised a new drink called Google Gulp that was supposed to improve the brain.
Every year there is a clever new joke.
One year, around the first of April, they brought out a new e-mail service called Gmail.
Everyone thought it was a joke!
The success of Google and its founders is no joke, however.
Google continues to grow and has bought several smaller companies.
It continues to improve on its products and services, and it has created many new ones, such as Google News, Google Earth, Google Maps, and Google Video.
In 2007, Google bought the online video site YouTube.
Page and Brin are now among the richest men in the world.
Nevertheless, you can still catch Page going to work on his in-line skates or snapping together a robot with his Lego bricks.
And you can still see Brin with a mischievous look in his eyes, thinking up a clever new trick.
