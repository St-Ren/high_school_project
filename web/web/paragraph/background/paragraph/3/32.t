Do you ever feel unhappy when somebody gives you a compliment?
It does happen sometimes, especially when you know the speaker doesn't mean what he or she says.
Chances are people may say one thing but mean another.
In real life, we may rely on facial expressions, body language, or the circumstances to decipher what the speaker really intends to say.
However, when reading poems, we may need to read every word closely to determine the tone of the speaker.
Often when we first encounter a poem, we start by inquiring, "What is it all about?"
We want to know what the subject of the poem is, be it love or death.
But to fully comprehend a poem, we need to explore the speaker's attitude toward the subject, which is made clear from the "tone" of the speaker's voice.
Since the speaker does not really talk to us in person, the tone of his or her voice is manifested through many subtle arrangements, such as certain choices of words or unusual punctuation.
One way to help you clarify the tone is to listen to the voice as if someone were talking to you.
We may try to know more about this person and visualize his or her existence by asking the following questions:
Who is the speaker in the poem?
A petulant teenager or a miserable housewife?
How does the speaker's voice sound?
Happy or sad?
Enthusiastic or cold?
Does the poem suggest an attitude or emotion?
If so, what is it?
What adjective would best describe the tone of the voice?
Regretful or optimistic?
Indifferent or emotional?
To some extent, the tone of the speaker is the soul of a poem, and only when it is properly grasped can we claim to have a thorough understanding of the poem.
Now we are going to read two poems, both concerning the loss of someone important.
Read them closely, and see how each reveals the speaker's feelings about, or attitude toward, this significant event.
The art of losing isn't hard to master;
so many things seem filled with the intent
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.
Lose something every day.
Accept the fluster
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.
The art of losing isn't hard to master.
Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
places, and names, and where it was you meant
to travel.
None of these will bring disaster.
I lost my mother's watch.
my last, or
next-to-last, of three loved houses went.
The art of losing isn't hard to master.
I lost two cities, lovely ones.
And, vaster,
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.
I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.
Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
I love) I shan't have lied.
It's evident
the art of losing's not too hard to master
though it may look like (Write it!)
like disaster.
Elizabeth Bishop(-)
You have grown wings of pain
and flap around the bed like a wounded gull
calling for water, calling for tea, for grapes
whose skins you cannot penetrate
Remember when you taught me
how to swim?
Let go, you said,
the lake will hold you up.
I long to say, Father let go
and death will hold you up.
Outside the fall goes on without us.
How easily the leaves give in,
I hear them on the last breath of wind,
passing this disappearing place.
