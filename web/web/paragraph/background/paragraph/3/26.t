The Tiny World of the Future.
What do you think the following products might have in common: a pair of stain-resistant pants, a type of sun cream, and an iPod?
The answer is that all of them, to some degree, have been manufactured with the help of nanotechnology.
Some clothing fabrics have been coated with tiny fibers that prevent dirt from getting through to the lower layers of the material.
Some brands of sunscreen use nanotechnology in a similar way to block out harmful ultraviolet rays.
And the displays on iPods, as well as some cellphones, laptops, and flat screen TVs, are made from plastic films built on the nanoscale.
So what exactly is the nanoscale?
You may have seen amazing photographs taken through microscopes of things like hairs and bacteria.
These photos are on a scale just millionths of a meter in width.
The nanoscale is at an even smaller level.
Nano means billionth, so the nanoscale is a billion times smaller than the world of meters and kilometers that we live in.
To compare measurements, a 180-centimeter-tall man is 1.8 billion nanometers tall.
A typical atom is around 0.1 nanometers in size.
Therefore, operating on the nanoscale involves working with and manipulating atoms to create new things at the molecular level.
One exciting example of nanotechnology is the development of carbon nanotubes.
These are rod-shaped carbon molecules that are about one nanometer across.
They are bonded together in a dense structure that makes them very strong, stronger than steel.
Nanotubes can, in theory, be made into materials of any length.
Recently, NASA scientists suggested carbon nanotubes could be used to make a gigantic elevator stretching all the way from Earth into space.
Though such applications lie in the future, nanotubes have already been used in such things as tennis rackets and bicycles, making them stronger without making them heavier.
Researchers are also hopeful about the potential of nanotechnology in the field of medicine.
It is thought that tiny machines called nanobots will be able to move around inside the human body, detecting health problems such as cancer and transmitting information about them.
For the time being, however, there are too many problems in designing a machine that can zoom through the bloodstream, so medical nanobots remain in the realm of science fiction.
As the benefits of nanotechnology become clearer, some scientists are sounding a note of caution.
They are concerned that nanoscale objects might cause harm to the environment and living things.
Tiny particles, for instance, can become toxic to the human body.
It has been pointed out that all chemical fertilizers were considered safe when first used, and the harmful effects of some were discovered only decades later.
Nobody really knows whether new nanosubstances might have the same potential for danger.
Careful research is needed to prevent the dream of a nanotech world from turning into a nano-nightmare.
