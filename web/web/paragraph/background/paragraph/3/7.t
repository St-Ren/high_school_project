Three Days to See.
I have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days at some time during his early adult life.
Darkness would make him more
appreciative of sight; silence would teach him the joys of sound.
Now and then I have tested my seeing friends to discover what they see.
Recently I was visited by a very good friend who had just returned from a long walk in the woods, and I asked her what she had observed.
Nothing in particular, she replied.
I might have been incredulous had I not been accustomed to such responses, for long ago I became convinced that the seeing see little.
How was it possible, I asked myself, to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing worthy of note?
I, who cannot see, find hundreds of things to interest me through mere touch.
I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf.
I pass my hands lovingly about the smooth skin of a silver birch, or the rough, shaggy bark of a pine.
In spring I touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud, the first sign of awakening Nature after her winters sleep.
Occasionally, if I am very fortunate, I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel the happy quiver of a bird in full song.
I am delighted to have the cool waters of a brook rush through my open fingers.
To me a lush carpet of pine needles or spongy grass is more welcome than the most luxurious Persian rug.
At times my heart cries out with longing to see all these things.
If I can get so much pleasure from mere touch, how much more beauty must be revealed by sight.
Yet, those who have eyes apparently see little.
The panorama of color and action which fills the world is taken for granted.
It is human, perhaps, to appreciate little that which we have and to long for that which we have not, but it is a great pity that in the world of light the gift of sight is used only as a mere convenience rather than as a means of adding fullness to life.
If, by some miracle, I
were granted three seeing days,
I should want to see the people whose kindness and gentleness and companionship have made my life worth living.
First I should like to gaze long upon the face of my dear teacher, Mrs. Anne Sullivan Macy, who came to me when I was a child and opened the outer world to me.
I should want not merely to see the outline of her face, so that I could cherish it in my memory, but to study that face and find in it the living evidence of the sympathetic tenderness and patience with which she accomplished the difficult task of my education.
I should like to see in her eyes that strength of character which has enabled her to stand firm in the face of difficulties, and that compassion for all humanity which she has revealed to me so often.
I do not know what it is to see into the heart of a friend through that window of the soul, the eye.
I can only see through my finger tips the outline of a face.
I can detect laughter, sorrow, and many other obvious emotions.
I know my friends from the feel of their faces.
But I cannot really picture their personalities through the thoughts they express to me, through whatever of their actions are revealed to me.
I am denied that deeper understanding of them which I am sure would come through sight of them, through watching their reactions to various expressions and circumstances, through noting the immediate and fleeting reactions of their eyes and countenance.
How much easier, how much more satisfying it is for you who can see to grasp quickly the essential qualities of another person by watching the subtleties of expression, the quiver of a muscle, the flutter of a hand.
But does it ever occur to you to use your sight to
see the inner nature of a friend or acquaintance?
Do not most of you seeing people grasp casually the outward features of a face and let it go at that?
The eyes of seeing persons soon become accustomed to the routine of their surroundings, and they actually see only the startling and spectacular.
But even in viewing the most spectacular sights the eyes are lazy.
Some see more than others, but few see everything that is within the range of their vision.
I, who am blind, can give one hint to those who see: Use your eyes as if tomorrow you would be stricken blind.
And the same method can be applied to other senses.
Hear the music of voices and the song of a bird as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow.
Touch each object you want to touch as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail.
Smell the perfume of flowers, taste each morsel, as if tomorrow you could never smell and taste again.
Make the most of every sense.
But of all the senses, I am sure that sight must be the most delightful.
