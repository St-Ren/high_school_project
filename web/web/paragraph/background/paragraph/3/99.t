How the University Is Accountable to Parents and Students.
A Speech to Freshmen and Parents by Drew Faust, President of Harvard University.
Cambridge, Massachusetts.
October 26, 2007.
Hello, Class of 2011.
Welcome back.
Seven weeks ago you sat in this audience to begin a journeywa journey through four years of college with the most diverse group of classmates we have ever admitted.
On that day in September, I challenged the freshmen to explore the rich treasures of the University, to experience the stimulating energy of its museums and professors and research laboratories, and begin a life of risk and reward at Harvard.
In my opening address two weeks ago, I ventured a definition of what accountability means on campuswthat it means being accountable to the past and to the future, and not simply to the present.
A university has a longer view.
It is not about a report of the days gains and losses, but about endeavors we pursue in part for their own sake, because over the centuries they have defined what makes us human.
Today I want to focus on two things: first, we are accountable for teaching students well; second, we are accountable for helping students change for the better.
First, teaching.
Teaching is at the heart of what we do at a research university.
The students of Harvard College are not only part of a much larger place; they are at its core.
The faculty has always tried their best to assure that exceedingly outstanding teaching is a basic part of the undergraduate experience.
The extraordinary opportunities undergraduates find, no matter which college or institute you are at Harvard, come about not only because students wade right in, but because of pioneering scholars who care deeply about teaching.
Never has it been more important for faculty to embrace technology.
The Internet is changing the ways of learning, enhancing classroom teaching in unexpected and marvelous wayswnot replacing the essential exchange between teacher and student, but giving it new forms and rich variety.
Ninety percent of Harvard courses, 5,000 a year, have websites.
Discussion boards and blogs extend in-class discussion.
Online maps and archives are a click away.
Second, the University is accountable for delivering a different person, upon graduation, from the one who came to us as a freshman.
College is a place for students to cultivate a culture of unruliness, a zone of questioning and openness and new creation.
As W. B. Yeats put it, Education is not filling a bucket, but lighting a fire.
College is a time where one should dare to make mistakes, wrote senior Matthew Blumenthal for a New York Times essay contest this summer.
College should push the limits of students comfort zones in new and meaningful ways, he said.
These two sentences are similar to Mark Twains command to sail away from safe harbor. Exactly.
The graduating sons and daughters who leave here four years from now may have sailed far, far away from any land or harbor you ever imagined.
We are here to keep students on that journeywto help them make choices that may not make sense to you, or even to us, to encourage them to take risks, to put themselves to sea from the safe harbor.
This happens as much, if not more, outside the classroom than in.
It means that, you might study in Israel at a center for integrating archaeology and natural science; or spend a summer in Mexicos health ministry; or discover that you can start a program to help teenagers with disease in Ghana.
Once you are here, you realize that you belong, inspired by others who are similarly, passionately involved.
Such is the value of venturing beyond the bounds of the college.
You are the first freshmen I have welcomed as president of the University.
We begin our journeys together.
Journeys are never easy.
Dr. Samuel E. Morrison a legendary Harvard professor, also told us that in any journey of risk and reward, the joy is in the journey, bound to hold in store what he called long periods of pure delight such as only a seaman may know, and moments of high, proud happiness that only a discoverer can experience.
Thank you.
