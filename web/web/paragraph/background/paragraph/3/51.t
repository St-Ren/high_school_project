Rules That Work Wonders.
Have you ever walked into a house and felt at home right away?
Was it the furnishings that created a relaxed atmosphere?
Or was it the light and air that made you feel so comfortable?
Perhaps you weren't aware of it, but the answer might lie in good feng shui.
Feng shui, literally "wind water" in Chinese, means "natural surroundings."
It is the art of achieving harmony with the environment through the proper arrangement of the objects within and around the house.
It is also the practice of harnessing chi , an invisible flow of energy that surrounds us.
With smoothly flowing chi around, you can lead a life of happiness and prosperity.
According to the philosophy of feng shui, the most important room in a house is the bedroom, because where and how you sleep is important for preserving the strength and spirit you need to face the world.
To ensure the best flow of chi in the room, your bed should be diagonally opposite the room's main entrance.
This will give you the serene feelings that make proper rest possible.
If it is impossible to make such an arrangement, do bear in mind that you should never place your bed in alignment with the door, because in ancient China, the deceased were laid out with their feet pointing toward the door so that they would have easier access to heaven.
Besides, never put a bed under a slanting ceiling or exposed beams, because the angular protrusions will cause sha, or bad chi, which can give you pains, make your thoughts confused and perplexed, and cause you other problems Though mirrors have a positive effect in the other rooms of the home, it is the opposite case with the bedroom.
It is said that if a mirror faces your bed, your spirit, which may rise from your body at night, will be shocked when facing its own image.
Just as good feng shui in the bedroom can help you feel refreshed, so will good feng shui in your study promote your ability to concentrate.
According to the principles of feng shui, your study should be in the southern or northeastern corner of the house because the south represents fame and fortune; the northeast, knowledge and intelligence.
However, if this is not practicable, the position of your desk will be of crucial importance.
According to the rule mentioned above, your desk should be placed in the southern or northeastern corner of the room.
In addition, because a solid wall behind you can provide more backing for your ideas, sit with your back to the wall.
If this option is not available, be sure not to sit with your back to the door so that you won't be easily frightened by those who enter your room.
Also, don't position your desk facing the windows.
Ideally, windows should be to the side of your desk to avoid the glare of the sun.
Most importantly, if your room is next to a bathroom, never place your desk so that it is near the toilet, only separated from it by a wall.
The Chinese believe that they cannot change the destiny they are born with, but that they may change their luck with effort and wisdom.
Using the philosophy of feng shui, they may make wise and positive changes in their lives.
If you wish to assist yourself or your family in achieving your and their goals, use the principles of feng shui, and you will be amazed at how many windows are opened to you.
