Once upon a time, there was a king who had absolute power and a wild imagination.
However, he didn't kill his people at will like a barbarian.
Instead, he had his own unique way to let his people see that "justice" existed in his kingdom.
When a subject was accused of a serious crime, all the people would assemble at a vast amphitheater on a certain day.
The accused man would then be brought to the center of the arena.
Directly opposite him would be two doors that were exactly alike, side by side.
Behind one would be a fair lady and behind the other would be a fierce tiger.
The man on trial had to open one of the two doors and his choice would determine whether he was guilty or innocent.
When the door was opened, it might be the fierce tiger that sprang upon the man and tore him to pieces.
This was considered proof of his guilt.
Doleful bells would ring and the vast audience would walk slowly home with bowed heads.
But it might also be a lady, who would give her hand to the man.
The two would immediately be married in a grand ceremony to celebrate the man's innocence.
Brass bells would ring merrily and the people would be joyful.
The innocent man, preceded by children strewing flowers along his path, would lead his bride home.
Since the accused man was completely free to choose a door, the king considered this "justice" instead of what we might call "blind chance."
This king had a daughter whose soul was as wild, passionate, and imperious as her father's.
She had taken a handsome young man as her secret lover.
However, one day they were seen kissing each other.
The man was immediately cast into prison, and soon came the day when he too had to appear for his "trial" in the king's arena.
The most savage tiger to be found in the kingdom was brought there in a cage.
And a young lady who was considered the most tender and beautiful in the kingdom was also summoned.
Of course, everybody knew what the man had been accused of.
The day finally came and people swarmed into the amphitheater from far and wide.
All was ready.
The signal was given for the man to walk out.
He bowed to the king but looked at the face of the princess, who sat to the right of her father.
She must have known where the lady, or the tiger, hid.
The princess knew indeed.
But how could she hold back her jealousy and allow a beautiful young woman to take her lover away right before her eyes?
On the other hand, wouldn't it be a thousand times more awful to watch him being torn apart by a ferocious wild beast?
When the man turned and looked up at her, his anxious glance asked the question: "Which?"
The princess raised her right hand and made a slight, quick movement toward the right.
No one but her lover saw her hint.
He turned, and with a firm and rapid step, walked across the empty space.
Everyone held his breath and had his eyes fixed immovably on him.
Without the slightest hesitation, he went to the door on the right and opened it.
Now the question is this: Which came out of that door, the lady or the tiger?
