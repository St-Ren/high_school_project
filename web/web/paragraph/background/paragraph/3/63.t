Mysteries of the Past.
With all the vast knowledge and analytic powers of modern science, it seems there is very little that human beings do not or will not eventually know about the world.
Nevertheless, there are still things that we cannot explain and may never be able to.
Some of these are objects or structures that were made by other civilizations.
We can see these things and these places, but we still do not fully understand how or why they were created.
We might call them mysteries of the past.
Easter Island:
When European explorers first arrived on this remote Pacific island on Easter Day in 1722, they discovered a coast lined with hundreds of giant, god-like statues carved from volcanic rock, each of them facing away from the sea.
Their age is uncertain, but they are thought to date back to around A.D. 300.
That the completion of these statues required thousands of workers is obvious.
But in 1722 there were only a few hundred people living on the island, and they lived in primitive conditions.
So who made these statues?
It seems that a great civilization must once have inhabited Easter Island.
According to legend, the tribe that built the statues was wiped out in a vicious battle with another tribe during the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century.
However, some researchers claim that these statues were probably erected by rival tribes, each wanting to have more and larger statues than the other as a sign of status and wealth.
In any case, it is thought that the Easter Islanders chopped down palm trees to make rollers and sleds in order to move their statues, and that the existing civilization finally collapsed because of this overuse of natural resources.
The Nasca Lines:
This huge arrangement of straight lines and drawings of birds and animals was carved into the desert near the Andes Mountains in Peru beginning around 500 B.C.
The total design took a thousand years to complete.
The patterns are only clearly visible from the air.
Covering more than five hundred square kilometers, they have been called the biggest drawings ever created.
It is amazing that the ancient Nascan people could have had such highly developed surveying skills.
It is possible, scientists believe, that they invented the earliest hot air balloons, which they could have used to survey the land and plan the drawings.
Why they created them is another mystery.
Drawings on pottery pieces dug up by archaeologists, and the ancient technique of weaving developed by the Nascan people, have given researchers insight into what the purpose of the lines might have been.
Like other ancient designs and structures, they may have had some religious or ritualistic function, perhaps as a way of communicating with the gods.
Machu Picchu:
High up in the Andes Mountains, Macchu Picchu has been called a lost city ever since it was rediscovered by American explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911.
In fact, it was a recreational and religious site rather than a city, being the former summer palace of an Inca king.
Its majesty, and its mystery, lie in its spectacular location.
Machu Picchu was a carefully laid-out area of houses and temples, all supported by a network of underground walls.
It was completed around 1450, and is thought to have housed around 750 people.
Since the city stood near the top of a mountain at a height of almost three thousand meters, it is almost impossible to imagine how the Incas managed to transport the large stones used to build it.
Whats more, though some of the building blocks weighed over fifty tons, they were cut and joined together with incredible precision, and without mortar.
The ruins of Macchu Picchu are one of the worlds most beautiful and enigmatic archeological sites.
Teotihuacan:
About fifty kilometers north of Mexico City lies the valley where men become gods. That is the meaning of the Aztec name Teotihuacan, believed to have been the sixth largest city in the world at its peak in A.D. 600.
Though the Aztecs named Teotihuacan, they did not live there, but instead considered it the place where the world was created.
In fact, it is not known who built Teotihuacan, or why it went into decline and was abandoned by A.D. 750.
In its heyday, the city had a population of around 200,000.
It was beautifully built and much more impressive than any European city of the time.
Its centerpiece was an enormous, 2.5-kilometer-long boulevard known to the Aztecs as the Avenue of the Dead.
On either side of it stand huge platforms, and two pyramids large enough to rival those of ancient Egypt.
The culture and history of those who built them remain a mystery.
These are just a few of the mysterious creations of ancient humans.
Others exist all over the world.
Taken together, these mysteries point to other questions.
For one thing, how were people inspired to create such structures?
That is, where did this impulse come from?
Here is another question to ponder: will the statues and buildings we erect today also become a mystery to future humans?
