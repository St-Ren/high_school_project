Much More Than Just a Telephone.
The arrival of the telephone in the late nineteenth century changed long-distance communication forever.
Its successor, the cellphone, has had an even greater impact on the world in the last two decades.
It is now as much a part of modern life as the TV and the car, and we can barely imagine life without it.
Its advantages are obvious.
By providing instant contact from almost any place at any time, cellphones have greatly increased day-to-day convenience.
More importantly, they help save lives, making emergency services more accessible and often playing a key role in search-and-rescue operations.
They can be traced geographically using navigation tools and GPS, and many missing people have been found due to their cellphones.
If you have been using cellphones for a few years, you will appreciate how far theyve come in a short time.
You can already take and send pictures and videos with one, as well as send text messages, download ringtones, and even do some Web surfing.
At the same time, they have gotten smaller, slimmer, and lighter.
Apples iPhone, now into its fourth generation, has been a pioneer among smartphones and now has over 350,000 applications, or apps, available for download.
Taiwans HTC corporation has produced smartphones based on the Windows operating system, as well as for Googles Android.
The level of sophistication and functions of these handheld devices are now close to those of a PC.
And the cellphones of tomorrow are set to be capable of even more, as well as looking like nothing youve seen before.
Before long, you may be able to buy a communications device that is as thin as a sheet of paper and can be worn on the wrist.
In fact, there is already a flexible touch-screen display called ClearPad.
It can be wrapped around a cellphone like paper, and unwrapped to view images on a larger screen.
The biggest drawback to looking at images on a cellphone has always been the tiny screen.
But the time is coming when cellphones will work as projectors.
A company called MicroVision is developing one such device.
You will be able to point your phone at a white wall and watch a movie almost as if you were at a theater.
Other potential developments include cellphones that can be used for remote control.
Imagine being able to turn on the air conditioning while you are on your way home, so that you can arrive at a house that is already cool and comfortable.
And wouldnt it be great to have a video chat function, a cellphone that can be used as a credit card or that can store files and documents like a computer, or even an always-connected video game console?
The possibilities seem unlimited.
Pretty soon, it will be inaccurate to call them phones at all.
They will be multipurpose devices that just happen to make phone calls.
We will be carrying our world around with us.
