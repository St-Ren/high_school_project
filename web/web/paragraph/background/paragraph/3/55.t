Dina Fosseys Gorillas in the Mist.
In a dense forest in Uganda, Africa, Dian Fossey was with a group of gorillas she had been studying.
A huge 450-pound male gorilla named Peanuts sat down near her.
Fossey raised one of her arms and scratched herself with the other.
Peanuts did the same thing.
Then she held out her hand.
Uncertain about what to do next, Peanuts reached out and touched Fossey gently with his huge black hand.
Then he turned away and ran toward the other gorillas, beating his chest.
Fossey just sat there with tears of joy in her eyes.
As a child, Fossey was attached to animals and dreamed about becoming a veterinarian.
After her graduation from college, she read about a doctor who had studied gorillas in Africa.
The more Fossey read about the gorillas, the more interested she became.
In 1963, her trip to Africa, which was supposed to be a vacation, ended up changing her whole life.
In Tanzania, Fossey met Mary and Louis Leakey, the famous British anthropologists.
The Leakeys believed that by studying gorillas they could acquire more knowledge about humans.
If it had not been for the Leakeys, Fossey would not have been so determined to study gorillas.
At the end of 1966, Fossey had a chance to study with British scientist Jane Goodall at a chimpanzee reserve in Tanzania.
Fossey later set up her own research station in the Virunga National Park in Congo.
This was a very difficult task.
Originally the gorillas screamed and ran away when they saw her.
But Fossey was patient, and the gorillas eventually let her get close enough to sit and watch them as she wrote her observations in a notebook.
Unfortunately, Fossey was facing other threats.
Due to the unstable political situation in that area, it was very dangerous for a woman alone to undertake such research.
Instead of worrying, Fossey enjoyed what she was doing.
One day, the park director, who was suspicious of her activities, sent guards to put her under house arrest, which meant that she wasnt allowed to go anywhere without their permission.
To come up with a way to get away, Fossey said that she had to go to Uganda to register her car.
She succeeded in escaping, obtaining new supplies, and setting up the Karisoke Research Center in the mountains of Rwanda.
For the next thirteen years, Fossey lived and worked with the mountain gorillas.
Fossey gave us a new and unique view of gorillas in the wild.
She discovered that they care for one another and will fight to protect an infant.
In general, she found they were peaceful and gentle creatures.
While conducting a count of the gorillas, Fossey discovered that these creatures were on the verge of extinction, as the inhabitants of Rwanda cut down the forests where the gorillas lived for farming, and poachers hunted the gorillas for their skins and to sell them to zoos.
Fossey felt devastated when some of her favorite gorillas were killed.
By this point, Fossey was becoming weak, and the difficulty of life in the forest was worsening her health.
Feeble as she was, she gathered her energy for a new mission.
Not long, she returned to the United States to get her strength back and finished writing her book Gorillas in the Mist.
Three years after the completion of her book, Fossey went back to Africa.
By this time, however, Fossey had many enemies, including the farmers, the poachers, and the park directors who received bribes from the poachers.
Even the Rwandan government was against her.
On December 27, 1985, Fossey wasfound murdered in her cabin.
She was buried at the Karisoke Research Station next to the gorillas who had been killed in that area.
On her grave are the words The Lady Who Lives Alone in the Forest. Sadly, her mission to rescue the gorillas was never accomplished.
They are still in great danger today.
