AUNT ICE, AUNT SNOW
--In Memory of Two Beauties in the Water Family--
Aunt Ice, please cry no more
Or the seas will spill all over,
And homeless will be the polar bear,
And harbors will be flooded,
And islands will go under.
Cry no more please, Aunt Ice.
We blamed you for being so cold,
Fit to behold, but not to hold.
We called you the Icy Beauty,
Mad with self-love on keeping clean,
Too proud ever to become soft.
Yet, when you cry so hard you melt.
Aunt Snow, please hide no more
Or you will truly disappear.
Almost a stranger year after year,
When you do come, you're less familiar,
Thinner and gone again sooner.
Please hide no more, Aunt Snow.
You were beloved as the fairest:
With such grace you used to descend,
Even more lightly than Aunt Rain.
Such pure white ballerina shoes
Drift in a whirl out of heaven
Like a nursery song, a dream.
Cry no more please, Aunt Ice.
Lock up your rich treasury,
Shut tight your translucent tower,
And guard your palaces at the poles
To keep the world cool and fresh.
Cry no more please, Aunt Ice.
Hide no more please, Aunt Snow.
"Light Snow is followed by Heavy Snow."
Descend in avalanche, Aunt Snow!
Your show the lunar Pageant waits.
Come and kiss my upturned face.
Hide no more please, Aunt Snow.
