You may have heard of or been to rotating observatories situated at the topmost level of high-rise buildings where you can enjoy a 3-degree panoramic view.
But have you ever imagined a building with rotating floors from top to bottom?
Living on any level of the building, you could indulge in breakfast while enjoying the astonishing mountain view and have dinner while admiring the vast ocean.
You would no longer have to wake up each day to the exact same view outside your apartment window.
This fantasy may be transformed into reality by the proposed Dynamic Tower, the world's first "building in motion."
A brainchild of the Italian architect David Fisher, this rotating tower will be built in Dubai, a city-state of the United Arab Emirates that boasts many ambitious projects.
As is expected, Fisher's progressive design concept will attract attention from all over the world.
It is, after all, a totally new and original idea.
Magnificent buildings around the world have made everlasting impressions on people with their strikingly original shapes and styles.
However, now even the traditional concept of the "static" building is being dramatically challenged.
The Dynamic Tower is unique in that it is, in Fisher's words, "designed by life, shaped by time."
That is to say, unlike any buildings we have ever known, it will continually change its shape as time passes.
Seen from the exterior, the building will transform into a series of artistic forms as it rotates.
At some moments it may resemble a twisted strand of DNA; at other times it may look like a ballerina doing a pirouette in slow motion.
The possibilities are endless.
Since each floor of the building will act as an individual component and thus be capable of rotating independently, your upstairs and downstairs neighbors may see different views from the one you see.
While most floors will revolve at a pace controlled by a central computer system, people who can afford villas on the top floors will have the extra luxury of rotating their apartments at will with a voice-activated control device.
Moreover, a drive-in elevator will take all the residents and their cars to their own floors so they can park right outside their high-rise apartments.
On top of its novel design, this futuristic edifice will also be innovative in the way it is built and powered.
It will be the world's first completely prefabricated high-rise building.
The floors will hang like rings around an immobile cement core.
Except for the central core that will be built on site, all the floors will be prefabricated in a factory and then shipped to the site to be attached to the core.
The construction process will start from the top floor and each level will be connected to the core until the ground floor is completed.
Time-consuming and labor-intensive as this process may seem, a mere 8 workers will be able to finish one story in just a week, which is many times faster than the time required for a conventional building.
What's more, the revolution of each floor will be powered by electricity generated by solar panels and gigantic wind turbines positioned between each floor.
The building will thus be entirely self-sufficient, and might even generate excess energy that can be sold to neighboring facilities.
Therefore, in addition to its revolutionary design, the Dynamic Tower will also be a "green" building.
Recognized by TIME magazine as one of the "Best Inventions of the Year" in 2, the Dynamic Tower, according to Fisher, "will radically change not only the concept of design but also that of construction and real estate, bringing a new dimension to architecture and to our way of living."
If the project in Dubai goes smoothly, there will be more revolving towers to come in metropolitan areas around the world.
