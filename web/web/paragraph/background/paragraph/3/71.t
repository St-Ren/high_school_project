In the pitch blackness before dawn, four boats leave a port in southwest Spain to start a complex trapin the ocean.
About 50 fishermen drop hundreds of red markers, attached to nets, forming rows as neat as traffic lanes on a highway.
Then they move their boats to form a wide square, and they wait.
As the sun rises an hour later, a drama begins.
Nearly 200 huge tuna swim through the lanes until they find themselves trapped in a net that the fishermen have connected between their boats.
The tuna toss about wildly in desperate search of escape, but the captains have already formed their boats into a far tighter square, closing all exits.
One by one, the exhausted fish die.
The fishermen cry out in delight.
"This is our best day this year," says one.
But the joy of the fishermen may not last.
Their life has become far more uncertain in the
Mediterranean area since they have to struggle to
compete against international companies.

 Nowadays, much of the Mediterranean's tuna is no longer caught by traditional means.
High-tech "tuna ranches"-fish farms made of circular floating cages about 50 meters in diameter and 50 meters deep, set up 2-3 km from shorebegan appearing in the Mediterranean in the late 90s.
The ranches are most often controlled not by small European operators but by large multinational corporations.
In the cages, tuna get fat on smaller fish, often for months at a time, before they are slaughtered and shipped off to Japanthe market for nearly 80% of the Mediterranean bluefin catch.
To fight the tuna ranches, the traditional fishermen need to stop the fish long before they reach the Mediterranean's open water.
Their contest against the industrial ranches has become so fierce during the past few years that some marine biologists and environmental activists fear the Mediterranean bluefin might not survive.
The amount of tuna caught in the Mediterranean has soared in just a few years.
Indeed, it tripled between the summer of 2002 and late in 2006, according to a report.
The World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF)10 is sure that people are fishing the Mediterranean's stock into extinction .
With fish, too much harvesting can drive down prices until suddenly there are no more.
"It's like in a war," says a researcher for the WWF.
"You can kill a million people the first year, 2 million the next year, 20 million people the year after that.
Eventually you will end the war because there will be no more people to be killed."
Environmentalists urge that the rules on tuna fishing be tightened.
Some environmental groups and the U.S. will be trying to crack down on overfishing.
Overfishing threatens not only fish stocks in the Mediterranean but traditional fishing communities as well.
Hundreds of thousands of people around the Mediterranean make their living from the sea, and the European Union (E.U.
)12 officials believe a sudden lack of fish would affect many towns and villages.
At the same time, the E.U.
is trying to save fish by trying to convince fishermen to change their profession.
funds currently help fishermen retire at 55 and pay to train them for new jobs in tourism.
Currently, in many small towns, there is a sense of a way of life passing awayoften replaced by an easier, more profitable modern life.
In many fishing towns, old men fish; their sons do not.
"There are other choices now," says a fisherman.
For fishermen, perhaps.
But for the tuna?
