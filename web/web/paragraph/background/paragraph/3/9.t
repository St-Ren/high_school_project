Robert Frost and His Poems.
Robert Frost (1874-1963) is probably the best-known American poet of the twentieth century.
He won almost every major literary award and honor, received numerous honorary degrees, and was invited to teach at many top universities.
He was offered the
Congressional Gold Medal in 1960 and invited to read his poems at President Kennedys
inauguration.
For nearly half a century he was the unofficial poet laureate of America, and his poems have been widely read around the world.
Frosts interest and talent in poetry can be traced back to his boyhood.
As the son of an elementary school teacher, he used to sit in his mothers classroom and memorize long passages of prose and poetry, and thus grew to love language and literature.
He published his first poem in 1894, but it was not until his stay in England from 1912 to 1915 that he gained public recognition as a poet.
After returning from England, he lived most of the rest of his life in rural New England.
The walks that he took on his farm allowed him to observe the details of nature and the rural landscape: the flowers and leaves, the streams and brooks, the changing seasons.
Such images, described in simple and direct language, became a hallmark of his poetry.
The rural environment that Frost knew and loved also included a strong human presence.
In fact, it is his awareness of mans relationship with nature that brings us some of Frosts most memorable imagesXimages that not only move us with their serene beauty, but also inspire us by addressing universal questions of life.
In The Road Not Taken, for example, the poet presents a traveler walking through the autumn woods who comes to a fork in the road; his decision about which way to go becomes a metaphor for the major turning points that a person confronts in life.
In another poem, Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, a
rider on horseback contemplates whether he should stop and enjoy the beautiful winter scenery or continue home, his dilemma reflecting the universal struggle between freedom and duty.
To his regret, the rider realizes that before he can enjoy his freedom, he must fulfill his responsibilities.
As we can see, common human experiences, with Frosts unique touch, are elevated to a level of profound meaning.
To this day, his poems continue to touch the hearts of readers everywhere.

The Road Not Taken
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that, the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and IX
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sounds the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
Xby Robert Frost, from The Poetry of Robert Frost
