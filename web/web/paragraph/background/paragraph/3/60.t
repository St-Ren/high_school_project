In Williams Words.
The name William Shakespeare is one of the most recognized and revered names in history.
Widely known as a literary genius, the famed playwright and poet has earned such nicknames as the Bard and Englands national poet.
His plays have been translated into every major language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.
Even today his creative achievements have yet to be surpassed.
Still, in spite of his fame, very little is known about the man himself.
It is believed that William Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford-on-Avon.
As a boy, he likely attended grammar school and studied subjects like Greek and Latin
literature.
However, for reasons unknown, Shakespeare left school when he was fifteen and never again pursued a formal education.
Just three years later, in 1582, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior.
Soon afterwards, they started a family.
No one really knows how or when Shakespeare first began writing and acting, but by the mid-1580s his interest in these areas had gained momentum.
As a result, he left Stratford-on-Avon and moved to London to pursue his dreams.
Theater was the primary source of entertainment during the Elizabethan Era, and Queen Elizabeth herself was likely one of the theaters biggest patrons.
It is no surprise that a superbly talented writer like Shakespeare flourished in this world.
Aside from being a playwright, Shakespeare was also a well-known actor.
And since the actors of the day were jacks-of-all-trades, it can be assumed that Shakespeare was also skilled in dancing, singing, doing acrobatics, and playing musical instruments.
He rose to fame when he joined the Lord Chamberlains Men, an acting company protected by the queen herself.
It wasnt just Shakespeares acting that impressed the queen.
He made quite a name for himself as a prolific writer, even during his day.
His plays were often purchased and performed for large audiences in places such as the famous Globe Theatre, of which Shakespeare was part owner.
Records show that the Lord Chamberlains Men performed at least two of Shakespeares plays before Queen Elizabeth and her court, further affirming Shakespeares fame and talent.
Even as the plague shut down theaters all over London in the 1590s, Shakespeare continued to pen plays and poetry that would eventually make history.
Credited with authoring an impressive 37 plays and 154 sonnets, Shakespeare is widely remembered for his creative achievements.
However, his works are not without controversy.
Some people doubt that he wrote all of the works that are credited to him and propose other people as the true authors.
Theories abound that support more educated individuals as the likely writers.
Most people disagree with these claims, however, instead giving Shakespeare credit where credit is due.
Shakespeares plays were written in a poetic style known as blank verse.
Basically, this is poetry that doesnt rhyme but is still pleasing to the ear because, being mainly in iambic pentameter, it imitates the rhythms of natural speech.
Blank verse is very flexible, allowing poets and playwrights to express themselves freely.
Shakespeares plays fall into three categories: comedies, histories, and tragedies.
Among his most famous are Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, A Midsummer Nights Dream, and Antony and Cleopatra.
Shakespeares genius really shows when it comes to his vocabulary.
Some experts consider it a reliable estimate that he knew over 29,000 words, which would already make him virtually a genius.
And when he couldnt come up with an appropriate word in his writing, he invented a new one.
In fact, Shakespeare coined over 1,700 words that are commonly used today in the English language, and popularized others that were already in use.
Among the words credited to him are amazement, assassination, downstairs, employer, fashionable, silliness, and useful. The idioms and expressions he invented include break the ice, come what may, love is blind, and alls well that ends well. His plays have returned again and again to the stage and, beginning in the twentieth century, also to the screen, and so his genius continues to live on through his words.
