The Magic Source of Strength in Sports.
Did you know that some lawyers wear the same suit throughout the course of a trial in order to win a court case?
Have you ever visited the local Wenchang Temple for good luck on the test youre about to take?
It seems that to ensure victory, some people resort to supernatural methods, and those from different walks of life may develop certain eccentric rituals.
Given the increasingly high salaries and more and more intense competition in the world of professional sports, it should come as no surprise that professional athletes are turning to superstitious rituals more than ever before.
In fact, superstitions prevail in the world of sports.
Imagine a baseball player talking to his bat or even sleeping with it.
Weird as it may sound, some Major League Baseball (MLB) players believe in this kind of magic.
Some are also convinced that spitting on their hands before picking up the bat will enable them to get a hit.
When running off the field at the end of an inning, some players make a point of stepping on one of the bases or are cautious not to touch the baselines so that they wont have bad luck.
Certain National Basketball Association (NBA) players have made it a ritual to wipe the soles of their sneakers before every game.
The player who happens to be the last to shoot a basket during the warm-up may take it as a sign that he will be the luckiest player in the game.
In fact, players seemingly habitual practice of dribbling before a foul shot was originally a superstitious ritual to bring good luck.
As for American football players, they wont take a new number when they transfer to another team.
Also, many football teams have a tradition of touching something like a statue before taking the field.
In the golf world, coins play an important role: golfers use them to mark the position of their ball.
Since all golfers hope to shoot a 65 or 66, dimes from the mid-1960s are popular.
Also, some golfers will start a game using only an odd-numbered club.
It seems that the heavier the burden an athlete must bear, the more likely he or she is to develop some irrational rituals.
Take, for example, Yani TsengXthe Taiwanese golfer who now ranks number one in the world.
She requested that her fans support her by wearing pink, her lucky color.
She also makes it a habit to have fried rice with chicken and cucumber when she is about to play a round of golf.
Michael Jordan, one of the most prominent basketball players of all time, derived some of his confidence from the shorts he had worn while at North Carolina University; he always wore the lucky shorts under his Bulls uniform.
In another example, the Spanish soccer star Raul was once scolded for wearing a yellow T-shirt during a training session just because his coach, Luis Aragones, thought yellow would bring bad luck.
But perhaps the best-known case of a superstitious athlete is that of Wade Boggs, a player for the Boston Red Sox and Baseball Hall of Famer.
Boggs would eat only poultry before every game.
He also had a time fixation: he always entered the batting cage at exactly 5:17
p.m. and ran wind sprints at 7:17 p.m.
Of course, it is athletes competence, along with physical fitness and their desire to defeat their opponents, that actually enables them to win games, including championship ones.
At least, this is the normal, rational explanation.
The problem is that in hyper-competitive games played by world-class athletes, it is always very possible that a game will be lost by just one crucial point or run or goal.
It is probably a mere matter of good or bad luck in the eyes of those who have just won or lost.
Thus, as Larry King once said, Those who have succeeded at anything and dont mention luck are kidding themselves. So, when you stop to think about success in sports, you realize that there may be two sides to this coin after all.
