Lincolns High Hopes for His Son.
Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809VApril 15, 1865), the sixteenth president of the United States, was born into an unremarkable family.
Since his childhood, he had been exposed to anti-slavery sentiment at the slave auctions he used to witness.
In his political career, Lincoln was fully devoted to emancipating slaves, and as president he supported the antislavery, pro-Union North in the American Civil War (1861V).
As the Federal Army moved toward victory in a war that caused many deaths and casualties on both sides, Lincoln finally realized his dream of abolishing slavery.
His strong belief in democracy and equality is clear in his famous Gettysburg Address, in which he stated that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. In 1865, Lincolns assassination shocked the whole nation, yet never will his dedication to preserving the unity of the United States be forgotten.
Lincoln, an honorable statesman, also played the role of an ordinary father.
He wrote a letter to his sons teacher in the hope of shaping his son into a man of decency, compassion, and persistence, characteristics valued by Lincoln.
In this letter we can see a fathers great expectations for his child, and at the same time appreciate Lincolns powerful rhetoric.
The following is the letter.
He will have to learn, I know, that all men are not just, all men are not true.
But teach him also that for every scoundre there is a hero; that for every selfish politician, there is a dedicated leader ...Teach him for every enemy there is a friend.
Steer him away from envy, if you can, teach him the secret of quiet laughter.
Let him learn early that the bullies are the easiest to lick ...
Teach him, if you can, the wonder of books ...
But also give him quiet time to ponder
the eternal mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun, and the flowers on a green hillside.
In the school teach him it is far more honorable to fail than to cheat ...
Teach him to have faith in his own ideas, even if everyone tells him they are wrong ...
Teach him to be gentle with gentle people, and tough with the tough.
Try to give my son the strength not to follow the crowd
when everyone is getting on the bandwagon.
Teach him to listen to all men ...
but teach him also to filter all he hears on a screen of truth,
and take only the good that comes through.
Teach him if you can, how to laugh when he is sad ...
Teach him there is no shame in tears,
Teach him to scoff at cynics and to beware of too much sweetness ...
Teach him to sell his brawn and brain to the highest bidders but never to put a price tag on his heart and soul.
Teach him to close his ears to a howling mob and to stand and fight if he thinks hes right.
Treat him gently, but do not cuddle him, because only the test of fire makes final steel.
Let him have the courage to be impatient ... let him have the patience to be brave.
Teach him always to have sublime faith in himself, because then he will have sublime faith in mankind.
This is a big order, but see what you can do ...
He is such a fine fellow, my son!
