Bottled mineral water has become the lifestyle accessory of the
health-conscious and just the plain thirsty.
No longer a luxury item, the beverage has become a common sight worldwide.
But according to campaigners, the planet's health and people's health may be suffering as a result.
To begin with, the basic assumption that bottled water is safer for humans, is being questioned.
There is mounting evidence against bottled water.
The Natural Resources Defense Council of America, which carried out a four-year review of the bottled water industry, concluded "there is no assurance that just because water comes out of a bottle, it is any cleaner or safer than water from the tap."
Another New York City-based action group added that an estimated 25 percent of bottled water is "really just tap water in a bottlesometimes further treated, sometimes not."
In Britain, Nick Reeves, the executive director of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, said the perception that bottled water is purer than tap water is unfounded.
"For example," he said, "the high mineral content of some bottled water makes them unsuitable for feeding babies and young children."
Additionally, most bottled water doesn't contain added fluoride, which can make teeth stronger.
Kids are drinking more bottled water and less fluoridated tap water, and some say that's behind the recent rise in dental decay
 Storing is another problem.
Placed near a heat source, the plastic bottles can release toxic chemicals into the water.
But that's not the only potential risk; so are the other things kept nearby.
Experts advise against storing water in the garage, near gas fumespesticides and other chemicals that could, at the very least, affect the smell and taste of the HO.
At worst, they could penetratehe bottle and contaminatehe water.
Water from a tap doesn't carry these risks.
And then there is the effect of millions of plastic bottles on the planet.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)8, some 2.7 million tons (2.4 million metric tons) of plastic are used to bottle water each year worldwide.
The plastic most commonly used is derived from crude oil.
It can take between 400 and 1,000 years to degrade.
In terms of energy use, plastic bottles are also very costly.
One report estimated that if water and soft drink bottlers had used 10 percent recycledmaterials in their plastic bottles in 2004, they would have saved the equivalent of 72 million gallons of gasoline.
If they had used 25 percent, they would have saved enough energy to provide electricity to more than 680,000 homes for a year.
In fact, bottled water can be 10,000 times more expensive, said Emily Arnold, a researcher with a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group, Earth Policy Institute (EPI)12.
"Bottled water costs more than gasoline," she said.
Most of this extra cost is driven by transportationand packaging
So, if you are worried about the toll of your bottled water habit on yourself or the Earth, you can take the following steps.
Drink from your tap.
Unless your government warns against this, it should be fine.
Get a canteen.
Carry your tap water in a reusable stainless steel, or a lined, drinking container, and clean it between uses.
Keep it cool.
Don't drink from a bottle that has been subjected to high temperatures (sitting in your car, for example), don't store it anywhere it will be exposed to heat or chemicals, and don't reuse plastic bottles.
Go with glass.
Choose glass containers over plastic whenever possible.
When you're done, recycle
