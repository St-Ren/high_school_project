Mysteries of the Past.
Human beings have made many discoveries and have accomplished many things.
We have explored the surface of the moon.
We have learned to split atoms.
We have figured out how to create computers.
With the vast knowledge of modern science, it seems there is nothing, or very little, that we do not know or will not know eventually.
Nevertheless, there are still things in the world that we cannot explain.
Some of these are objects that we can see clearlyXin fact, some of them are hugeXand are standing right before us.
They are objects that were even made by human beingsXand yet, we cannot fully understand how or why they were created.
They are the mysteries of the past.
The Pyramids: The great pyramids of Egypt, which reached their highest development around 2500 B.C., are perhaps the most famous of the worlds ancient mysteries.
It is estimated that the largest of the pyramids took twenty years to build and involved the labor of a hundred thousand workers moving 2.6 million blocks of stone into place.
How these massive blocks of stone were lifted and moved without the use of modern technology is a question that has never been fully answered, although many theories have been suggested.
They may have been placed on wooden rollers or on brick ramps.
Even more amazing, though, is that such an ancient  society would have had the technical ability to design these magnificent structures, which include many inner rooms and tunnels, and that they would have been able to organize so many workers to complete such a task.
Stonehenge: This unusual circular arrangement of stone columns in southern Britain dates back to 3000 B.C.
Although many of the original stones are no longer standing, those that are measure up to five meters in height and are topped with lintels, or horizontally placed stones that create a sort of roof around the circle.
Most scholars today believe that Stonehenge was designed by ancient tribes as an astronomical calendar, used to predict lunar and solar eclipses.
Some also say the site may have been a temple.
No one, however, knows for sure.
Moreover, it remains a mystery just how these huge stones were brought to the site and placed in such a specific circular arrangement.
As with the pyramids, it would have taken many workers and many daysXor rather yearsX to accomplish.
What could make it so important to these ancient people to make such an effort?
And why would they have such an interest in eclipses?
Because of its mysterious origins, the site has been associated with many legends, perhaps most famously with the stories of King Arthur.
According to one legend, the stones were magically flown into place by Merlin, the famous wizard of Arthurian legend.
Easter Island: When European explorers arrived at this remote Pacific island in 1722, they discovered its coast was lined with hundreds of godlike statues carved from volcanic rock, each of them facing inland, away from the sea.
Each statue wears a crown and has very long ears.
All of them are nearly identical, except that some are taller than others, with the tallest being two stories in height 20 and weighing several tons.
Once again, it is difficult for us to imagine how people with only primitive technology would have been able to move these huge rocks from the area where they were quarried.
Their meaning is also a mystery.
They might appear to be guarding the island, except they are looking inward, not outward.
Some archeologists believe they may have represented the tribes ancestors, but beyond this, their purpose is unknown.
Their age is also uncertain, but they are estimated to date back to around A.D. 300.
According to legend, the tribe that built the statues was wiped out in a vicious battle with another tribe sometime during the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century.
The Nasca Lines: This huge arrangement of lines and drawings was carved into the desert near the Andes Mountains in Peru beginning around 500 B.C.
and took one thousand years to complete.
Covering more than five hundred square kilometers, it has been called the biggest drawing ever created.
Overlying the drawings of birds, animals, insects and flowers is a complex  network of intersecting lines, some of which are hundreds of miles long and extend across the desert plains and up into the mountains.
One of the greatest wonders about the Nasca Lines is that they show the Nascan people had highly developed surveying skills.
Even the longest of the lines are perfectly straight, although they can be viewed in whole only from the air.
It is possible, scientists believe, that the ancient Nascan people may have invented the earliest hot air balloons, which they could have used to survey the land and plan the drawings.
Why they would have created these drawings is another mystery.
Like most other ancient structures, they are believed to have had some religious or ritualistic function, perhaps meant as a means of communicating with the gods.
The above are just a few of the many mysterious creations of ancient humans.
Others exist all over the world.
Taken together, these mysteries point to yet another mystery: For whatever purpose, just how did human beings first get the inspiration to build and to create such structures?
Just where does this impulse come from?
Here also is another question to consider: Will the statues and buildings we erect today also become a source of mystery for future Humans?
