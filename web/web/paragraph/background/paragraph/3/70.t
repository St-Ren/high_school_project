On a quiet October night in 1957, the residents of Coalwood gathered in a field staring at the measureless universe.
They were tracing a small spot of light moving across the night sky.
It was the first satellite , Sputnik, launched by the Russians.
When the light scratched the dark sky, it sowed a seed for a dream in a boy's mind.
Located in West Virginia, Coalwood, as the name suggests, was a coal town.
In the 1950s, all the boys in Coalwood seemed to be destined to work in the mine.
The only way to escape from the gray town was to enter college with a football scholarship.
However, Homer Hickam was neither strong nor tough enough to be a football player.
He was doomed to lead his life in the underground world.
Everything changed when Homer saw Sputnik crossing the sky.
So inspired by the experience, he became determined to build a rocket himself.
He enthusiastically shared his thoughts with his family, but laughter was
the only response he got.
 Homer started to look up information in the library, but soon he realized it was too difficult for him to accomplish the task alone.
So, he convinced three friends to work on the project with him.
In a short time, they finished the first model, but it only exploded.
In each experiment, they made many mistakes, but fortunately, they got help from many people in the town.
With their help,  product was no longer merely an explosive.
However, even though it started to take off, it wouldn't fly straight.
Around this time, Homer's father was hurt in a mine accident.
To support the family, Homer was forced to drop out of school and work in the mine.
The plan to build a rocket was terminated, and so was Homer's dream.
 Even in the hardest times, Mrs. Riley, Homer's science teacher, did not give up on Homer.
She continued to encourage him to pursue his dream.
Eventually, Homer knew it was time to leave the mine, go back to school, and fulfill his dream.
 Homer's father was disappointed with Homer's decision.
He thought Homer had inherited his talent and would
be a great miner.
They had a fierce argument, and
Homer's father knew his son was going to leave
him eventually, like the rocket flying high into
Homer's rocket design improved a lot, and he showed it at the National Science Fair.
The judges were impressed with his work and Homer won first place.
Homer could not believe that his dream was coming true.
With excitement Homer went back to Coalwood, and before leaving home for college, he prepared a special rocket launch to thank those who had helped him.
He invited his father, saying, "I've come to believe that I've got it in me to be somebody in this world.
It's not because I'm different from you.
It's because I'm the same as you."
But, Homer wasn't sure if his father would come for the launch.
In the end, however, Homer's father showed up and even pushed the launch button.
As the rocket went high up into the sky, he proudly put his arm around Homer's shoulder, knowing his son was aiming as high.
