A symbol, simply put, is something that stands for something else.
Usually, it is a material object used to represent something that is more abstract.
If you look closely at the world around you, you will soon realize that symbols can be found almost everywhere.
Traffic signs, banknotes, or wedding rings are all common examples.
Take a wedding ring for example.
When used in a ceremony, this tiny piece of metal is no longer a decorative accessory but a symbol that signifies not only a lifelong and everlasting commitment but also unending love in marriage, as its circular shape may suggest.
But when it comes to poetry, how do symbols work?
A poem is a literary work where the most symbols are found in the shortest space.
A symbol, as John Drury, a contemporary American poet, once defined it, is "an image that radiates meanings."
When an image or event is read as a symbol, it is given another layer of meaning beyond its literal one.
What follows is a short poem by Robert Frost, "Fire and Ice."
Before going on to its analysis, read it through and see if you can identify any images that serve as symbols.
Fire and Ice
Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice.
-Robert Frost--
What pictures come to mind when you run through the first two lines?
Perhaps you see a dark image of the earth burning down to ashes, and then a globe frozen into ice.
If you move on, you will see that the images of fire and ice refer to something more than just flaring flames or chilly ice.
Paired with desire, the image of fire becomes symbolic of the burning greed that drives one to his or her destruction.
On the other hand, linked with hate, the image of ice symbolizes the enmity that leads people to fight deadly wars, or just keeps each of them isolated in a numb state of existence, like a frozen world where nothing grows.
Through these associated meanings, the two simple images are no longer inanimate natural phenomena but symbols of the destructive force of human emotions.
Symbols adding greater complexity to poetry, our reading experience of poems is thus enriched and poems can be interpreted differently.
No symbols have absolute meanings; their sense can be determined by each reader's culture and time.
But it is also vital to make sure your understanding of the symbol is relevant to the whole context of the poem.
Examine the two poems below, which explore the significance of a seemingly trivial incident in the speaker's life.
While reading, think about what the central event is in each poem and what it might symbolize.
To a Daughter Leaving Home
When I taught you
at eight to ride
a bicycle, loping along
beside you
as you wobbled away
on two round wheels,
my own mouth rounding
in surprise when you pulled
ahead down the curved
path of the park,
I kept waiting
for the thud
of your crash as I
sprinted to catch up,
while you grew
smaller, more breakable
with distance,
pumping, pumping
for your life, screaming
with laughter,
the hair flapping
behind you like a handkerchief waving

The Road Not Taken
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that, the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
two roads diverged in a wood, and I-
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
-Robert Frost (-)-
