In more than 20 years as an allergy and asthma expert, Dr. Paul Ehrlich had never seen a case quite like this one.
The patient, a woman in her late twenties, would break out in hives at the same time every nightwright after her husband arrived home from work.
I think Im allergic to him! she shouted.
Ehrlich knew that was impossible; people are not allergic to other people.
But what was she reacting to?
Her husbands cologne?
A substance he was exposed to at work and was transporting home on his clothes?
Since the patient didnt have a problem before her husband left in the morning, she obviously wasnt allergic to his aftershave.
And since she didnt break out when she dropped by his office, her hives probably werent directly related to his job, Ehrlich reasoned.
On the other hand, they almost certainly had something to do with her husbands weekday activities because the outbreaks didnt happen on weekends.
The mystery was finally solved when Ehrlich asked the patient what her husband ate for lunch.
The answer: peanut butterwa substance to which, tests later proved, his wife was intensely allergic.
He would come home, kiss her hellowand still have enough of the peanut butter in his system to cause her to break out, Ehrlich recalls.
Once he stopped eating it, the problem was solved.
Welcome to the world of one of New York Citys top allergy and asthma experts.
This is a man who has to be both a scientist and a detective as he sorts through the virtually endless list of substances to which patients can be allergic: bugs, pollen, animals, milk, wine, and shrimp, to name just a few.
Allergies are no joking matter to the estimated 50 million Americans who have them.
Even mild allergic reactions can lead to a series of misery-inducing symptoms: runny nose, coughing, sneezing, watery eyes, itching, rashes, hives, stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache.
And more severe reactions can be disabling, even life-threatening: asthma affects 17 million Americans and kills 5,400 every year, while another 150 die of allergy-related shock, a sudden, severe, system-wide reaction to an allergen such as a food, drug, or insect bite.
What causes allergic reactions?
Strangely enough, the culprit is the immune system.
In most cases, it helps the body fight off dangerous invaders such as viruses.
But in the case of allergies, the system incorrectly considers a harmless substance, like pollen or a peanut, to be threatening.
To defend against it, the body releases a chemical that causes those all-too-familiar allergic symptoms.
The symptoms vary, depending on what part of the body the reaction takes place in and how much allergen is involved.
It doesnt have to be much: Even 1/44,000 of a peanut can cause a reaction in someone who is extremely allergic to the nuts.
Although doctors dont know why some people develop allergies while others dont, they do know that genes play an important role.
If one of your parents has allergies, you have an increased risk of developing them, too.
If both parents have them (even if they are allergic to different substances), your chances skyrocket.
And if you have allergies, you are at significantly higher risk of developing asthma.
In addition, allergies and asthma can strike at any age.
To date, there is no cure for asthma or allergies.
However, there are some ways to minimize allergic reactions such as taking medication to control the symptoms, receiving injections of the allergen to build up the bodys tolerance, or avoiding the allergen altogether.
Ehrlich recalls another case.
An Army colonel whose son was allergic to the family dog came to him for help.
When Ehrlich told the family that the dog had to go, the colonel was horrified.
Isnt there something else we can do he asked.
Jokingly, Ehrlich suggested sending the son away.
Everyone laughed, but several months later, it turned out that theyd kept the dog and sent the boy off to a boarding school.
Ehrlich shakes his head in disbelief.
I even have veterinarian patients who are allergic to cats and dogs, he says.
Its great for me, terrible for them.
I could make a living just by treating people who love animals.
