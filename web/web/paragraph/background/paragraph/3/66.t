Yellowstone Wolves Make a Comeback.
The American Northwests grey wolf population had already been decreasing for many years when, in 1872, chunks of three northwestern states were joined to form Yellowstone National Park, which comprises a territory of almost nine thousand square kilometers.
However, the founding of the national park hardly let the poor wolves off the hook.
In the beginning, people were still as free as ever to shoot any wild animals they came across, and grey wolves remained a popular target since they were often considered hazardous to livestock and humans.
By 1926, Yellowstones grey wolves had been wiped out.
In the following decades, however, it became clear that the ecological balance of the region had been disrupted by the loss of this species.
The wolves had preyed upon elk and other large plant-eating animals; without the wolves, these animals rapidly increased in number.
Elk have a weird habit of gnawing the bark of young trees near rivers, leaving the riverside with fewer and fewer trees.
Beavers depend on trees for food and for building dams, which help to create streams, ponds, and lakes, weaving an intricate web of life for bugs, fish, birds, and plants.
So, with elk gnawing away too many trees, the beavers started to die out, the land began to dry up, and an ecosystem came apart at the seams.
Because of this, biologists and environmentalists began to call for the return of the grey wolf, and the campaign to reintroduce the grey wolf to Yellowstone Park began in earnest in the 1940s.
It became legal with the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
In March 1995, fourteen grey wolves captured in Canada were released into the park, after spending several weeks adapting to this somewhat more civilized life by living in specially constructed pens.
Another seventeen wolves were brought in the following year, and ever since then, the grey wolves have reestablished themselves in Yellowstone.
But do the wolves persist in their old bad habit of eating livestock?
Of course they do, because you cant teach an old wolf new tricks.
With Yellowstones increasing wolf population, there have been hundreds of reports of livestock killings.
Despite a compensation fund set up to reimburse those who lose their livestock to wolves, the ranchers and farmers continue to argue against the presence of wolves.
Many wish that their meek, innocent sheep could live in peace rather than in constant fear of the wolves.
Nevertheless, the truth is that most of the Yellowstone wolves pay no attention to livestock, except for a few rogue wolf packs.
Like gangs with a howl, these are the villains that need to be hunted down or relocated.
The good news is that the wolves have been doing what people were counting on them to do.
The Yellowstone elk population has shrunk by over 50 percent.
The riverbanks have become lively with lush trees, which are filled to the brim with happily chirping birds.
The beavers can put their teeth back into action biting the wood and building dams, which means more wetland habitats for other species.
Water keeps the land green and is essential to every form of life.
Bears, wolverines, eagles, and ravens all thrive on the wolves leftovers as well as the remains of dead wolves.
Little did biologists realize that the entire forest would benefit from the reintroduction of the grey wolf, down to the soil on the forest floor.
Whats intriguing is that the wolves, which often appear to be villains, have turned out to be the indispensable heroes of this ecological play.
They do not eliminate any animal populations, but rather keep some of them in check, which actually promotes the survival of many more species.
If there were no wolves, the ecological balance of the park would definitely be upset.
Yellowstones wolf population is now estimated at only two to three hundred, yet stubborn ranchers and farmers are still fuming about the wolves and want to make wolf hunting, even in the park, legal once again.
However, we must support these seemingly fierce but actually vulnerable animals, so that for many years to come, we can go out on a peaceful night in Yellowstone and hear a chorus of animal sounds, including the grey wolves howling at the moon.
