When you hear about plastic surgery, what do you think of?
A Hollywood star trying to delay the effects of aging?
People who want to change the size of their stomachs?
But what about the four-year-old boy who has his chin rebuilt after a dog bite?
The word plastic is taken from a Greek word, which means to form or mold.
However, it doesnt mean that patients who have this type of surgery end up with a face full of fake stuff.
Plastic surgery can be divided into reconstructive procedures and cosmetic ones.
Reconstructive procedures correct defects on the face or body.
These include physical birth defects like cleft lips, injuries like those from dog bites or burns, or the consequences of disease treatments like rebuilding a womans breast after surgery for breast cancer.
Cosmetic procedures alter a part of the body that the person is not satisfied with.
Common cosmetic procedures include making breasts larger or smaller, reshaping the nose, and removing pockets of fat from specific spots on the body.
Although we dont normally think of young people as candidates for cosmetic surgery, the number of teens who choose to get plastic surgery is on the rise.
Teens who have cosmetic procedures, such as those that can help smooth or cover severe acne scars, sometimes feel more comfortable with their appearances after the procedure.
Reconstructive surgery helps teens repair significant defects or problems, but what about having cosmetic surgery just to change their appearances?
As with everything, there are right and wrong reasons to have surgery.
Cosmetic surgery is unlikely to change their life.
Most licensed and respected plastic surgeons spend a lot of time interviewing teens who want plastic surgery to decide whether or not they are good candidates for the surgery.
Doctors want to make sure that teens are emotionally mature enough to handle the surgery and that they are doing it for the right reasons.
Some doctors wont perform certain procedures on a teenager until they are sure that the person is old enough and has finished growing.
Girls who want to enlarge their breasts for cosmetic reasons usually must be at least 18 because such surgery is only approved for women 18 and older.
Almost all teens are self-conscious about their bodies.
Some wish there were a thing or two that could be changed.
A lot of this self-consciousness goes away with time.
Before getting any plastic surgery, ask yourself if you want it for yourself or to please someone else.
Appropriate weight control and exercise can do great things for a persons looks without surgery.
It is never a good idea to choose plastic surgery as a first option.
Some peoples emotions have a really big effect on how they think they look.
People who are depressed,  extremely self-critical, or have an incorrect view of how they really look sometimes think that changing their looks will solve their problems.
In these cases, it wont.
In fact, many doctors wont perform plastic surgery on teens who suffer from depression or other emotional problems until these problems are treated first.
If you are considering plastic surgery, talk it over with your parents.
If you are serious and your parents agree, the next step is meeting with a plastic surgeon to help you learn what to expect before, during, and after the procedurewas well as any possible complications of the surgery.
Procedures and healing times vary, so you will want to do your research into whats involved in your particular procedure.
It is a good idea to choose a doctor who is approved by a professional organization of plastic surgeons.
Plastic surgery is not something to rush into.
If you are thinking about it, find out as much as you can about the specific procedure you are considering and talk it over with doctors and your parents.
Once you have the facts, you can decide whether the surgery is right for you.
