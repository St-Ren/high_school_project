Unit 11  I Have a Dream.
In the past, African-Americans were treated unfairly in the United States.
Even after slavery had been abolished, black people were still segregated from white people in public facilities, transportation, and jobs.
For example, they were restricted to using only the water fountains with signs marked colored. Additionally, they were forbidden to occupy the seats in the first four rows of a bus.
Instead, they had to sit in the rear part of the bus in the colored section.
What if the seats were all occupied?
Black people had no choice but to surrender their seats to white people.
To voice his discontent and show his concern about civil rights, Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his famous speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial.
This speech was entitled I Have a Dream.
Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand, signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
This momentous decree came as a great light of hope to millions of Negro slaves, who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.
It came as joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.
But one hundred years later, the Negro is still not free.
One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.
One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.
One hundred years later, the Negro is still left in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land.
And so weve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
Even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream.
It is a dream deeply rooted in the American Dream.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.
This is our hope.
This is the faith that I go back to the South with.
With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.
With this faith, we will be able to transform the sour notes of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.
With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.
And when this happens, when we allow freedom [to] ringXwhen we let it ring from every village and every community, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of Gods childrenXblack men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and CatholicsXwill be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last!
Free at last!
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!
