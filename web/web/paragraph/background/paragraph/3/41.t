What is the secret of happiness?
The answer may vary from person to person.
Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy in The Alchemist, finds himself searching for a treasure in the Egyptian pyramids in his dream.
He is hesitant about giving up all he has to go on a quest for the treasure he dreams about.
The King of Salem comes up to him and tells him the following story, reminding him that the secret of happiness is to listen to his heart but not to overlook what he already has.
A merchant sent his son to learn the secret of happiness from the wisest of men.
The young man wandered through the desert for forty days until he reached a beautiful castle at the top of a mountain.
There lived the sage for whom the young man was looking.
After the young man entered the castle, he witnessed a great number of activities-merchants coming and going, people chatting in the corners, a small orchestra playing sweet melodies, and a table laden with the most delectable dishes.
Then suddenly the young man saw the white-bearded wise man walking about slowly and talking to each visitor, one at a time.
The old sage looked wonderfully peaceful and relaxed.
The young man did not rush to meet him, but rather waited beside a window for nearly two hours.
When it was finally his turn for consultation, he explained the reason for his visit while the sage listened attentively with great patience.
But when the young man finished, the sage said he did not have the time to explain to him the secret of happiness at that moment.
He suggested that the young man take a stroll around his palace and come back in two hours.
"However, I want to ask a favor of you," he added, handing the boy a teaspoon into which he had poured two drops of oil.
"While you walk, carry this spoon and don't let the oil spill out."
The young man began to climb up and down the palace staircases, always keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon lest the oil should spill out.
At the end of the two hours he returned to the wise man.
"So," asked the sage, "did you see the Persian tapestries hanging in my dining room?
Did you see the marvelous garden, which took my master gardeners ten years to create?
Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library?"
Embarrassed, the young man confessed that he had seen nothing.
His only concern had been not to spill the two drops of oil that the wise man had entrusted to him.
"So, go back and see the wonders of my world," said the sage.
"You can't trust a man if you don't know his house."
Now more at ease, the young man took the spoon and strolled again through the palace, this time paying attention to all the works of art that hung from the ceiling and upon the walls.
He saw the majestic mountains all around the palace, the delicacy of the flowers in the gardens, and the exquisite taste with which each work of art had been placed in its niche.
Returning to the sage, he reported in detail all that he had seen.
"But where are the two drops of oil that I entrusted to you?"
asked the wise man.
Looking down at the spoon, the young man realized that he had spilled the oil.
"Well, this is the only advice I have to give you," said the sage of sages.
"The secret of happiness is to see all the wonders of the world and never forget the two drops of oil in the spoon."
