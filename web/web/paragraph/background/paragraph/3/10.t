Battling the Pirates.
In April 2009, four young Swedish men were each sentenced to a year in jail and were fined the equivalent of more than NT$120 million.
Their crime was piracy.
They had not robbed ships on the high seas, however.
Instead, they owned an Internet company called The Pirate Bay.
Set up in 2003, it has been described as the worlds most high-profile file-sharing website.
Basically, it is a forum where people post links to music, movies, and computer games so that others can download them for free, without having to pay the copyright holders.
This is where the owners of The Pirate Bay fell foul of the law.
Copyright is a form of protection given to the creators of original works, including works of art, literature, drama, music, and other types of intellectual property.
Under the idea of copyright, the creator alone has the right to make and distribute copies of the work and to display or perform it in public.
In general, it is illegal for anyone else to do any of these things without permission from the person who created the work.
While countries have their own laws regarding copyright infringement, there are also international agreements to protect intellectual property rights.
These laws are not always enforced, however.
And the growth of the Internet has complicated the situation.
The Internet has expanded electronic access to music, films, books, and other digital content.
This presents a huge challenge to copyright protection and enforcement, not least because of the Webs lack of borders.
Anyone with a home computer and Internet access can copy and distribute large numbers of digital files.
In recent years, this has been made easier by the appearance of peer-to-peer file-sharing programs.
The effect has been devastating for the music and film industries, as sales of CDs and DVDs have fallen drastically.
Companies that make software or computer games have also suffered.
It is estimated that there are forty million users of illegal software in the United States alone, and many more around the world.
Illegally downloading music and movies is not the only way to break copyright laws.
Perhaps you are a student who would never dream of helping yourself to copyright-protected music or films, but in doing an assignment for school you may have copied and pasted
information you read on a relevant website.
Unless you put these words in quotation marks and credited the source, you were guilty of plagiarism.
Plagiarism means pretending other peoples written work is your own, and it can be a form of copyright violation.
Professional writers who do it will find themselves in trouble with the law.
Most acts of plagiarism, however, are committed by college students who are just being lazy.
The consequences can be serious all the same, as offenders may find themselves failing a class or even being kicked out of school.
Intellectual property infringement is not confined to the Internet, of course.
And it is not confined to creative works.
In fact, there has been a global trade in the copying of brand-name goods such as clothing, watches, and handbags since long before the Information Age began.
This type of copying is called counterfeiting,
and there are also laws to control it.
Still, although everyone understands the illegal nature of counterfeit goods, many people buy and sell them without any sense that what they are doing is wrong.
Copyright infringement, plagiarism, and counterfeiting are things that all of us should be aware of.
After all, if you have worked hard to create something original, wouldnt you rather be rewarded for it than see other people stealing your intellectual property and using it any way they like?
