When Mountains Move.
Growing up in Taiwan, you will be accustomed to hearing news of typhoons and the death and destruction they sometimes bring to the island.
There is evidence that typhoons are increasing in frequency and intensity, possibly due to global warming.
In the future, we might face more events like Typhoon Morakot, which struck Taiwan on August 8, 2009, killing hundreds of people.
Morakot highlighted one of the greatest dangers of a typhoon, namely, the flooding it can bring and, in particular, the possibility of mudslides in mountain areas.
During a heavy storm, rainwater may soak into the ground faster than it can run off.
The pressure of this extra water can cause soil and rocks to become loose.
If a large mass of earth breaks loose, it will slide downhill, picking up more soil and rocks and destroying anything in its path.
This is more likely if the slope is steep, and especially if it is barren.
When deforestation has occurred on a large scale in a mountainous area, or if soil conservation has been poor, there is a high risk of mudslides.
Landslides like this are man-made disasters.
There isnt much that people in Taiwan can do to stop typhoons from striking the island.
But the threat of destructive mudslides could be reduced if we take the right action.
Landslides are caused by disruption of the natural stability of a slope.
This can result when trees are cut down and replaced by farms, roads, or buildings, for instance.
It follows, then, that measures should be taken to keep hillsides stable.
These measures might include proper geological surveys to identify vulnerable places, the planting of trees to shore up loose soil, and better regulation of agriculture and the construction industry.
These are largely matters of government concern, but the public can also play a role.
People living in high-risk areas should make themselves aware of any emergency or evacuation plans that local authorities have put in place.
During periods of heavy rainfall, such as when typhoons strike, residents need to listen carefully to the radio or watch TV for warnings of intense rain.
Mudslides are an extreme danger against which it is necessary to take every possible precaution.
