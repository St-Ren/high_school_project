Unit 4  Butterflies and Elephants.
Seven hundred faces stared at me.
Some people were giggling, while others were quietly attentive.
Wearing my white polka-dot dress, I stood onstage.
I was one of the six girls in my senior class who had been voted to be a princess to represent our high school in a huge, citywide festival.
When I was selected, I knew that Id eventually have to give a speech.
Despite my considerable anxiety, I decided to take on this challenge and conquer my fear of public speaking.
Little did the audience know that as I stood there looking all together, my heart was actually beating like a drum.
Then, I decided that this must not be true at all.
Of course they could hear the hammering of my heart.
Dear God, what am I doing I said to myself.
No butterflies remained in my stomach.
No, now I had elephants.
The thundering herd was threatening to trample me thoroughly.
Nervousness filled my veins, making me feel dizzy.
I stepped toward the microphone.
Aware of all the heads bobbing in the sea of faces before me, I began my speech.
A few phrases tumbling out quickly, the tremor in my voice was noticeable.
However, a growing sense of confidence began to build inside of me as the crowd quieted down.
My muscles relaxed.
My breathing eased.
Maybe the weeks of practicing before my bedroom mirror were paying off.
Maybe I can really do this, I thought to myself.
Then, just thirty seconds into my three-minute speech, the microphone died.
Glaring at the offending instrument of my potential downfall, I wondered if it might be possible to strangle an inanimate object!
How could the microphone do this to me?
Outwardly paralyzed with horror and humiliation, I frantically plotted what I should do next.
Should I run off the stage in despair or wait for the power to return to the microphone?
Time seemed to stand still, crystallizing a moment of opportunityXwhen intent suddenly meant everything.
I chose neither of my first two quick solutions.
Instead, I faced this unexpected obstacle directly: I closed my eyes to still my quaking limbs and forced out the hot anxiety in my lungs to make room for what I intended to do.
I took a deep breath, paused for a moment, and then continued.
Before me, the hushed audience focused on each new word, as if I were a bird, singing out for the very first time.
Knowing that I had made the right decision, I felt the blood return to my pale face, along with a calm, sure feeling.
Next, my voice boomed out.
It reached far into the recesses of the upper balcony, where I could see people no longer bobbing in front of me, but sitting fascinated, and maybe amazed at how determined I was.
My soliloquy ended.
Then, all of the students shouted and cheered, the large room vibrating with applause.
I appeared humble on the outside, yet I was bursting with pride on the inside.
I had mastered my greatest fear, along with a big extra dose of unforeseen adversity.
I had driven the butterflies and elephants out of my stomach.
At that moment, I honestly believed that this loud cheering was a new kind of elephant thundering in my ears!
In an instant, a realization swept over me like a giftXI could do anything!
Taking a bow in my white polka-dot dress, I felt a glow that I would never forget.
I realized that inside of me existed a young woman once testedXa young woman who was bolder than her fear.
