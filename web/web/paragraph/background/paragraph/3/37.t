Charlie Brown is one of the main characters, along with Snoopy and others, in the extremely popular American comic strip Peanuts, the longest-running comic strip in the world with a readership of 3 million worldwide.
Charlie is an unusual choice for a hero.
He is a plain-looking schoolboy with a round face.
A straight and upright kid, he displays few features of the typical heroes like Superman, Spider-Man or Batman.
Rather, his name has become a synonym for the eternal loser: we say "He is a real Charlie Brown."
He loses countless baseball games and often gets tricked by Lucy van Pelt when he is trying to kick a football.
He never plays a game of checkers without getting beaten, and he never manages to successfully fly a kite.
What's worse, he never gets valentines or Christmas cards; he only gets rocks when he goes trick-or-treating on Halloween.
He is prone to depression and anxiety, constantly wonders if he is liked or respected, and always hopes for people's approval and acceptance.
But he is a lovable child with a good heart and endless determination and hope.
His stories strike a sympathetic chord with millions of people.
There are naturally many similarities between Charlie Brown and Charles M. Schulz, the cartoonist who created Peanuts.
As a matter of fact, Charles Schulz once indicated that Peanuts is autobiographical.
Like Charlie Brown's parents, Schulz's father was a barber and his mother a housewife.
Like Charlie Brown, he was timid and withdrawn, and he kept a dog as a pet.
Like Charlie Brown, he played for his neighborhood baseball team, and like Charlie Brown, the worried young Schulz couldn't sleep on the night before a game.
Failure and rejection were the two themes that dominated Schulz's childhood and early adulthood.
There is even a similarity in their names - Charlie is a nickname for Charles.
The popular saying "The harder you fall, the higher you bounce back" is definitely true of Schulz.
He made up his mind to become a cartoonist when he was seven, but his initial works kept getting rejected.
Years later, he said he could still remember vividly "the sinking feeling" when he received rejection notes in the mail.
In World War II, Schulz was drafted into the military.
After the war, he lost at least three girlfriends because they had fallen in love with other men.
In 1, he traveled to Chicago to show his works to some prospective publishers, only to be rejected by all of them.
His response was to go back home and keep drawing, and he constantly refined his illustrations.
He took the rejections as constructive criticism and an opportunity to improve  himself.
Even when his own mother didn't believe in his dreams, he didn't give up.
Schulz said later, "I was never discouraged.
I always knew I was getting closer and closer."
His perseverance eventually led to the creation of Peanuts, which soon became one of the most influential and well-received comic strips of all time.
He never blamed anyone for his failures along the way.
In fact, he gave credit to his failures for making him more determined to finally achieve success.
This is the spirit that the author attempts to convey in his comic strips.
Charlie Brown never blames or takes revenge on those who defeat him or let him down.
He keeps trying to fly a kite and keeps going to the baseball mound over and over again, hoping to pitch a winning game.
He firmly believes that he will make it big someday, however difficult or unlikely that may be.
"Determined" is a better word to describe him than "stubborn."
Life is full of frustrations and setbacks for him, and perhaps for most people.
But it is a kind heart and endless persistence that keep the world moving and define a true hero.
That hero could be Charlie Brown, or any one of us.
