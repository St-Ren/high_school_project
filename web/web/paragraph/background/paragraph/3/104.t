Unit 2 Our True Self Lies Within.
Researchers in the United States of America once conducted a psychological study called the Scar Experiment, which ended up provoking a lot of public discussion.
In this experiment, the researchers notified ten volunteers that the objective was to observe how people would respond when they saw someone with a physical defect, particularly those with scars on their faces.
After being informed of the purpose of the study, these participants were placed in ten small rooms in which no mirrors could be found.
There, a Hollywood make-up artist put a gruesome scar on the left cheek of each participant.
Then, the make-up artist showed the participant his or her new look in the mirror.
Next, the participants were told that for fear that the make-up might come off, a sticky substance would be applied.
The scar, however, was actually then swept away without the subjects knowledge.
Later, these unsuspecting participants were sent off to the waiting rooms of different clinics to experience how people would react to them.
When returning to the research laboratory, they reported that people were unfriendly and repeatedly peeked at their scars.
As a matter of fact, these volunteers looked the same as normal.
Their consciousness of other peoples unkind acts came from their own assumptions: They believed that the scar would unavoidably draw the publics attention and make people treat them rudely and offensively.
In other words, they were influenced by a sense of inferiority.
The sense of inferiority, according to the researchers, is strongly associated with the environment in which one develops.
A study indicated that in a traditional Chinese family, a child would finally get a compliment only after receiving ten savage lectures.
At a Chinese school, the chances of students being scolded are seven times higher than those of being acclaimed.
If children get criticized continually as they mature, they are bound to face an identity crisis and may even start to disapprove of themselves in the course of time.
As kids grow up, negative remarks can become mental scars.
These negative remarks can also bruise their egos, undermine their confidence, and, hence, affect how they see themselves.
A boy once sadly told his mother that due to the pimples all over his face, he was not popular with his classmates.
No matter how hard she tried to reason with him, it seemed that the boy wasnt open to any form of persuasion.
Were the pimples the real reason why he and his classmates didnt get along?
Absolutely not!
It turned out that the boys father had been so worried and anxious that he had brought up the boy in a negative way, and the fathers long-term biting comments had led to the boys sense of inferiority and had greatly impacted the boys judgment.
For fear of being isolated, the boy had mistakenly blamed his unpopularity on the pimples.
On the other hand, Lena Maria, the author of Footnotes: A Life Without Limits, was born with only one leg and without any upper limbs.
Even so, she was raised as if she were not physically challenged at all.
Her parents love for her knew no bounds, and this made her appreciate her life, no matter how limited it would be.
Whats more, her cheerful mentality adds fullness to her life.
Thus, she has never felt different from others, in spite of her birth defects.
One day, a girl in her class intended to embarrass her by sarcastically saying, Good morning, the girl with only one leg. Not even upset, Lena replied with a beaming smile, Good morning, two-legged girl.
Whether we are facially scarred or physically deficient in some other way, others cant hurt our feelings on condition that we embrace ourselves.
However, if we deprive ourselves of our own self-esteem and regard ourselves as unworthy, then a trivial pimple on the face can cause us to have insecurity problems in our relationships.
So, dont let a sense of inferiority, a scar, or even a pimple steer you wrong.
After all, people see you just the way you see yourself.
