Drug lords, millionaire wannabes, and the North Korean government have perfected methods to make knockoffs of U.S. dollar bills.
Now the scientists in charge of making the real dough are f?ighting back with an anti-counterfeiting $100 bill.
Every single American bank note is printed at Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) facilities.
There is only one factory in the world printing U.S. dollars, but there is at least $70 million worth of fake U.S. currency floating around, of which 75 percent is in $100 bills.
Largely because of the introduction of inexpensive scanners and printers, more and more fake bills are entering circulation: From 1997 to 2007, the amount of passed counterfeit bills nearly doubled, to $64.9 million.
Professional fakers are making bills that are more convincing than ever.
Blame the digital revolution.
In the early 1990s, only 1 percent of all counterfeit currency was created with high-quality printers, scanners, and copiers, says Michael Merritt, a deputy assistant director for the Secret Service, which is in charge of policing counterfeit currency.
Now its 56 percent, however.
One notable offender is Art Williams, Jr., who has been arrested twice in the past decade for printing roughly $10 million in fake American currency using a scanner and a high-quality printer.
The Secret Service estimates that 75 percent of the $564 billion in counterfeit US$100 bills are circulating overseas.
Because of its high prof?ile and constant known value, the American hundred has become the real currency in many unstable economies.
However, tracking down fakes all over the world is too diff?icult for one agency.
In addition, there are far more evil counterfeiters and opportunists than millionaire wannabes like Williams.
For at least the past two decades, North Korea has been using the same sophisticated money-printing process as the U.S. to create a superdollarw a bill that matches nearly every one of its security featuresw in order to simultaneously fatten the countrys national funds and devalue the American dollar at the same time.
(According to the Secret Service, $5.3 million in superdollars were passed in 2005, all as $100 bills.)
Although most of the American financial brain trust is working extensive hours to digitize your dough, the BEP is working to protect with a combination of tricks in anti-counterfeiting tech.
Once the new bill hits ATMs in the next few years, even the smartest counterfeiters will be forced to start from square one.
