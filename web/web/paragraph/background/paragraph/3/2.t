Lin Hwai-min and the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre.
When Time magazine selected Lin Hwai-min as one of its 2005 heroes of Asia, his countrypeople in Taiwan felt proud.
But they were not surprised.
In their minds, Lin clearly deserved the title.
Over the past three decades, he has proved himself again and again as a choreographer of great ambition, courage, and genius.
Lins ambition of setting up a dance company started in the early 1970s.
It must have been like a wild dream at the time.
He was only twenty-six years old.
There were few people in Taiwan then who knew anything about modern dance, and there were few studios or theaters to practice or perform in.
But Lin refused to give up his dream.
He borrowed money and began gathering and training dancers, practicing with them wherever he could.
When they finally began performing, in 1973, they also presented their dances wherever they could, in big cities and in small towns, in formal theaters and in high school auditoriums.
No matter where they appeared, Lins dancers were greeted by enthusiastic audiences all over the island.
From these humble but promising beginnings, Lin built the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre into the most famous and influential performing group in Taiwan.
Today, the company has its own spacious studio in suburban Taipei and an extensive performance schedule that includes shows at the most famous theaters around the world.
Locally, Cloud Gates performances are often sold out, and outdoor performances such as those held at the CKS Memorial Park in Taipei attract tens of thousands of fans.
Abroad, the company has often been praised as the most outstanding dance company in Asia.
Clearly, Lins dream has turned into a source of pride not only for himself and his dancers, but also for the people of Taiwan.
What makes Cloud Gate so praiseworthy is Lins unique style of choreography, especially his great talent for fusing East and West.
This fusion is evident in the movements he uses in his dances as well as the images and the themes.
He uses modern dance and ballet movements, for example, but combines these with movements inspired by a wide range of Asian traditions: Chinese opera, tai-chi and chi-kong, Buddhist meditation, aboriginal ritual dances, the classical dances of Indonesia, India, Korea, and Japan, and also everyday motions that are familiar to Asian peoples, for example, the motions of people planting rice or burning incense.
Lin himself has described his dances as a mixture of many, many things.
The images seen in Lins dances are also an original mixture of many things.
Once again, the Chinese and Asian-inspired images are especially striking.
In one dance, for example, the back of the stage is covered with a giant lotus painting; in another, huge calligraphy scrolls hang from the ceiling; and in still another, rice grains are poured onto the stage in a continuous stream, resembling a sort of unusual but beautiful waterfall.
While images such as these reflect a traditional Chinese sensibility, other images focus on a more modern-day experience.
Certainly, Lins dances are full of tremendous diversity.
Its no wonder that Time magazine has described him as Asias synthesizing dance genius.
The same is true of Lin Hwai-mins themesXthat is, the stories and ideas that he expresses in his dances.
He often deals with local or Asian themes, but always infuses them with a universal dimension.
For example, his most famous piece, Legacy, first performed in 1978, tells the story of the first Chinese settlers in Taiwan, and the hardships and struggles they encountered when they sailed here three hundred years ago from China.
But the dance also clearly reminds audiences of the pioneer stories that are part of many cultures.
Lins other dances have drawn on Chinese literature and philosophy, such as The Dream of the Red Chamber and Songs of the Wanderers.
These dances show Lins reflections on Buddhist philosophy, but they also express the desire that people everywhere have to fulfill their spiritual needs and to find peace and serenity in todays chaotic world.
As Lin has said, his dances explore the landscape of the human heart. And in so doing, he is always able to create unforgettable experiences for audiences everywhere.
