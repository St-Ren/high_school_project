On Top Of the World.
Imagine the amount of practice, effort, and courage it would take to climb to the top of Mount Everest.
Now imagine how hard it would be if you were blind.
Most people would
consider it to be simply impossible, but that is just what Erik Weihenmayer did in May 2001.
And this climb was no oneoff; Weihenmayer has been climbing mountains, skydiving, and skiing since he was a teenager.
Born in 1968 with an eye disease called retinoschisis, Weihenmayer was totally blind by the age of thirteen.
However, throughout his childhood, his parents encouraged him to live as normal a life as possible, sending him to regular schools rather than ones for the sight-impaired.
And Erik himself simply refused to let his blindness interfere with his determination to do what he loved.
He continued his active lifestyle and in high school discovered wrestling, something at which he could compete on equal terms with sighted people.
In 1987, Weihenmayer graduated from high school as the second  best wrestler in the whole state, and he went on to study at Boston College.
By 1993 he had a masters degree in education and was a teacher and wrestling coach.
He was an inspirational teacher, passing on his personal philosophy of focusing on the possibilities of life rather than the limitations.
As he says, I believe in being the best at the things I can do, and letting go of the things I cant do.
I know I will never drive a car and I will never catch a baseball, but there are lifetimes and lifetimes of achievement awaiting me, so I have more than enough to keep me busy.
And he has certainly kept himself busy.
In 1996 he was selected to carry the Olympic torch through the city of Phoenix.
And he is the only sight-impaired man to have climbed the seven summits.
After his ascent of Everest in 2001, he became world famous.
Weihenmayer wrote about his mountain-climbing adventures in an extraordinary book, Touch the Top of the World, published in 2002.
The story he tells is not only inspiring, but also entertaining.
The reader can clearly sense his personal charm as well as his sense of humor.
Much of the proceeds from this book and his other best-selling books and motivational speeches have gone to help the visually impaired in both the United States and around the world.
It is no surprise that in 2008 Weihenmayer was voted one of the twenty most inspirational people in America.
