Laughter Is the Best Medicine.
The human body has the amazing ability to heal itself.
In fact, a doctor who once worked for the New England Journal 1 of Medicine reported that the human body is naturally able to fight off 85 percent of all illnesses people can come down with.
Many doctors would add that a persons emotions and mental attitude may either support or hinder the bodys ability to heal itself.
Studies focusing on the link between emotions and the immune system indicate that negative attitudes, thoughts, and emotions weaken or depress the bodys immune responses.
On the other hand, positive attitudes, thoughts, and emotions like love, joy, laughter, and optimism support the bodys immune responses.
Particularly in the case of laughter, doctors have found clear evidence to back up the claim that it really is the best medicine.
First of all, laughing relaxes the muscles.
As one study showed, people were able to feel more relaxed after watching funny cartoons than after looking at beautiful pictures of nature.
But you dont need a lot of sophisticated equipment to test this effect yourself.
The next time someone youre with has a good laugh, ask them how they feel afterwards.
Typically, people respond by describing how relaxed they feel.
Laughter also provides excellent exercise for your heart.
After a good laugh, a persons heart rate is well above normal, and it remains high for up to five minutes.
For this reason, some doctors refer to laughter as internal jogging.
Another key benefit of laughter is that it actually boosts the immune system by stimulating the bodys production of immunoglobulin A (IgA).
IgA is what the body uses to fight colds and the flu.
Several studies have found that after people watch just thirty minutes of a comedy video, the level of IgA in their saliva and blood increases.
And this effect extends to both adults and children.
Although no studies have been able to show a clear link between laughter and pain reduction, many patients have reported a decrease in pain after a good laugh.
Some doctors claim this reduction in pain could be linked to chemicals produced in the blood.
Or patients might feel less pain because their muscles are more relaxed, or because they are simply distracted from thinking about their pain.
Whatever the truth may be, there are plenty of people who would agree with the comedian Groucho Marx, who claimed, A clown is like aspirin, only he works twice as fast.
