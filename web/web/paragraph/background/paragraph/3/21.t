The Heat Is On.
It has been estimated by some scientists that up to a third of all species of life on Earth could be extinct by 2050.
For this potential catastrophe, they put the blame squarely on global warming.
Higher temperatures are already having a marked effect on the natural world.
In many areas, plants are flowering earlier in the spring than usual, and animal breeding patterns have been disrupted.
Of greater concern to humans are the heat waves and the increasing number of devastating storms.
At various times over the past decade, people have died because of extremely high temperatures in Italy, Greece, Russia, and other countries.
In the past few years, terrible storms have also brought destruction to different parts of the world.
Hurricane Katrina, for instance, caused massive damage and misery in the city of New Orleans in 2005, and Typhoon Morakot brought great loss of life to southern Taiwan in 2009.
Whats worse, an even bigger disaster could be lying in wait: the possibility of rising sea levels.
This trend towards higher temperatures is thought to be the result of a stronger greenhouse effect. This term refers to the way the Earth retains heat from the sun.
It is part of a natural process in which carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases help trap the suns energy.
However, in recent decades, the amount of greenhouse gases in the Earths atmosphere has increased.
This is due to human activities such as industry and the burning of fossil fuels.
As a result, more energy is trapped in the atmosphere, causing the planet to warm up.
The problem is made worse by deforestation, since trees absorb carbon dioxide.
No one can be certain about the actual consequences of global warming.
Some scientists have predicted that the average temperature of the Earth could increase by one to six degrees Celsius by the end of this century.
If the latter number is more accurate, the outcome could be catastrophic.
It could result in the melting of the polar ice caps, causing rises in sea levels that could wipe out many coastal cities.
Taiwans low-lying regions, where most of its people live, could end up under water.
Not all experts are predicting such disaster, but the majority accept that the effects of climate change will be severe.
For one thing, climate change will certainly alter many of the worlds habitats and ecosystems.
Some places depend on a delicate balance of weather and soil conditions which could easily be upset, resulting in a serious threat to many living things.
In the past, climate change took place over a long period of time, and plants and animals were able to slowly adapt to the new conditions.
In recent years, extreme weather has occurred so often that both plants and animals have encountered disasters.
If future climate change takes place as quickly as some scientists have predicted, many species, both on land and in the oceans, will be unable to react quickly enough to survive.
Human beings will also suffer from climate change, whether they live near the sea or not.
It will affect peoples health both directly and indirectly.
Some of the direct effects will be the greater risk of heat stress and other related problems that can result from high temperatures and excessive humidity.
Indirect effects of climate change, such as increased air pollution and changes in food and water supplies, will also have a severe impact on human health.
Poor countries will not have the resources to prevent or treat such health problems, and this means that the most vulnerable people will be children and the elderly in developing regions.
So what can be done about the problem?
At the political level, there have been international meetings and promises made by many governments to reduce greenhouse gases.
However, climate conferences in Japan (1997), Denmark (2009), and Mexico (2010) have yielded mixed results, mainly because there is much disagreement over the right measures to take.
Still, prominent people like former U.S. Vice President Al Gore continue to campaign vigorously for more effective action.
In the meantime, there is much that ordinary people can do to fight global warming.
They can try to reduce their so-called carbon footprint by consuming less energy.
Even a high school student like you can cut down on your electricity use.
You can always turn lights and appliances off when you dont need them, for example.
And cycling or walking to school can lead to a small reduction in gasoline consumption.
Every little bit helps.
