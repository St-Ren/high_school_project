Dear Teacher,
I would like to introduce my son Wind-Wolf.
He is probably what you would consider a typical Indian kid.
He was born and raised on the reservation.
He has black hair, dark brown eyes, and an olive complexion.
Like so many Indian children his age, he is shy and quiet in the classroom.
He is five years old, in kindergarten, and I can't understand why you have already labeled him a "slow learner."
At the age of five, he has already been through quite an education compared with his peers in Western society.
He has been with his mother when she gathered herbs for healing.
He has sat with his uncles in a rowboat on the river while they fished with gillnets.
He has had many opportunities to watch his ceremonial leaders use different kinds of colorful feathers preparing for the sacred dances and rituals.
And he also listened to the elders as they told creation stories and animal legends and sang songs around the campfires.
It takes a long time to understand and reflect on these kinds of experiences, so maybe that is why you think my Indian child is a slow learner.
He is not culturally "disadvantaged," but he is culturally different.
If you ask him how many months there are in a year, he will probably tell you 13.
He will respond this way because he has been taught by our traditional people.
He knows that some eagles may have 12 tail feathers or 7.
He can probably count more than 40 different kinds of birds.
He may have trouble writing his name on a piece of paper, but he knows how to say it and many other things in different Indian languages.
He is not fluent yet because he is only 5 years old and required by law to attend your educational system, learn your language, your values, your way of thinking, and your methods of teaching and learning.
Wind-Wolf was not prepared for his first tentative step into your world; neither were you appreciative of his culture.
On the first day of class, you had difficulty with his name.
You wanted to call him Wind, insisting that somehow Wolf must be his middle name.
While you are trying to teach him your new methods, he may be looking out the window as if day-dreaming.
Because he has been taught to watch and study the changes in nature.
In his young mind, and almost by instinct, he knows that this is the time of year he is supposed to be with his people gathering and preparing fish, deer meat, and native plants and herbs, and learning his assigned tasks in this role.
He is caught between worlds, torn by different cultural systems.
So dear teacher, I want to introduce you my son Wind-Wolf, who is not really a "typical" kid after all.
What you say and what you do in the classroom, what you teach and how you teach it, and what you say and what you don't say will have a significant effect on the potential failure or success of my child.
Please remember that this is the primary year of his education and development.
All I ask is that you work with me, not against me, to help educate my child in the best way.
My son Wind-Wolf is not an empty glass coming into your class to be filled.
He is a full basket coming into a different environment and society with something special to share.
Please let him share his knowledge, heritage, and culture with you and his peers.
Sincerely,
Robert Lake
