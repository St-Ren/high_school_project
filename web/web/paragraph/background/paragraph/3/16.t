Poems of Wisdom.
Poetry, like all forms of literature and art, is capable of opening up new worlds to us.
Which world a particular poem opens will depend on the particular type of poem it is.
Some poems are descriptive, meant to give us a deep impression of some idea or image.
For example, Emily Dickinsons Hope Is the Thing with Feathers impresses us with the comparison of hope to a bird, and Joseph Parrys New Friends and Old Friends uses silver and gold to describe these two types of friends.
Other poems are written so that we can share the poets emotional experience, perhaps of love and joy, grief and sorrow, or confusion and conflict, as that in A. E. Housmans lines The heart out of the bosom/Was never given in vain. Another type of poem reveals to us some wisdom, as Shelley tells us, If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind Or as Victor Hugo writes, A house is built of logs and stone .../A home is built of loving deeds.
Numerous words of wisdom can also be found in Shakespeares works, such as, If all the year were playing holidays/To sport would be as tedious as to work, or All the worlds a stage,/And all the men and women merely players.
The latter type of poetry, poetry of wisdom, can be especially meaningful to us when we are searching for answers to the questions about life.
These are poems that we can turn to for guidance and enlightenment whenever we feel lost or confused.
Many of these lines of wisdom have become proverbs: Good fences make good neighbors, To err is human, to forgive, divine, Whats done cannot be undone, The hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world, to list just a few.
Following are three examples of such poems of wisdom.
X by Sarah Brooks
Loss and Gain
When I compare
What I have lost with what I have gained,
What I have missed with what attained,
Little room do I find for pride.
I am aware
How many days have been idly spent;
How like an arrow the good intent
Has fallen short or been turned aside.
But who shall dare
To measure loss and gain in this wise?
Defeat may be victory in disguise;
The lowest ebb is the turn of the tide.
Xby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-82)
Laugh, and the world laughs with you;
Weep, and you weep alone;
For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,
But has trouble enough of its own.
Sing, and the hills will answer;
Sigh, it is lost on the air;
The echoes bound to a joyful sound,
But shrink from voicing care.
Rejoice, and men will seek you;
Grieve, and they turn and go;
They want full measure of all your pleasure,
But they do not need your woe.
Be glad, and your friends are many;
Be sad, and you lose them allX
There are none to decline your nectared wine,
But alone you must drink lifes gall.
Feast, and your halls are crowded;
Fast, and the world goes by,
Succeed and give, and it helps you live,
But no man can help you die.
There is room in the halls of pleasure
For a large and lordly train,
But one by one we must all file on
Through the narrow aisles of pain.
Xby Ella Wheeler Wilcox (1850-1919)
The mountain and the squirrel
Had a quarrel,
And the former called the latter Little Prig.
Bun replied,
You are doubtless very big;
But all sorts of things and weather
Must be taken in together,
To make up a year
And a sphere.
And I think it no disgrace
To occupy my place.
If Im not so large as you,
You are not so small as I,
And not half so spry.
Ill not deny you make
A very pretty squirrel track;
Talents differ; all is well and wisely put;
If I cannot carry forests on my back,
Neither can you crack a nut.
Xby Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-82)
