Venice is a city like no other.
Belonging neither to the land nor to the sea, it is a city of canals and lagoons, a place where courtyards are connected by bridges and journeys are made by water taxis or gondolas.
But the water that has brought the city so much fame has proved to be a double-edged sword, as floods often occur.
No strangers to such events, Venetians calmly shut their protective steel doors, put on their trusty boots, and continue with their daily activities.
Evidently, water is very much a part of their lives.
However, the devastating flood on November 4, 1, made it clear that water would eventually threaten the city's existence.
On this day, a high tide swept in from the Venetian Lagoon and submerged the city for a disturbing 1 hours, leaving St. Mark's Square 4 feet underwater.
The massive flood drew attention to a serious problem: throughout the past century, Venice had been sinking at an unprecedented rate.
Venice used to sink by less than one centimeter every one hundred years and was considered to be a safe place.
In the last century alone, however, it fell by astonishing 2 centimeters.
This has translated into far more frequent floods-roughly a hundred floods a year now, as compared to seven a year just two centuries ago.
Two factors have contributed to this significant change: an accelerated rate of subsidence was responsible for about 5 percent of the 2-centimeter drop, while the rising sea level was responsible for the other 5 percent.
Subsidence had always occurred but at a very limited rate.
However, since 1, this rate has increased dramatically because the water that helps to support the city began to be pumped out from the land underneath and used for industrial purposes.
Although this practice has been banned, the damage cannot be undone.
People may not be destroying the land underneath Venice anymore, but another man-made problem now poses an even greater threat to the city's future: rising sea levels.
Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, mankind has used huge quantities of fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide when they're burnt.
Excessive carbon dioxide leads to global warming, which in turn causes the polar ice caps to melt and the world's oceans to rise.
Scientists say that if this process continues unchecked, Venice will not be around to see the 2nd century.
Venice's problem is important not only because the world might lose one of its most beautiful cities, but also because it involves environmental issues that the whole world needs to face.
If it were not for these very issues, the islands in the Republic of Kiribati that have disappeared would still exist, and the people of Maldives wouldn't have to worry about being the next potential victims.
The crisis caused by the melting of polar ice caps and consequent rising sea levels will only become more severe.
We are also damaging the natural habitats of animals, exhausting the earth's resources, and disrupting its climate systems.
In recent decades, we have been altering for the worse the way our planet functions at an incredible and unsustainable rate.
This is not just something theoretical but a concrete fact.
It's high time that we reversed our destructive ways before it is too late!
To save Venice and many other cities will require the collective effort of everyone-governments, institutions and individuals-all across the globe.
Only through the determination and dedication of every one of us can this goal be achieved.
