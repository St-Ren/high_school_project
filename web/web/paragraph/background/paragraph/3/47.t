The Seven-Day Anti-procrastination Plan.
Many students procrastinate, or put off, doing an assignment until the very last minute.
Here are seven strategies you can use to eliminate procrastination.
The suggestions are tied to the days of the week to help you remember them.
Monday: Make It Meaningful
What is important about the job you've been putting off?
List all the benefits of completing it.
Look at it in relation to your goals.
Be specific about the rewards for getting it done, including how you will feel when the task is completed.
Tuesday: Take It Apart
Break a big job into a series of small ones you can do in fifteen minutes or less.
If a long reading assignment intimidates you, divide it into two-page or three-page sections.
Make a list of the sections and cross them off as you complete them so you can see your progress.
Wednesday: Write an Intention Statement
Write an intention statement on an index card.
For example, if you can't get started with your report on Beethoven, you might write, "I intend to find at least five articles about him by 9:00 p.m.
I will reward myself with an hour of guilt-free recreational reading."
Carry the card with you or post it in your study area where you will see it often.
Thursday: Tell Everyone
Announce publicly your intention to get the job done.
Tell a friend you plan to learn one hundred new English words a week, for example.
Include anyone who will suggest ways to get it done.
Make the world your support group.
Friday: Find a Reward
You deserve a reward for accomplishing a task, but construct rewards carefully.
Be willing to withhold them if you do not complete the task.
Don't pick a movie as a reward for studying biology if you plan to go to the movie anyway.
You might find that movies, new clothes, or an extra hour riding your bicycle are more fun when you've earned them.
Saturday: Settle It Now
Do it now.
The minute you notice yourself procrastinating, you should plunge into the task.
Imagine yourself at a mountain lake, poised to dive in.
Gradual immersion would be slow torture.
Then be sure to savor the feeling of having the task behind you.
Sunday: Say No
When you keep pushing a task into the low-priority category, re-examine the purpose for doing it at all.
If you realize you really don't intend to do something, quit telling yourself that you will.
That's procrastinating.
Just say NO, and you don't have to carry around the baggage of an undone task.
If you are going to procrastinate, you can also choose not to.
Consider the consequences of postponing.
Recognizing the costs of procrastination may just help you kick the habit.
Finally, ask yourself straight out if procrastination actually works in your favor.
Some people really do thrive under pressure, and if you do your best work when you are pushing hard against an imminent deadline, you may be one of those people.
