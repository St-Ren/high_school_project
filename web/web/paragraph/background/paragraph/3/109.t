Unit 7 The Woman That Never Dies.
Theres a photo on my wall of a woman Ive never met, its left corner torn and patched together with tape.
Its the late 1940s, and she hasnt yet attained the age of thirty.
Her light brown skin is smooth, her eyes still young and playful.
She is unaware of the tumor growing inside herXa tumor that would leave her five children motherless and that would also give rise to the evolution of medicine.
Beneath the photo, a caption says this womans name is Henrietta Lacks, Helen Lane, or Helen Larson.
No one knows who took that picture, but it has appeared innumerable times in magazines and science textbooks, and on blogs and on laboratory walls.
Shes usually identified as Helen Lane, but generally speaking, she has no name at all.
Shes simply called HeLa, the code name given to the worlds first immortal human cellsXher cells, cut from her cervix just months before she died.
Her real name is Henrietta Lacks.
Ive spent years gazing at that photo, pondering what kind of life she led, what happened to her offspring, and what she would think about cells from her cervix living on foreverXbought, sold, packaged, and shipped by the trillions to laboratories around the world.
Ive tried to imagine how shed feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most notable advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, and in vitro fertilization.
Im pretty confident that sheXlike most of usXwould be staggered to hear that there are now an infinite number of her cells growing in laboratories.
Theres no way of knowing exactly how many of Henriettas cells are alive today.
One scientist estimates that if we could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, theyd weigh more than 50 billion kilogramsXan inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing.
Another scientist calculated that if we could lay all HeLa cells ever grown end-to-end, theyd wrap around the earth at least three times, spanning more than 350 million feet.
In her prime, Henrietta herself stood only a bit over five feet tall.
Henrietta died in 1951 from a brutal case of cervical cancer.
But before she expired, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish.
Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died.
Henriettas were different: They reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped.
In this unprecedented development, they became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory.
Henriettas cells have now been living outside her body far longer than they ever lived inside it.
If we go to almost any cell-culture lab in the world and open its freezers, well probably find millionsXif not billionsXof Henriettas cells in small vials on ice.
Many people believe that HeLa cells have been one of the most important developments in medicine over the last hundred years.
But frankly speaking, no one really knew much about this woman.
Years later, I finally tracked down a few magazine articles from the seventies about her.
Ebony quoted Henriettas husband, All I remember is that she had this disease, and right after she died, they called me in the office wanting to get my permission to take a sample of some kind.
I decided not to let them.Jet said the family was angryXangry that Henriettas cells were being sold for twenty-five dollars a vial, and angry that articles had been published about the cells without their knowledge.
It said, Pounding in the back of their heads was a gnawing feeling that science and the press had taken advantage of them.
The articles all ran photos of Henriettas family.
The caption said the family had learned just a few months earlier that Henriettas cells were still alive, whereas at that point, shed been dead for twenty-five years.
Then, I came up with the idea that Id write a book that was a biography of both the cells and the woman they came fromXsomeones daughter, wife, and mother.
