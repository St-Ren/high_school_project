Feeling sad is one of the important aspects of human nature.
Here are findings by some experts, who tell us how and why feeling sad is a good way to deal with troubles in our life.
In one of his books, Jerome Wakefield, a professor at New York University, mentions that feeling down after your heart is broken is normal and may even be beneficial.
Recently, Wakefield's students have been coming up to him after they broke up with a boyfriend or girlfriend because their parents are pressuring them to seek counseling and other medical intervention for their sadness; often the kids want no part of it.
"Can you talk to them for me?"
they ask Wakefield.
Rather than "listening to medicine," they want to listen to their hearts.
His argument is that these students' response reflects an important aspect of human nature.
University of Illinois psychologist Ed Diener, who has studied happiness for a quarter century, finds that the Scots and many other peoples like being gloomy, and don't appreciate being told they should be happier.
"They say too much happiness might not be such a good thing, no matter where it comes from," says Diener.
He believes it's wrong for the "happiness industry" to send the message that moderate levels of well-being aren't enough: not only can we all be happier, but we practically have a duty to be so.
He argues that what was considered normal sadness is not something to be smothered, or avoided.
Eric Wilson, a professor of English at Wake Forest University, made every effort to smooth out his habitual frown and wear a sunny smile, since a happy expression can lead to genuinely happy feelings.
He even began to exercise his capacity for enthusiasm.
When neither of these made him happy, he accepted his melancholy side again and concluded that such a happiness movement was no good for him at all.
Americans' fixation on happiness, he writes, fosters a craven disregard for the value of sadness.
These academics believe the problem of constant, extreme happiness should not be surprising, since negative emotions evolved for a reason.
Fear tips us off to the presence of danger, for instance.
Sadness, too, seems to be part of our biological heritage: apes, dogs and elephants all display something that looks like sadness.
A study finds that those with the greatest sense of well-being were more likely to die in any given period of time than the mildly content were.
Being "up" all the time can cause you to play down very real threats.
They further argue that only by experiencing sadness can we experience the fullness of the human condition.
Their studies show that when you are in a negative frame of mind, you become more logical, more critical and more innovative.
Abraham Lincoln was not limited by his dark moods, and Beethoven composed his later works in a melancholic state.
Vincent van Gogh, Emily Dickinson and other artistic geniuses saw the world through a glass darkly.
Even the creator of
"Peanuts," Charles M. Schulz, was known for his gloom.
 People who are somewhat discontented are more motivated to improve both their own lot and the lot of their community.
In contrast, people at the top of the happiness charts feel no such urgency.
"If you're totally satisfied with your life and with how things are going in the world," says Diener, "you don't feel very motivated to work for change.
Be wary when people tell you that you should be happier."
