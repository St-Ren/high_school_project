Dont Hold Back Your Tears.
Crying is a normal, natural part of human life.
The first sounds a newborn baby makes are cries, and crying is a babys only means of communicating until it begins to coo and babble at nine to twelve weeks of age.
Crying is most often associated with grief, rage, and sadness, but as many athletes will attest, frustration and joy can also trigger tears.
The fact is, when faced with an overwhelming emotion, almost anyone will burst into tears.
Of course, we are much more accustomed to seeing women weep, and in most cultures men who cry are seen as unmanly.
This, however, has not always been the case.
In ancient Greece, Aristotle believed that crying led to emotional cleansing.
In Greek mythology, heroes sob shamelessly over their fallen comrades-in-arms, and fathers as well as mothers lament their childrens deaths with tears rolling down their cheeks.
But by the time of the Industrial Revolution, tears had become a sign of weakness, and men were seldom seen crying in public.
This tendency has continued into modern times.
In the 1972 U.S. presidential primaries, Edmund Muskie was seen crying in front of the media while defending his wife against personal verbal attacks.
Many believe that those tears lost him the election that year.
However, as a sign of how things have changed, Bill Clinton shed tears on a number of occasions during his term as president and even won support for showing his sensitive side to the nation.
Perhaps society is beginning to recognize that crying may in fact be good for us.
Almost all animals shed tears, but many believe that only humans shed tears under emotional duress.
Although some say that other animals, like elephants and seals, cry when they feel pain, there is little scientific proof that these tears are caused by emotions.
They are most likely basal tears or reflex tears.
Basal tears are tears that keep the eyes from drying up, and they fight bacterial infection.
Reflex tears are created when our eyes are bothered by irritants, like pollen or dust.
While humans, of course, do shed these kinds of tears, we also have the unique ability to create emotional tears.
Emotional tears differ from basal or reflex tears in their chemical composition.
They contain far more toxins and hormones than other kinds of tears.
This fact has led scientists to believe that crying emotional tears has a cleansing and curative effect, as well as providing an emotional outlet, much as Aristotle believed 2,500 years ago.
By crying, we vent our anguish and grief.
This, combined with the fact that the tears themselves are carrying poisons and toxins out of our bodies, makes crying an important part of dealing with stress.
Its important to realize that holding back tears may be bad for our mental health.
Today more and more public figures, even men, seem willing to show their sensitivity to peoples emotional needs, and society is beginning to recognize that crying is a natural way of coping with pain, stress, and sorrow.
Nowadays, put on a brave face or keep a stiff upper lip may not always be the wisestXthat is, the healthiestXpolicy.
