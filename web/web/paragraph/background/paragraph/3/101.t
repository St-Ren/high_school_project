In a forest, a man stood one winter night watching and listening, as though he was waiting for some beast of the woods to come within the range of his vision, and later, of his rifle.
As he stepped around the trunk of a huge beech, he came face to face with the very man he sought.
The two men stood glaring at each other for a long, silent moment.
Each had a rifle in his hand; each had hate in his heart.
The chance had come to give full play to the passions of a lifetime.
But a man who has been brought up under the code of a restraining civilization cannot easily get up enough nerve to shoot down his neighbor in cold blood and without a word spoken, except for an offense against honor.
And before the moment of hesitation had given way to action, natures own violence overwhelmed them both.
A fierce sound of the storm had been answered by a splitting crash over their heads; and before they could run away, a mass of falling beech tree branches thundered down on them.
Both were alive and struggling, but obviously helplessly pinned down and seriously injured.
At Ulrich von Gradwitzs side, so near that under ordinary circumstances he could almost have touched him, lay Georg Znaeym, alive and struggling, but obviously as helplessly pinned down as himself.
So youre not killed, as you ought to be, he cried.
Ha, caught in the stolen forest, real justice for you!
Im caught in my own forest land, Ulrich responded.
When my men come to release us, you shall die.
Shame on you, caught invading a neighbors land!
I have men, too, close behind me; and they will be here first and do the releasing.
Then, it will be easy for them to roll this mass of trunk right over on the top of you.
My men had orders to follow in ten minutes time.
When they get me outwI will remember your hint.
Both men spoke with the bitterness of possible loss before them, each knowing that it might be a long time before his men would seek him out or find him.
After a while, both had given up the useless struggle to free themselves from the mass of wood; Ulrich managed to use his one free hand to draw out his wine bottle from his coat pocket.
Even so, it was long before he could open the stopper or get any of the liquid down his throat.
The wine was warming and reviving, and he took pity on his enemy.
Could you reach this bottle if I threw it over to you Ulrich asked suddenly.
There is good wine in it.
Let us drink, even if tonight one of us dies.
No, I can scarcely see anything, so much blood around my eyes, Georg said.
Besides, I dont drink wine with an enemy.
Ulrich was silent for a few minutes.
An idea was slowly forming and growing in his brain.
In the pain and faint that Ulrich himself was feeling, the old fierce hatred seemed to be dying down.
Neighbor, he said presently, do as you please if your men come first.
But Ive changed my mind.
If my men are the first to come, you shall be the first to be helped, as though you were my guest.
We have quarreled all our lives over this stupid area of forest where the trees cant even stand upright in a breath of wind.
Lying here tonight, Ive come to think that, if youll help me bury the old quarrel, Ill ask you to be my friend.
Georg was silent for so long that Ulrich thought, perhaps, he had fainted with the pain of his injuries.
Then he spoke slowly, No one living can remember seeing a Znaeym and a Von Gradwitz talking to each other in friendship.
But if we choose to end our hatred tonight, there is none other to interfere, no interlopers from outside.
I would never fire a shot on your land, except when you invited me as a guest; and you should come and shoot with me down in the marshes where the wild fowls are.
I never thought to do other than hate you all my life, but I think I have changed my mind about things, too, this last half-hour.
And you offered me your wine.... Ulrich von Gradwitz, Ill be your friend.
For a time both men were silent, thinking about the wonderful changes that this dramatic reconciliation would bring about.
They lay and waited for help.
And each prayed that his men might be the first to arrive, so that he might be the first to show honorable attention to the enemy that had become a friend.
Presently, as the wind dropped for a moment, Ulrich broke silence.
Lets shout for help, he said.
They wont carry far, Georg said, but we can try.
The two raised their voices in a prolonged hunting call.
A few minutes later, Together again, Ulrich said.
There was silence again for some minutes.
Then Ulrich gave a joyful cry.
I can see figures coming through the wood.
They are following in the way.
Both men raised their voices in as loud a shout as they could muster.
They hear us!
Theyve stopped.
Now they see us.
Theyre running down the hill toward us, Ulrich cried.
How many of them are there Georg asked.
I cant see distinctly, Ulrich said, nine or ten.
Then they are yours, Georg said.
I had only seven out with me.
They are making all the speed they can, Ulrich said gladly.
Are they your men Georg asked.
Are they your men he repeated impatiently as Ulrich did not answer.
No, Ulrich said with an idiotic laugh and hideous fear.
Who are they Georg asked quickly, straining his eyes to see what the other would gladly not have seen.
