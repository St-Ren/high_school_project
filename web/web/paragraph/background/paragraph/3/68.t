You are on the Titanic II.
It has just hit an iceberg and is sinking.
And, just like last time, there are not enough lifeboats.
The captain shouts,
"Women and children first!"
But this time, another voice is heard, "Why women?"
Why, indeed?
Part of the charm of the worldwide successful movie Titanic is the period costume, period beauty, and period class difference.
An audience can enjoy these at a distance.
Oddly, however, of all the period customs in the movie, the old tradition of "women and children first" enjoys total acceptance by modern audiences.
In the theater, just listen to the criticism from the audience of those who try to leave with-or ahead ofthe ladies.
But isn't grouping women with children an outdated practice?
Shouldn't any modern person, let alone feminists, object to it as disrespectful to women?
Yet it is as common today as it was in 1912.
Consider these examples taken from recent newspapers:
Mexico :"Soldiers shot down the people, most of them women and children...."
Burundi :"As many as 200 people, most of them women and children, were killed...."
Croatia :"The former president was charged for the killing in which 103 Muslims, including 33 women and children, were killed...."
At a time when women fly fighter planes, how can one not frown when adult women are normally classed with children?
In the given example of Croatia, it seems, 70 adult men were killed.
Adult women?
Not clear.
When things get serious, when blood starts to flow or when ships start to sink,
you'll find them with children.
Now, children should get special consideration for two reasons: they are helpless and innocent.
In an emergency, it is our responsibility to save them first because they are helpless and put their lives in our hands.
And in wartime, they must be kept safe because they
could have threatened or offended no one.
"Women and children" assumes that women are as dependent on others as five-year-olds.
Such an attitude made sense perhaps at a time when women were not allowed to vote.
Given the disabilities associated with women in 1912, it was only fair and right that a new standard of gender equality not suddenly be set just as lifeboat seats were being handed out.
That respectsuch as giving up your seat on the bus to a womanmade up for the legal and social limitations placed on women at the time.
But today, when women are treated equally in education, in employment, in government, in athletics, and in citizenship, what reduces them to the status of children?
 It is commonly thought that ladies-to-the-lifeboats is an instinct that developed to continue the species: women are
child bearers.
You can continue the species if the women survive and only a few of the men, but not if the men survive
and only a few of the women.
Women are more precious,
biologically speaking, than men.
They deserve the kind of life-protecting respect
we give to that other seed of the future,
The problem with this kind of logic, however, is its sad way of diminishing that role.
It strengthens an old concept that a chicken is just an egg's way of making another egg.
But humans are more than just egg layers.
And polite traditions are more than just survival strategies.
So why do we say "women and children"?
Perhaps it's really "women for children."
The most basic tie between parents and children is maternal.
Women can raise children in ways that men cannot.
And thus, because we value childrenwho would deny them first seats at the lifeboatswomen should go second.
The children need them.
 But this explanation gets you only so far.
What if there are no children on board?
You are on the Titanic III, a singles cruise.
No kids, no moms, no dads.
Now: Iceberg!
Lifeboats!
Here's my scenario.
The men, out of irrational bravery, should let the women go first.
And the women, out of feminist self-respect, should refuse.
Stalemate.
How does this movie end?
How should it end?
Hurry, the ship's going down.
