Unit 5  Dying to Look Good.
Its only human nature to pursue physical attractiveness.
However, some people may go to extremes in order to get the looks they want.
You might be stunned by how far they would goXsome may even sacrifice their health.
For example, those who desire to be thin sometimes deprive themselves of food to keep their weight down.
A few have stomach surgery to restrict the amount of food that they can consume.
It seems that being skinny is their first priority; malnutrition and unpredictable, fatal side effects count for nothing.
In addition to weight, height may be another common worry to many people.
One typical response is to wear shoes with heels, but this isnt good enough for some people who desperately want to be taller.
They will undergo surgery to have their legs lengthened, which is especially remarkable because the whole process is acutely painful and can require spending up to a year in a wheelchair.
The operation itself involves breaking the legs, drilling holes in them, inserting metal rods in each leg, and, finally, allowing new bones to grow in these gaps.
In spite of the fact that most patients have to take painkillers to ease the pain and that there is no guarantee that the surgery will succeed, hundreds of people have this kind of surgery done every year.
Unfortunately, many of them endanger their health as well as their future only to become crippled.
People in the contemporary world are concerned about their appearance indeed.
Nonetheless, it is not just in modern times that people have become obsessed by looking attractive and have risked their health as a result.
In ancient Europe, dark skin was widely perceived as unattractive.
Thus, many ancient Greeks and Romans applied certain make-up to make their faces look pale.
Nevertheless, it never occurred to them that the make-up they applied contained lead, which consequently caused them a variety of health problems like sores and infertility.
Today, though people are aware of this unpleasant fact, many still use similar make-up to whiten their skin.
In contrast to ancient times, pale skin is not that appealing to some people nowadays.
Tanned skin is getting popular, and those who want darker skin often go to tanning salons or take tanning pills to keep up with this fashion.
However, both of these methods can bring about hazardous consequences.
First, artificial tans are achieved with the use of tanning beds, which has been linked to skin cancer.
According to recent scientific research, using a tanning bed more than once a month increases the risk of contracting skin cancer by 55 percent.
Second, tanning pills contain certain kinds of additives that are actually dangerous, even for short-term use.
Not only do these pills cause an itchy rash to develop all over the skin, but they may also lead to an eye disease.
Whats worse, tanning pills can damage ones liver.
It seems that whichever way people choose, getting artificially tanned will end up costing them dear.
Its reasonable for us to try various ways to enhance our appearance, as looking good might increase our confidence and make us happy.
Yet we must keep in mind that, excluding the often perilous methods for becoming more attractive, there are still multiple other ones that we can take advantage of, such as getting a proper amount of exercise and keeping a balanced diet.
After all, it is no use being physically attractive if we are not healthy to enjoy it.
