A Harvard professor conducted a famous psychology experiment back in 1.
The subjects watched a video showing two teams of people, dressed in black and white, passing basketballs and moving around.
The subjects had been instructed to count the number of passes made by the white team.
During the film, a person in a full-body gorilla suit entered and walked between everyone, thumped its chest, and walked off.
The subjects were later asked if they had seen the gorilla.
Over the years, the film has been shown many times to diverse audiences in many different countries, and the results have remained consistent: roughly half of the subjects fail to see the gorilla!
The results from the invisible gorilla experiment may seem astonishing.
But what's even more remarkable was how surprised the subjects were when they found out that they had missed the gorilla.
The way we normally experience this world tricks us into believing that we notice everything that is happening around us.
It leads us to assume that distinctive or unusual objects will catch our attention, while in reality we are often completely unaware of them.
Although only about 5% of the subjects noticed the gorilla, a comprehensive survey suggested that over 7% of them thought that they would surely notice such unexpected objects.
In essence, we perceive far less of our world than we think we do.
This phenomenon is called the "illusion of attention."
How is it that so many people miss something that is so noticeable, something right in front of their eyes?
The human brain's attention span is limited, which means that when people devote their attention to a specific area or aspect of their surroundings, little or no attention can be allocated to the detection of potential irregular objects or occurrences.
In other words, people tend not to notice unexpected objects, even when these appear right where they are looking and thus should be conspicuous.
Here is another good example of the "illusion of attention" phenomenon.
In the early 1s, a NASA scientist was testing the new head-up display technology in commercial jets by having pilots do simulated landing trials with it on board.
This was a new technology that displayed on the windshield the crucial gauges and dials-normally located below the windshield, like the speedometer in your car-which provide much of the crucial information, including the present altitude, velocity and cabin pressure, needed for flying and landing a plane.
In one of the landing trials, the scientist purposely placed another airplane in the middle of the runway.
The highly experienced pilots in that trial had a clear view of the airplane and with the aid of their head-up display, they did not even need to look away from the runway to see their instrument panel down below, as they always had had to do before.
So it seems there was no way that they could have missed this "gorilla."
Amazingly, however, the pilots failed to see the stationary airplane!
Had the scientist not aborted the landing, they would have collided with it.
The pilots had focused their attention so much on preparing for the landing that they had neglected the possibility of something unusual taking place right in front of them.
The aforementioned experiments naturally beg the question: What distinguishes the people who saw the "gorilla" from those who didn't?
Contrary to popular belief, these experiments are not a measure of intelligence, ability, or personality.
Based on the results of the experiment, there was no concrete evidence supporting any correlation between noticing the gorilla and the participants' IQ, educational background, gender, or occupation.
Anyone is equally likely to miss it.
Even though some people saw it, it doesn't mean they don't sometimes miss other "gorillas."
The "illusion of attention" teaches us to be wary of our everyday perception.
Recognizing the potential discrepancy between what we think we see and what is actually there is the first step in making better decisions.
If we do our best to look for the invisible gorillas around us, we may be surprised at what we find.
Who knows?
Maybe there is some unexpected object right in front of you now that you have not even noticed!
