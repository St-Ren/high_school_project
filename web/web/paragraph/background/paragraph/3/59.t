A Small Town With Great Charm.
Tamsui, a small town situated where the Tamsui River flows peacefully into the ocean, just across the river from Mount Guanyin, is one of Taiwans unique cultural treasures.
Like Venice and many other towns and cities with rivers running through them, Tamsui is picturesque and has a cozy atmosphere.
Visitors enjoy the views and the tranquil breeze near the river.
In addition to its lovely scenery, Tamsui contains many significant historical sites because of its long colonial and multicultural past.
Hence, a visit to this attractive little town not only provides a chance to escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life, but also allows ones imagination to wander back in time.
The name Tamsui derives from the Tamsui River, yet in the early years the town was called Huwei by the locals, meaning the end of the fish traps. In fact, centuries ago there were quite a few fish traps, made by piling stones along the northern coast of Taiwan.
With the rise and fall of the tides, fish would end up in the traps.
Through this primitive fishing method, people in the area lived a self-sufficient life.
Not until Westerners arrived in the sixteenth century did the local way of life change.
Due to its advantageous geographical location, this small fishing village became a much-desired port, which was occupied and ruled by the Spanish and later the Dutch.
Finally, Taiwanese rule was restored in 1661 by an eminent general, Cheng Cheng-Kung.
Then, starting in the 1870s, the town was modernized as a consequence of the arrival of a Canadian missionary, Dr. George Leslie Mackay.
Before long, Tamsui had become an international port, but the gradual accumulation of sand and dirt in the river caused it to revert to a small fishing town.
Nowadays, with the expansion of Taipei City, this old port has regained its fame as one of the major tourist attractions in northern Taiwan.
No trip to Tamsui is complete without a stroll through its historical sites, many of which bear witness to the influence of a multicultural, colonial past and boast a unique blend of Western and Eastern styles.
One of the most distinctive examples of this is the renowned Fort San Domingo, or Hong-Mao Cheng.
Following its Chinesestyle main entrance, a garden path leads visitors to the main fort building, a square tower with an outer wall of red bricks, while just to the east of the fort lies the Former British Consulate, a fine Victorian-style brick building.
Another example from Tamsuis colonial past is the Tamsui Oxford Museum.
Originally called Oxford College, it was founded by Dr. Mackay.
The buildings red bricks and tile roof display a traditional Chinese style, while the dormer windows and arched shades are Western in design.
Interestingly enough, on the roof are pagodas and a cross standing side by side in perfect harmony.
After a nostalgic exploration of Tamsuis historical sites, visitors can jump back into the present to enjoy this small Taiwanese town as it is today.
Awaiting them are alluring scenic spots along the water as well as a tempting feast of local specialties.
But dusk is the time when Tamsui really comes alive.
The Tamsui Old Street and waterfront boardwalk are always loaded with food stands selling
crispy fish sticks, giant ice-cream cones, iron eggs, and A-Gei.
Along the narrow alleys are many little shops as well, where cheap clothes, handicrafts, and souvenirs can be found.
Visitors can also take a short ferry ride across the river to Bali or along the coast to Fishermans Wharf.
Both piers offer grand boardwalks, along which people of all ages can walk or ride bikes, savor the splendid sights, relax, and sample fresh seafood or sip hot coffee.
These two places are favorites with couples and lovers, who stroll arm in arm admiring the sunset before having a romantic dinner.
Visiting Tamsui is like taking a brief look at the four-hundredyear history of Taiwan.
Not only can visitors get a sense of what the town was like in past centuries, but they will also be able to appreciate the importance of maintaining its historical treasures.
Wandering around Tamsui, visitors will see that the town has evolved and developed, while still keeping much of its rich history, multicultural spirit, and ageless natural beauty.
