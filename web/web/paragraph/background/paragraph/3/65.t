Pride and Prejudice.
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife. So begins Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice, a novel which, although not published until 1813, opens up for us the world of late eighteenth century England.
Set in the English countryside roughly thirty miles from London, the novel starts with Mrs. Bennet informing her husband, Mr. Bennet, that the wealthy Bingley family is moving into their neighborhood, Netherfield Park.
Mrs. Bennet, whose main purpose in life is to get her daughters married, prompts her husband to pay a visit to the Bingleys, and a few days later Mr. Bingley visits the Bennets with his two sisters and his friend Mr. Darcy.
Later, at a party, the gentlemanly Mr. Bingley becomes very interested in Jane, the oldest of the five Bennet sisters, while Darcy, less socially adept, more proud, and more rude, immediately begins insulting the Bennets second daughter, Elizabeth.
When Bingley suggests that he ask her to dance, Darcy says that he finds Elizabeth only tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me. However, he subsequently begins to realize that she is after all rather attractive and uncommonly intelligent, and he wishes to get to know her better, but she refuses him because of his earlier insults.
In the meantime, the relationship between Jane and Bingley keeps developing, as Bingley finds Jane goodtempered and amiable.
Jane becomes ill after riding one rainy day to the Bingleys on horseback.
Forced to stay at the Bingleys for several days, Jane invites Elizabeth to join her.
Elizabeth now has to confront Darcy repeatedly.
When he invites her to dance, she replies coldly and ironically: You wanted me, I know, to say Yes, that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kinds of schemes.
I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all. But Darcy is increasingly charmed by Elizabeths quick wit and her frankness in conversation, as opposed to the pretty words of other women.
Jane recovers and falls in love with Bingley, while Elizabeth becomes more curious about Darcy.
One day, a military officer, Mr. Wickham, meets Elizabeth and accuses Darcy of, in effect, stealing his money, adding that pride had often been his best friend. Shocked, Elizabeth now thinks Darcy is malicious and dishonest.
She then learns that Bingley may abandon Jane and marry Darcys sister.
One day, while visiting her friend Charlotte, Elizabeth comes across Darcy and his snobbish aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
Days later, Darcy boldly proposes marriage to Elizabeth, saying, You must allow me to say how ardently I admire and love you.
Elizabeth, of course, refuses, still assuming that Darcy has convinced Bingley not to marry Jane, and that he has wrongly kept a large sum of money.
Yet the very next day, Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter explaining why he has warned Bingley not to marry Jane and how Wickham has lied about the money.
Elizabeth now begins to believe him, and she feels ashamed of her failure to see the true natures of Darcy and Wickham.
When the latter runs off with Elizabeths younger sister Lydia, Darcy enables them to marry by paying off Wickhams debts, further endearing him to Elizabeth.
And then everything ends well.
After Lydia marries Wickham, Bingley decides he does love Jane after all and they too get married.
Jane now says she is the most fortunate creature that ever existed. As for Elizabeth and Darcy, they are clearly very much in love and finally become engaged.
Mrs. Bennet is ecstatic about the fact that she will have rich sons-in-lawXfor while upperclass gentlemen may have been looking for suitable wives, the not-so-rich parents of well-educated, middle-class women were also eager to catch some of these eligible bachelors.
Like Jane Austen herself, late eighteenth century Englishwomen who were able to elevate their status and the quality of their lives by marrying a gentleman had to be clever and to possess good social skills.
In fact, Austens young female protagonists, modeled after her, are smarter than most of the men they meet, and we see characters like Elizabeth Bennet sharply criticizing the men with their subtle wit and biting ironies.
Therefore, when reading a Jane Austen novel you may sometimes feel that a twenty-first-century woman has gone back to 1790s England in a time machine, where she now finds herself talking to these fancily dressed, too-proud, too-polite English gentlemen, for the author was way ahead of her time.
This helps to explain why the novels, which indirectly promote womens rights, are still so enormously popular today.
