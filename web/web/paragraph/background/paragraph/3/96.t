That, my friends, is globalization!
This scenario vividly describes globalization, one of the most widely used terms at the end of the 20th century.
However, more and more scholars have started to question the accepted benefits of the system as it has affected the world.
Many people regard globalization as a process of market integration.
This process enables individuals, corporations, or nations to reach the world farther, faster, deeper, and even cheaper than before.
In contrast, some scholars view globalization as a deliberate project that subjects nations and individuals to more powerful market forces, which are not always positive.
This very basic difference in perspective shows just how significant the debate over globalization is to countries all over the world.
Globalization used to be widely celebrated as the birth of freedom for peoples all over the world.
It was seen as a positive force creating better connections in a more open world.
Barriers to trade were broken down and tensions among regions were resolved.
Many leaders, especially those in the West, supported the beginning of a new world order through free trade and political cooperation.
By the late 1990s, however, the feelings were no longer the same as before.
The term globalization was used increasingly to express concern about the results of global change on the well-being of various groups, the identity of nations, and the health of the environment.
Politicians in various countries came to oppose Americas global influence brought by global capitalism as it dominated markets economically, culturally, and socially.
Globalization has thus become an issue of a heated global debate.
A standard complaint about globalization is that cultural diversity is disappearing because interaction and integration diminish differences.
Gradually, a so-called global norm comes into existence and replaces the original local color.
For example, the United States is building a cultural empire with the global extension of American symbols and popular culture.
On the other hand, it can be argued that new diversity can result from globalization because interaction is likely to lead to new forms of culture and integration is likely to remind people of the value of their own traditions.
Global norms are interpreted differently according to local sensibilities, and one such norm stresses the value of cultural difference itself.
According to this line of thought, America has no total control of the rest of the world and other nations do not necessarily need to buy whatever it sells.
According to one argument, globalization slows down the development of individual nations enterprise systems: free trade limits a nations ability to set policy to protect local companies.
Fewer and fewer nations can resist the power of global norms.
However, some suggest that in a more integrated world, a nation may even become more important because it can have a special role in creating conditions for growth and compensating for the effects of economic competition.
They are key players in organizations and treaties that address global problems.
Scholars have different views on the pros and cons of globalization.
While whether we should welcome or dread globalization is a debatable topic, one thing for certain is that we are all part of this global phenomenon and deeply affected by it.
