Unit 12  A Lesson in CommunicationXand a Taste of Drama.
Time: Evening.
Place: The living room of an ordinary apartment.
The Gao family is relaxing after supper.
Mr. Gao: (casually) So whats new in school, Ping?
Ping: (shrugs) Nothing muchXexcept that we have been guiding the juniors through a drama contest.
Mrs. Gao: (interested) A drama contest?
Wow, that should be fun!
Mr. Gao: Yeah.
(winking at Mrs. Gao) Your mom starred in an English play while she was in college.
Ping: (interested) Really, Mom?
What was the play?
Mrs. Gao: (a bit shy) Aw, that was a long time ago.
(lost in memory) But I still remember the play vividly.
Its called The Glass Menagerie.
Ping: The Glass Menagerie?
What a weird title!
Mrs. Gao: Sounds strange, doesnt it?
Its the play that made Tennessee Williams famous, though.
Ping: Tennessee Williams?
Mr. Gao: Well, Im not surprised that youve never heard of him.
He was born almost a century agoX
Mrs. Gao: (smiling) He was born in 1911 and died in 1983.
Mr. Gao: (a bit surprised) Wow, you have a good memory indeed!
Mrs. Gao: And Tennessee Williams is one of the most important playwrights in American theater.
Ping: (genuinely interested) Really?
Maybe we can recommend this play to the juniors.
Mrs. Gao: Hmm, Im not so sure about that.
It is rather a sad story.
Whats more, there actually arent that many characters in the play.
Ping: What is the play about?
Mrs. Gao: Well, its a long story, Ping, but Ill try to make it short.
Born slightly disabled, Laura is an extremely shy and quiet girl.
She lives with her mother, Amanda, and her brother, Tom, but she keeps herself in her own small world of a glass menagerieX
Mr. Gao: (interrupting) That is, a collection of animals made out of glass.
Mrs. Gao: Yes.
Concerned about Lauras future, Amanda talks Tom into inviting his friends over, so that Laura can find someone to marry.
(after a short pause) The gentleman callers, as they are called.
Ping: Ah, I know.
Tom the matchmaker finds a perfect man for his sister, and they live happily ever after.
Mrs. Gao: Not so fast, young lady!
(half seriously) And dont interrupt if you want to hear the story.
Ping: (jokingly) Yes, maam!
Mrs. Gao: One day, Tom brings his best friend Jim home for dinner, and much to Amandas delightX
Mr. Gao: (chiming in) But Laura is frightened out of her wits, for this gentleman caller happens to be her high school idol.
Ping: Ah, I would be scared to death, too, if I were Laura!
(catches herself) Sorry, Mom, I didnt mean to interrupt.
Please go on.
(cant help herself) Do they fall in love?
Mrs. Gao: Thats the sad part of it.
Just after Jim is able to restore some self-confidence in Laura, he tells her that he is already engaged to another girl .
Ping: Oh, no .
(Silence follows.)
Mr. Gao: It doesnt have the kind of happy ending that many people expect of a love story.
It is a stirring play.
Ping: Which role did you play, Mom?
Did you play Laura?
Mr. Gao: (nodding) You guessed right, smart girl!
Ping: Did you hate Jim, Mom, when he told you he was getting married?
Mrs. Gao: Hate him?
(winks at Mr. Gao) Of course not!
As Laura, I was disappointed, to be sureXvery disappointed, I should say.
But why would I hate him?
It was just a misunderstanding.
Mr. Gao: Right.
I mean, Tom doesnt know that Jim already has a steady relationship with another girl, let alone that they are getting married soon.
Mrs. Gao: In fact, in my role of Laura, I was very grateful to Jim for instilling some confidence into meXeven though it was for just a short while.
Ping: (puzzled) I dont understand .
Mr. Gao: Let me show you how Jim is able to help Laura overcome her initial shyness and become as eloquent and self-confident as she has never been, perhaps in her entire life.
(He gets up and picks up a book from the bookshelf.)
(Light dims downstage, revealing Jim and Laura, upstage, in an American living room of the 1930s.)
[Excerpted from The Glass Menagerie, Scene VII]
Jim: Everybody excels in some one thing.
Some in many!
(unconsciously glancing at himself in the mirror) All youve got to do is discover in what!
Take me, for instance.
(He adjusts his tie at the mirror.)
My interest happens to lie in electrodynamics.
Im taking a course in radio engineering at night school, Laura, on top of a fairly responsible job at the warehouse.
Im taking that course and studying public speaking.
Laura: Ohhhh.
Jim: Because I believe in the future of television!
(turning his back to her) I wish to be ready to go up right along with it.
Therefore, Im planning to get in on the ground floor.
In fact Ive already made the right connections, and all that remains is for the industry itself to get under way!
Full steamX(His eyes are starry.)
KnowledgeXZzzzzp!
MoneyXZzzzzp!XPower!
Thats the cycle democracy is built on!
(His attitude is convincingly dynamic.
Laura stares at him, even her shyness eclipsed in her absolute wonder.
He suddenly grins.)
I guess you think I think a lot of myself!
Laura: NoXo-o-o, IX
Jim: Now how about you?
Isnt there something you take more interest in than anything else?
Laura: Well, I doXas I saidXhave myXglass collectionX
Jim: Im not right sure I know what youre talking about.
Laura: Little articles of it, theyre ornaments mostly!
Most of them are little animals made out of glass, the tiniest little animals in the world.
Mother calls them a glass menagerie!
Heres an example of one, if youd like to see it!
This one is one of the oldest.
Its nearly thirteen.
(Jim stretches out his hand.)
Oh, be carefulXif you breathe, it breaks!
Jim: Id better not take it.
Im pretty clumsy with things.
Laura: Go on, I trust you with him!
(Places it in his palm.)
There nowXyoure holding him gently!
Hold him over the lightXhe loves the light!
You see how the light shines through him?
Jim: It sure does shine!
Laura: I shouldnt be partial, but he is my favorite one.
Jim: What kind of a thing is this one supposed to be?
Laura: Havent you noticed the single horn on his forehead?
Jim: A unicorn, huh?
Laura: Mm-hmmm!
Jim: Unicorns, arent they extinct in the modern world?
Laura: I know!
Jim: Poor little fellow, he must feel sort of lonesome.
Laura: Well, if he were to be able to talk, he would not complain about it.
He stays on a shelf with some horses that dont have horns, and all of them seem to get along nicely together.
Jim: How do you know?
Laura: I havent heard any arguments among them!
(Light dims upstage, revealing the Gao family downstage.)
Ping: Bravo!
(They all applaud.)
Mr. Gao: Isnt it great the way Jim leads Laura to overcome her nervousness to express herself?
Mrs. Gao: Yes, very gently and skillfully he makes Laura talk about the subject she is familiar withXher collection of animals, the glass menagerie.
Ping: Indeed.
I saw her face brighten up gradually until she seems very much at ease.
Shes even humorous toward the end!
Mr. Gao: Yes.
Its a good lesson in communication for all of us.
Mrs. Gao: And guess who played Jim?
(Mr. and Mrs. Gao look at each other and burst into laughter that they try unsuccessfully to suppress.)
Ping: (unbelievable) It cant be you, can it, Dad?
(Light dims as the laughter continues.)
