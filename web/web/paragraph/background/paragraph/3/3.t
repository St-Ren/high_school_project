The Delights of Books.
Books are to mankind what memory is to the individual.
They contain the history of our race, the discoveries we have made, the accumulated knowledge and experience of ages; they picture for us the marvels and beauties of nature, help us in our difficulties, comfort us in sorrow and in suffering, change hours of weariness into moments of delight, store our minds with ideas, fill them with good and happy thoughts, and lift us out of and above ourselves.

Whether sixty or sixteen, there is in every human beings heart the love of wonder, the sweet amazement of the stars and the star-like things, the undaunted challenge of events, the unfailing child-like appetite for what comes next, and the joy of the game of living.
