Cleanliness is commonly considered a virtue, but just what does it mean to be clean?
One person's definition can be quite different from another's, but cleanliness basically means being free of dirt and germs.
Bathing, in particular, is considered one of the simplest ways to achieve cleanliness.
Throughout the ages, our perception of bathing as well as our bathing habits has undergone huge changes.
Sometimes bathing is popular; sometimes it's not.
Influenced greatly by religion, economy and technology, bathing has certainly come a long way to become what we are used to today.
Archaeological evidence suggests that bathing is as old as the first civilizations.
A soap-like material, which dates back to about 2 B.C., has been found in clay jars of Babylonian origin.
It was a mix of fats and ashes.
But no one in history has indulged in bathing like the Romans did.
Supplied with water from the aqueducts, nearly a dozen large and magnificent public bathhouses dotted the city of Rome.
Hundreds more have been found in the Roman manors.
The Romans took bathing more as a leisure-time sport than a hygienic practice.
First, a bather would enter a warm room to sweat while enjoying lengthy conversations.
Oil and sand would be rubbed against the skin to cleanse it.
Next came a hot room where the heavily perspiring bather would be treated to water-splashing, more oil and scraping, and yet more talk.
The final touch would be a plunge into a cool and refreshing pool.
In the early years of bathing in Rome, men and women had separate areas, but eventually the sexes were combined and the baths took on a less virtuous purpose.
So corrupt had the Roman baths and the whole Roman society become that the fathers of the early Christian church discouraged bathing.
Clergymen all over Europe frowned on bathing because they disapproved of nakedness; the public baths were considered centers of immorality and thus outlawed in many localities.
As a result, to such an extent were people's hygienic practices repressed that Europe during the Middle Ages has been said to have gone through "a thousand years without a bath."
Queen Isabella of Castile boasted that she had bathed only twice in her life-at birth and before her marriage.
Religion, however, wasn't the only reason why Europeans didn't bathe.
Because the rivers were polluted, there was no running water, and the soap was taxed as a luxury item, the ordinary citizen had little opportunity to bathe.
There was also the misconception among doctors that bathing in warm or hot water would open one's pores to diseases.
Little did they know that it was, in fact, people's poor bathing habits and unsanitary living conditions that largely contributed to the great plagues of the Middle Ages.
For the next few hundred years, people continued to live without any bathing facilities.
Early Americans, being of European origin, also brought their dirty habits with them.
By the 1s, it became increasingly known that filth led to diseases, and scholars began to argue that frequent bathing led to better health.
As a result, both Europeans and Americans began reforming their unhygienic ways.
Governments began to improve sanitation standards and many bathhouses were built as a result.
Later, tubs, water heaters and good indoor plumbing made bathing accessible to ordinary citizens.
Now most people bathe on a daily basis, and Americans like it so much that the average person in the USA claims to shower or bathe more than once each day.
Looking back in history, we can see that there have been very different views of bathing, and that cleanliness has not always been the top priority as it is nowadays.
It seems natural or even vital for us to shower daily.
Nevertheless, could it be possible that, in five hundred years, our current bathing habits may appear overly fastidious?
Whether we bathe twice a day or twice in our entire life, people's bathing habits will surely undergo more changes in the years to come.
