This is the text of a commencement address by Steve Jobs, former CEO of Apple Computer and of Pixar Animation Studios, delivered at Stanford University on June 12, 2005.
I am honored to be with you today.
Today I want to tell you three stories from my life.
That's it.
No big deal.
Just three stories.
The first story is about connecting the dots.
I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
So why did I drop out?
When I was 17, I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' money was being spent on my college tuition.
I couldn't see the value in it.
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay.
It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back, I think it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
It wasn't all romantic.
But much of what I found by accident with my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.
Let me give you one example:
Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction around.
Because I had dropped out, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to create beautiful and artistic handwriting.
I learned about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations and what makes letters in text look great.
 But it seemed as though none of this had even a hope
of any practical application in my life.
But ten years later,
when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, we
designed it all into the Mac.
If I had never dropped out,
I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,
and the Mac would have never had many typefaces,
and personal computers might not be able to create
the wonderful fonts that they do today.
it was impossible to connect the dots looking
forward when I was in college.
But it was very,
very clear looking back ten years later.
My second story is about love and loss.
Woz and I started Apple in my parent's garage when I was 20.
In ten years, Apple had grown into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees.
But just as I turned thirty, I got fired.
How can you get fired from a company you started?
Well, as our visions of the future began to diverge, our Board of Directors eventually sided with the others.
So at 30 I was out, very publicly out.
What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone.
I had been rejected, but I was still in love.
And so I decided to start over.
 I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again.
It freed me to enter one of the most creative hours of my life.
During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, and another company Pixar.
Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated film, "Toy Story," and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.
In an amazing turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, and I returned to Apple.
Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick.
Don't lose faith.
I'm totally sure that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.
You've got to find what you love.
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.
Don't settle.
My third story is about death.
When I was 17, I read this: "If you live each day as if it were your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."
It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've known to help me make the big choices in life.
Because almost everythingall expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failurethese things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
You are already naked.
There is no reason not to follow your heart.
About a year ago, one morning, I was diagnosed with cancer.
The doctors told me it was almost certainly a deadly type of cancer, and advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which
is doctor's code for preparing to die.
I lived with
that diagnosis all day.
Later that evening, when
the doctors viewed the cells under
a microscope, they started crying
because it turned out to be a
very rare form of cancer
that is curable with
surgery and I'm
This was the closest I've been to facing death.
No one wants to die.
Yet death is the destination we all share.
No one has ever escaped it.
It is life's change agent.
It clears out the old to make way for the new.
Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
Don't be trapped by others' beliefs, which is living with the results of other people's thinking.
Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice, and most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
 "Stay hungry, stay foolish."
That's what I have always wished for myself.
And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.
Stay hungry.
Stay foolish.
