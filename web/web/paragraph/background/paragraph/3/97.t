As members of the global village, we have to face this very serious issue: environmental protection.
The following are f?ive things that we need to do today.
Even the cleanest countries have serious environmental problems.
Finland wins high marks for air and water quality, a low incidence of infant disease, and the measures it takes to protect its citizens from water pollution and natural disasters.
But the country also produces an above-average amount of greenhouse gases, uses a massive amount of land and water to sustain the national level of consumption, and contributes signif?icantly to regional environmental problems.
To get greener, countries must do more to take advantage of national strengths.
Finland, among the worlds largest exporters of wind-power technology, produces less than 1 percent of its own electricity through wind power.
It is about time that Finland made better use of its wind-power technology for the countrys electricity supply.
On June 22, 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, caught fire.
No one was hurt, and the f?ire caused only about $50,000 worth of property damage.
Still, polluted water in the river had a huge impact, focusing attention on environmental issues in the United States.
Three years later, the Clean Water Act was enacted, and in time, other aggressive steps were taken to improve the quality of the countrys air and water.
Today, people fish and canoe on big stretches of the Cuyahoga.
To fight air pollution, the U.S. Congress boosted the average fuel economy standard for passenger cars from 18 mpg to 27.5 mpg between 1978 and 1985.
It hasnt risen since.
Thats likely to change, but Congress should do more to improve energy eff?iciency, such as offering greater incentives to own alternative-fuel vehicles.
In developed nations, people tend to live in cities and suburbs, concentrating pollution in those areas.
When rural swaths are publicly owned and protected against development, they become green moats that stop the harmful effects of brown cities. Canada exemplif?ies this.
While wild forests are largely disappearing in most developed nations, they still thrive in Canada.
Their presence helps explain why the country rates well overall for clean water and air, despite having a densely populated southern tier where cities like Montreal contribute to sulfur dioxide emissions that are nearly double the average in similar countries.
Other countries should follow Canadas lead and preserve their unspoiled wilderness.
Doing so will help make up for the harmful effects of urban pollution.
Its a fact that people living in affluent countries tend to be better educated, enjoy a higher standard of living, live longer lives, and have a brighter future.
Unfortunately, their material wealth results in a larger carbon footprint.
Happily, their affluence and education makes people who live in these countries more likely to be aware and active when it comes to doing something about that footprint.
It is in the interest of all countries for each one of them to gear public policy toward developing an informed citizenry.
The goal should be an engaged, educated public that can act as a powerful solution to environmental destruction.
How great is the potential environmental impact of China on the rest of the world?
Consider: If its car-ownership rate matched that of the United States, one billion cars would be on Chinas roads.
That would mean total gas consumption of 520 billion gallons per yearwnearly half the current world use.
Fortunately, there are signs the Chinese government is taking environmental problems seriously.
China has announced a number of ambitious green goals, including cutting the use of coal in half, eliminating 200 manufacturing plants in the Beijing suburbs and lowering sulfur levels in gasoline.
Global environmental management requires global cooperation.
That means Western nations need to move more quickly in sharing with China emerging technologies that can be used to develop clean, alternative energy.
