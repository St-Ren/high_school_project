Sometimes it may seem that few surprises are left for travelers.
We seem to have already seen everything everywhere.
But there is still at least one place where few tourists go-Madagascar, an outlying island of great beauty and diversity off the coast of Africa.
A French colony since 1, Madagascar gained independence as the Malagasy Republic in 1, and was renamed Madagascar in 1.
Located in the Indian Ocean off the southeast coast of Africa, Madagascar is the fourth biggest island in the world, and its area is slightly bigger than that of its former colonial ruler.
People first arrived there about 2, years ago.
They traveled by canoe from places like India, Indonesia, Africa, and Arabia.
Chinese groups came rather late, around the end of the 1th century.
But there were traces of Chinese people as early as the early 1th century.
Legend has it that the Chinese explorer Zheng He from the Ming Dynasty traveled to this land.
It is even said that some Chinese Madagascan families are descended from Zheng's mariners!
While Madagascar has great ethnic diversity, its residents today exist as one culture.
Scientists sometimes call Madagascar the eighth continent.
This is because a large portion of the animal and plant life here can't be found anywhere else.
For example, the cat-like fossa is a rare animal.
There are as few as 2, fossas left even in Madagascar.
This massive island is also home to nine-tenths of the world's lemurs, a monkey-like mammal.
Some larger species can jump over nine meters from branch to branch, while smaller species are only the size of a mouse.
Above Madagascar's rain forests fly roller birds.
They have green heads and white chins.
Their bodies are green and blue, and their wings purple, like paintings that have come alive.
Over 1, kinds of orchids thrive along the forest floor, and the rarest of all has beautiful white petals.
The forests are also home to Madagascar hissing cockroaches.
These special bugs are named for the distinctive sound they make.
It is thought that no other roaches in the world are capable of making a sound like this.
Aside from the natural outlook, tombs for the burial of the dead can also be seen all over the island.
The deceased are sometimes described as "gods on earth" and are commonly perceived as the mediums between a supreme God and humankind.
They are thought to be able to influence the fate of their living descendants.
People treasure their close ties with the deceased, and the privileged position of the dead is evident in the beautiful tombs.
These are built with great care and expense, and are often much sturdier and more costly than houses built for the living.
The tombs around Madagascar vary in form; some are solid stone structures, while others are made of concrete with glass windows and decorations.
No matter what kind of tomb they build, the builders' common purpose is to preserve their bonds with the dead.
Because of Madagascar's unique sights and traditions, a traveler in search of some unconventional fun may find it fascinating.
Next time you want to go to someplace exotic, try Madagascar, a land full of surprises!
