Unit 5 Death by Tourism.
At the entrance to one of the ancient temples of Petra in Jordan, there is an inscription carved deeply into the soft red rock.
It looks as if it has been there for centuries.
It could have been written by one of King Herods soldiers, when they were imprisoned in this town in 37 B.C.
But closer inspection reveals that it is not so ancient after all.
Shane and Wendy from Sydney were here.
April 16, 1996.
The ruins of Petra were discovered in 1812, but a recent report has concluded that they are in grave danger of being destroyed by the unstoppable march of tourism. More than 4,000 tourists a day tramp through Petras rocky tombs, wearing away the soft red sandstone, and gradually turning it into a powder.
Some thoughtless visitors have so little reverence for this sacred place that they think nothing of scratching their names on the rock there.
However, it is not just Petra that is under threat of destruction.
More than 600 million tourists a year now travel the globe, and, understandably, vast numbers of them want to visit the worlds most treasured sites, such as Indias Taj Mahal, Englands Stonehenge, and the national parks of Kenya.
Many destinations that were once too remote to visit are now just a flight or bus trip away, and many have become part of inexpensive package tours.
Because of the tourist industry, these sites are now being visited by millions of people annually.
In addition to the above tourist attractions, tourists are flocking to the neighborhood of the Mediterranean Sea, too.
The population of 130 million there can swell to 230 million each summer.
The once splendid and untouched landscape there now consists of mile after mile of hotels.
Yet, this current rate of visitors to the Mediterranean is nothing compared to a disturbing projection made by the United NationsXthe Mediterranean region could host 760 million holidaymakers by the year of 2025.
In Spain, France, Italy, and most of Greece, there is very little undeveloped coastline left, and the Mediterranean Sea has become the most contaminated sea in the whole world.
To make matters worse, sightseers are causing serious damage to historic sites just by visiting them.
Their sightseeing is actually destroying the very things that they want to see.
For instance, 7,000 visitors an hour trample in and out of Notre Dame Cathedral each day.
On a typical day, thirty-five buses, having let their passengers out, wait outside, with the fumes from their engines continuously eating away the delicate stonework of the monument.
Not all of the news is gloomy, however.
Governments are now becoming more aware of the deterioration of these valuable areas and sites, and they are taking action.
For example, in Taiwan, the Fushan Botanical Garden has been established to protect part of the islands natural environment.
Different from scenic spots, this reservation shields the areas natural life by strictly limiting the number of visitors to just 600 during the weekends and requiring visitors to apply in advance for a special entry permit.
Additionally, many areas of the park are off-limits to tourists, which means that a lot of wildlife is left undisturbed.
Moreover, an education center has been built to teach visitors to have an enhanced respect for the natural environment.
These measures have led to an increase in the number of plants and animals in and around the reservation.
It used to be unquestioned that travel broadens the mind, but how can this possibly be true when the explosive growth of tourism eventually would leave nothing but ruins for the visitors to see?
If uncontrolled, tourism will continue to take its toll on our cultural and natural treasures, and these things cannot be restored once they have been spoiled.
To cushion these places from greater damage, governments should set up clear guiding principles to encourage more public participation in environmental conservation.
As for tourists, they should adopt a stronger sense of responsibility and morality.
After all, visiting amazing places around the world should be a privilege, rather than something that is taken for granted.
