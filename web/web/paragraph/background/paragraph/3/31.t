The inexplicable have always been a charm to the human mind.
There are ancient myths, legends, and mysteries in history that were beyond human understanding.
The curse of Tutankhamun is one of the most famous mysteries in the early 2th century.
The boy king ruled Egypt for nine years before dying mysteriously at the age of nineteen.
It was said that the pharaoh was assassinated and that all records of his existence were wiped out, and there was no trace of his tomb until 3, years later.
But once his tomb was discovered, a series of inexplicable deaths and events followed.
They made people notice the curse of Tutankhamun, a spell that anyone who dared to disturb the peace of the dead would be doomed.
In 1, when a search team led by Howard Carter opened the tomb of Tutankhamun, they were ecstatic.
Little did they know then that this act would seal the fates of many.
Immediately after the opening of the tomb, the canary Carter kept in his home was swallowed by a cobra, the symbol of Egyptian monarchy.
A few weeks later, Lord Carnarvon, who had financed the digging, died of infection due to a mosquito bite.
What was even more hair-raising was that the mosquito bite on Carnarvon's cheek was in the same position where the mummified face of the pharaoh had a distinguishable mark.
Then, moments before Carnarvon died, the city of Cairo was plunged into darkness as all the lights went out.
Other unnatural deaths followed.
An archeologist on the team suddenly went into a coma and died.
Carnarvon's friend died of fever after visiting the tomb.
The researcher studying the mummified figure of Tutankhamun also died under mysterious circumstances soon afterwards.
This series of misfortunes made many people believe that the tomb of Tutankhamun was indeed cursed.
A newspaper report mentioned that a curse was found written on the inside of the sarcophagus: "Death shall come on swift wings to him who disturbs the peace of the King."
Although this writing was nowhere to be found later on, the idea of a curse began to take shape.
Many people were convinced that the unnatural deaths were a clear sign that the wheels of fate had started rolling for those who had dared to open the tomb.
On the other hand, many skeptics have pointed out that the deaths could be the result of a deadly fungus growing in the enclosed tomb.
Recent studies have shown that high-level toxic gases are present inside similar tombs.
These could have poisoned those who entered the tomb.
Some also claim that the idea of a curse could well have been fueled by the media.
In order to boost sales, all that the media needed to do was spread a fitting rumor.
The fact is that only six members of the original team died within the first decade of the discovery.
Howard Carter, the man responsible for the find, lived another seventeen years and died a natural death.
Carnarvon's daughter, one of the first to enter the tomb, lived to the ripe old age of eighty.
The team's photographer, the researcher who had studied the inscriptions, and many others lived for more than two decades after the opening of the tomb.
Although there are many explanations, none of them is definitive.
We may choose to believe the curse or provide our own explanations based on the evidence gathered, but the mystery around Pharaoh Tutankhamun will remain.
