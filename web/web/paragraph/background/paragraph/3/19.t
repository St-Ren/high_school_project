I Want a Wife.
The following essay quickly became a classic piece of feminist humor when it appeared in the premiere issue of Ms. magazine.
It has been widely circulated 2, reprinted, and discussed many times since then.
The writer, Judy Brady, points out in her essay just how convenient it is to have a wife.
A wife, after all, is someone who will take care of your children, cook your food, clean and mend your clothes, entertain your friends, and so on.
Certainly, anyone would want to have a wife.
The only trouble is, who would want to be a wife?
I belong to that classification of people known as wives.
I am a Wife.
And, not altogether incidentally, I am a mother.
Not too long ago a male friend of mine appeared on the scene fresh from a recent divorce.
He had one child, who is, of course, with his ex-wife.
He is looking for another wife.
As I thought about him while I was ironing one evening, it suddenly occurred to me that I, too, would like to have a wife.
Why do I want a wife?
I would like to go back to school so that I can become economically independent, support myself, and, if need be, support those dependent upon me.
I want a wife who will work and send me to school.
And while I am going to school I want a wife to take care of my children.
I want a wife to keep track of the childrens doctor and dentist appointments.
And to keep track of mine, too.
I want a wife to make sure my children eat properly and are kept clean.
I want a wife who will wash the childrens clothes and keep them mended.
I want a wife who is a good nurturant attendant to my children, who arranges for their schooling, makes sure that they have an adequate social life with their peers, takes them to the park, the zoo, etc.
I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick, a wife who arranges to be around when the children need special care, because, of course, I cannot miss classes at school.
My wife must arrange to lose time at work, and not lose the job.
It may mean a small cut in my wifes income from time to time, but I guess I can tolerate that.
Needless to say, my wife will arrange and pay for the care of the children while my wife is working.
I want a wife who will take care of my physical needs.
I want a wife who will keep my house clean.
A wife who will pick up after my children, a wife who will pick up after me.
I want a wife who will keep my clothes clean, ironed, mended, replaced when need be, and who will see to it that my personal things are kept in their proper place so that I can find what I need the minute I need it.
I want a wife who cooks the meals, a wife who is a good cook.
I want a wife who will plan the meals, do the necessary grocery shopping, prepare the meals, serve them pleasantly, and then do the cleaning up while I do my studying.
I want a wife who will care for me when I am sick and sympathize with my pain and loss of time from school.
I want a wife to go along when our family takes a vacation so that someone can continue to care for me and my children when I need a rest and change of scene.
I want a wife who will not bother me with rambling complaints about a wifes duties.
But I want a wife who will listen to me when I feel the need to explain a rather difficult point I have come across in my course of studies.
And I want a wife who will type my papers for me when I have written them.
I want a wife who will take care of the details of my social life.
When my wife and I are invited out by my friends, I want a wife who will take care of the babysitting arrangements.
When I meet people at school that I like and want to entertain, I want a wife who will have the house clean, will prepare a special meal, serve it to me and my friends, and not interrupt when I talk about the things that interest me and my friends.
I want a wife who will have arranged that the children are fed and ready for bed before my guests arrive so that the children do not bother us.
I want a wife who takes care of the needs of my guests so that they feel comfortable, who makes sure that they have an ashtray, that they are passed the hors doeuvres, that they are offered a second helping of the food, that their wine glasses are replenished when necessary, that their coffee is served to them as they like it.
And I want a wife who knows that sometimes I need a night out by myself.
If, by chance, I find another person more suitable as a wife than the wife I already have, I want the liberty to replace my present wife with another one.
Naturally, I will expect a fresh, new life; my wife will take the children and be solely responsible for them so that I am left free.
When I am through with school and have a job, I want my wife to quit working and remain at home so that my wife can more fully and completely take care of a wifes duties.
My God, who wouldnt want a wife?
