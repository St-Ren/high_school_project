Two girls, Saree and Basimah, both immigrated to the United States from an Arabic country and entered the same school, North Sea Crest Academy.
They soon became good friends.
The girls spoke to each other in their native language, Arabic, to help themselves feel at home and to remember their heritage.
The two girls' behavior caused some trouble, and the principal decided to suspend them.
Therefore, the families of the two girls filed a lawsuit against North Sea Crest Academy for violation of their daughters' rights of free speech.
THE ISSUE:
Did North Sea Crest Academy, a public school, violate the rights of free speech by not allowing Saree and Basimah to speak Arabic at school?
I am a new student at North Sea Crest Academy.
My family immigrated to this country this summer.
I have only been here for a very short period of time.
My English is not that good so I was very happy to meet Basimah, a girl at my age who also speaks Arabic.
It is such a comfort to be with Basimah and I know she feels the same.
When we speak Arabic at school, many of the other students give us unfriendly stares and no one has tried to make friends with us.
In fact, some students, such as Sarah, even have taken things further.
They will do things like pushing us in the halls, making our books fall, and saying very mean things to us about our heritage.
When Basimah and I complained to the principal, Ms. Blake, about these things happening to us, she told us not to speak Arabic at school.
It was as if we were the problem.
We both told our parents and they agreed that we should continue to speak Arabic at school.
A week later, Basimah and I were speaking to each other in Arabic in the school cafeteria when Sarah began screaming horrible things at us and encouraging other students to join in.
I was so afraid.
So was Basimah.
Two teachers rushed us out of the cafeteria to Ms. Blake's office.
After hearing what had happened, Ms. Blake suspended Basimah and me from school.
Testimony of Samma
 My name is Samma and I am the mother of Saree.
Our family has just come to America and we are so happy to be here.
Recently my daughter has been very upset.
She told me how she has been bullied and harassed by a few girls in her class.
I asked my daughter why it
happened, and she told me it is because she speaks Arabic at school.
She said she has tried to seek help from the principal, Ms. Blake, but the only solution is to stop speaking Arabic.
I told my girl no one has the right to stop her from speaking Arabic and that she needn't care what others think about it.
After a few days, I was told by the principal that my girl was suspended from the Academy because she insisted on speaking Arabic with her friend.
I asked an attorney, and I was told that my girl could not be stopped from speaking Arabic at school.
Therefore, I am here to struggle for my daughter's rights.
Testimony of Emma Blake
I am the principal at North Sea Crest Academy.
I am in charge of the safety and well-being of the students.
I was the principal of the school when September 11 occurred.
Like the rest of America, our community was in shock.
Our school was especially affected by the terrible event as many of the children had parents working in New York City and a few students even lost family members.
We held many counseling sessions and also
educated the children about the threat of terrorism.
whole country became aware of terrorism.
New Jersey, every radio station and every television
channel talked about being alert and reporting
suspicious activities.
INSTRUCTIONS:
The plaintiffs must prove
that the school violated their
rights of free speech by not
allowing them to speak their native
language while at school and then
suspending the students when they did
speak in Arabic.
SUB-ISSUES:
Did the girls have a right to expect their speech to be protected by the school?
Once the girls disobeyed their principal, was it proper to suspend the girls from school?
Given the climate in New Jersey after 911, was it reasonable for Sarah to expect the school to protect them and put an end to Saree's and Basimah's "secret speech"?
Did Principal Emma Blake act properly on behalf of the school?
Should the girls be allowed to return to school and speak Arabic?
