The details of the heart, mind, and spirit of Nelson Mandela, the most prominent leader of the African National Congress, are revealed in his electric, three decade long relationship with his ex-wife, Winnie Madikizela.
Although their marriage ended in separation (April, 1992) and divorce  (March, 1996), reading Mandela's letters to Winnie while in jail gives us deep insight into what he had experienced as a husband and lover.

My dearest Winnie,
Your beautiful photo still stands about two feet above my left shoulder as I write this note.
I dust it carefully every morning, for to do so gives me the pleasant feeling that I'm caressing you as in the old days.
I even touch your nose with mine to recapture the electric current that used to flush through my blood whenever I did so.
Nolitha stands on the table directly opposite me.
How can my spirits ever be down when I enjoy the fond attentions of such wonderful ladies?

My dearest Winnie,
I have been fairly successful in putting on a mask behind which I have pined for the family, alone, never rushing for the post when it comes until somebody calls out my name.
I also never linger after visits although sometimes the urge to do so becomes quite terrible.
I am struggling to suppress my emotions as I write this letter.
I have received only one letter since you were detained, that one dated August 22.
You must have had a hard time there.
I do not know anything about family affairs, such as payment of rent, telephone bills, care of children and their expenses, whether you will get a job when released.
As long as I don't hear from you, I will remain worried and dry like a desert.
I recall the Karoo I crossed on several occasions .
I saw the desert again in Botswana on my way to and from South Africaendless pits of sand and not a drop of water.
I have not had a letter from you.
I feel dry like a desert.
Letters from you and the family are like the arrival of summer rains and spring that liven my life and make it enjoyable.
Whenever I write you, I feel that
inside physical warmth, which makes me forget all my problems.
I become full of love.

My dearest Winnie,
Our daughters raised in hardship are grown women today.
The first-born has her own house and is raising her family.
We couldn't fulfill our wishes, as we had planned, to have a baby boy.
I had hoped to build you a refuge, no matter how small, so that we would have a place for rest and sustenance before the arrival of the sad, dry days.
I fell down and couldn't do these things.
I am as one building castles in the air.

My dearest Winnie,
You looked really wonderful on 17/11, very much like the woman I married.
There was color in your face.
Gone was the irritated appearance and tired look in your eyes when you are under pressure of over-dieting.
As usual, I kept addressing you as Mum but my body kept telling me that a woman is sitting across this platform.
I felt like singing, even if just to say Hallelujah!
