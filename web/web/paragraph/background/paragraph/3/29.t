No one would mistake an elephant for another animal.
Even a young child can recognize an elephant with its fan-like ears, curved ivory tusks, and long flexible trunk.
As the largest animal on land, elephants are popular stars in zoos, circuses, and Hollywood movies.
But behind their enormous size hides a fascinating and mysterious world.
The ancestry of elephants dates back 3 million years, and it was likely that they lived an aquatic life.
According to a recent fossil study, ancient elephants might have used their trunks to breathe while swimming.
In fact, modern elephants still use their trunks as a snorkel when crossing a river.
Among the elephant's ancestors, the best-known are the now-extinct mammoths, which lived from around 4. million years ago to as recently as 4, years ago.
Nowadays, there are only three species of elephants left on earth - two species in Africa (the African forest elephant and the African savannah elephant) and one species in Asia (the Asian elephant or the Indian elephant).
The elephant's trunk is formed of an extremely long nose and upper lip.
It can pick up objects as tiny as a pea but is also strong enough to pull an entire tree out of the ground.
Elephants use their trunks not only for breathing and smelling, but also for feeding, drinking, touching, and even communicating.
The trunk is to an elephant what both hands and a nose combined are to a human being.
Though apparently simple-minded, elephants are in fact very intelligent and sensitive.
They have been found to use tools obtained from their natural environment.
For example, they know how to use sticks to scratch themselves.
They also have special ways of communicating with each other.
They can even feel vibrations from miles away with their sensitive feet.
And what's more surprising is that elephants have a good memory.
They even update their memory, and pass down what they have learned from generation to generation.
A study indicated that African elephants reacted with fear to the scent of clothes worn by the Maasai people, who are known to demonstrate their manly bravery by spearing elephants.
Like humans, elephants are highly sociable.
They migrate as a female-dominant family herd.
The males will leave their family herd and travel alone when approaching adulthood.
The herd is ruled by its oldest and the most experienced female member.
When she dies, one of her elder offspring takes the "throne."
It is this close relationship that allows elephants to acquire the knowledge needed for survival.
The life expectancy of elephants is similar to that of human beings.
However, the mother carries her unborn baby for the duration of 2 months, which is the longest for any mammal.
A newborn baby is about 1 meter high and may weigh up to 1 kilograms.
Several adult females, such as the baby's aunts or cousins, will usually pitch in to help during and after its birth.
They will take care of the baby until it grows up.
Distant relatives will travel long distances to visit the newborn to bestow their best wishes.
Similarly, when a family member dies, elephants will gather around, touch the body with their trunks, and make mournful sounds for days.
Despite their enormous size and strength, elephants are graceful creatures.
They look as meek as sheep, but have amazing intelligence and emotional responses.
Compared with the tiger or the lion, maybe the elephant better deserves the title "the King of Beasts."
