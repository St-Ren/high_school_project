One evening in London, the famous lawyer Mr. Utterson learned that a violent and malicious man named Edward Hyde had recently used a check that had been made out by Utterson's friend and client-the well-respected Dr. Henry Jekyll.
The news, combined with the fact that Jekyll's will had appointed Hyde as the beneficiary, raised Utterson's curiosity about Jekyll's relationship with a man of such questionable morals.
A year later, London was rocked by the news of the vicious murder of an elderly politician named Sir Danvers Carew.
A witness reported that the politician had been brutally beaten to death with a heavy cane by Mr. Hyde.
When the police showed Utterson the murder weapon, Utterson was alarmed to find that it was the exact same cane that he had given to Jekyll as a gift.
Concerned for his friend's reputation and safety, Utterson went to see Dr. Jekyll.
Jekyll reassured him that there was nothing to worry about by showing him a letter written by Hyde.
In it, the savage man apologized for his actions and promised Jekyll that he would not be heard from again.
Just when Utterson breathed a sigh of relief, however, his assistant pointed out that the handwriting was almost identical to Dr. Jekyll's.
The idea that Jekyll might be assisting Hyde left Utterson shocked.
Hoping to solve the mystery, Utterson paid a visit to their mutual friend Dr. Lanyon.
Lanyon, sick and distressed, didn't say anything about Jekyll.
Within two weeks he died of deteriorating health; he left behind a letter for Utterson with instructions telling him not to open it until the death or disappearance of Jekyll.
Months later, a servant of Dr. Jekyll's approached Utterson.
He said his master had isolated himself in his laboratory for weeks and that the voice now coming from behind the locked door sounded nothing like Dr. Jekyll's.
He asked, in desperation, for the lawyer to return with him to Jekyll's house.
With Utterson by his side, the servant broke into the doctor's laboratory.
But Jekyll was nowhere to be found.
Instead, the two men discovered the body of Edward Hyde on the floor, apparently a victim of suicide.
They also found a letter from Jekyll addressed to Utterson and a note urging him to first read Dr. Lanyon's letter.
Utterson hurried to his office to get the letter.
Lanyon wrote that he had once received a visit from a man called Edward Hyde.
The strange man, he wrote, then drank an unusual potion and changed into Henry Jekyll before his very eyes.
At that point, Utterson realized that Jekyll and Hyde were actually the same person and immediately opened Jekyll's letter.
Jekyll explained that he had always hidden the darker side of his character from the outside world.
Through his studies, he had found a way to separate the evil in himself from the rest of his personality.
By taking a special potion he could become a completely different man, namely, Edward Hyde.
And disguised in this manner, he was able to be free from the constraints of conscience, free to do whatever he pleased.
As time went on, however, he realized that he was losing control over these transformations and was sometimes turning into Hyde even without taking the potion.
Jekyll wrote that he knew he would soon become Mr. Hyde permanently and would never be able to change back again.
Upon this revelation, he knew that Hyde would face execution for his crimes or choose to commit suicide for fear of being apprehended.
Either way, Jekyll wrote, the world would never again see his face.
