Unit 8 Modern-Day Pirates.
Are there any pirates today?
Surprisingly, the answer is yes.
The romantic images many of us have in our minds of pirates wearing eye patches with parrots on their shoulders may be out-of-date, but each year hundreds of pirate attacks are committed on international shipping routes.
Most of the piracy undertaken today is extremely high-tech.
Pirates use sophisticated tools, like radar, to locate ships that are vulnerable to attack.
Smaller acts of piracy include boarding pleasure boats and stealing from them, often after murdering the owners and throwing their corpses into the water.
Larger thefts include diverting entire tankers into a secret port, where oil or other precious commodities are unloaded and later sold.
Using other kinds of technology, law enforcement officials are finding ways to stop piracy or at least catch pirates in the act.
For example, many ships are now equipped with an unobtrusive alarm system.
A hidden button sets off an automatic message system alerting the ships owner as well as marine authorities that something bad or illegal is happening.
For added security, this message cant be detected by someone on board or even by other ships nearby.
Many larger ships are often attacked by small boats with pirates using ladders to ascend the walls of the ship, climb on board, and hold the crew hostage.
To prohibit such attacks, a simple fence can be installed all around a ship, complete with a 9,000-volt charge to shock pirates trying to board.
With any contact, this system will also set off alarms and activate floodlights.
Nevertheless, piracy on the high seas is far less common than the everyday piracy of intellectual property that many of us practice these days.
Intellectual property refers to ideas.
Increasingly, developed countries economies are dependent more on their ideas than on their natural resources.
Those who have done one of the following things may be considered to be pirates or to have at least helped pirates:
Ebought or used illegal software
Ebought or used illegal CDs
Edownloaded copyright music without paying
Emade photocopies of a magazine or book
In practical terms, using illegal software or engaging in any of the other illegal acts mentioned above can lead to three downsides.
The first is that the cost of piracy adds to the cost of the product.
If a thousand copies of something are sold for a certain amount of money and another thousand copies are pirated, then the price of this product will likely have to be doubled in order for the authorized sellers to make the same profit.
The second issue is that piracy discourages innovation.
People who create software, for instance, can become discouraged by the high degree of software piracy.
They may stop creating new software because they consider it a waste of time.
This could lead to a situation in which no one would want to work, especially if he or she were underpaid or didnt get paid at all.
Thirdly, intellectual property piracy creates a culture in which it is acceptable to use things without paying.
People who, for example, download music illegally from the Internet may have an increasing disrespect for paying for any kind of intellectual property.
In many countries, illegal copies and pirated goods are even sold by gangsters.
Are these the sorts of people that should be supported?
To defend itself against piracy, the intellectual property industry has been trying to tackle this problem by using several approaches, including education, legal prosecution, copy protection, and concessions:
EEducation involves making people aware of the problems associated with intellectual property piracy.
ELegal prosecution involves making examples of some individuals and organizations that violate intellectual property rights.
ECopy protection measures have been introduced on many forms of software, music, and videos to make them more difficult to copy and disperse.
EConcessions have also been made by the intellectual property industry.
For example, many software companies now offer student discounts, and music downloads are now available at reasonable prices.
It seems clear that todays pirates have good reasons to stop stealing and obey the law.
