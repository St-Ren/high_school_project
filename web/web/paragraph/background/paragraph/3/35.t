Remember the times when Mom or Dad would cuddle up to you at bedtime and read a bedtime story to you?
I can still remember the comforting weight of the book on my lap and the sound of turning the pages, as my mother uncovered a new world for me.
Imagine how it would feel if this crinkle of crisp pages were replaced by the small screen of an e-book reader.
E-books are books that can be read through an electronic medium.
In other words, these books are not on paper; they are read digitally on a computer, laptop, or e-reader.
Many people feel that the e-book is the greatest innovation in the literary world.
E-books were not as popular in the earlier 1s; however, thanks to high-speed portable reading devices where thousands of books can be stored, people have slowly started taking an interest in e-books.
As a matter of fact, in July 2, Amazon.com reported that more e-books were sold than hardcovers.
Keeping this new technology's popularity in mind, Google also launched Google eBooks in 2.
Through this service, all the books that Google has scanned, converted to text, and stored in its digital database can be viewed and searched.
With such a service, the traditional hardcover book may soon be a thing of the past.
Many favor the e-book, as it has several advantages over a paper book (or p-book).
An e-book reader is light and portable.
It is the same size as a regular p-book, but the contents of thousands of e-books can be stored in one small reader.
Wouldn't it be great if we could carry thousands of books in a small hardware device in our pocket?
Although e-readers can be a little costly, e-books are more economical in the long run.
It is cheaper to buy a thousand e-books than to buy a thousand hardcover books.
Most readers also love the fact that the contents of the e-reader can be "searched" and books belonging to the same category can be recommended automatically.
Also, people can easily bookmark a page or a line and come back to the same exact spot when they begin to read again.
In spite of the advantages an e-book may boast, some people feel that reading a hardcover book is not solely an intellectual pursuit but an emotional and spiritual one as well.
Most of us have been raised to believe that books are so valuable that they need to be cherished and respected.
We all have at least a few books that may not be antiques, but still hold a special place in our heart.
Some books have a cloth-case wrap or a leatherette or a foil-stamped cover.
Others have heavier paper or better binding.
These distinctive features make them worth collecting.
Moreover, no matter how many years pass, these old friends still give us the familiar comfort of turning each page and writing notes in the margin-a sentiment you will never experience with an e-book.
All said and done, most readers are of the opinion that "how you read" is not as important as "will you read."
E-book owners find it more convenient to read now because they don't need to look for books in stores or libraries.
P-book readers' sentiment, on the contrary, represents another idea of how books should be.
As James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, said, the new immigrants don't shoot the old inhabitants when they come in; they all learn to live together.
So, whether you choose to read a p-book or an e-book shouldn't matter so much.
After all, the essence of a book lies in its content rather than its form.
