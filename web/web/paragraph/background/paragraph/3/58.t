From Head to Foot.
SoccerXwhich is called football outside of the United States and CanadaXis the worlds most popular sport.
It is played in parks, fields, schools, and streets all over the world.
It has about 250 million male and female players in more than two hundred countries, and it has even more fans.
In fact, it has become the worlds most-watched televised sporting event, even surpassing the Olympics.
The exact origins of modern soccer are unknown.
However, records indicate that the Chinese and Japanese played similar games over two thousand years ago.
Later, the ancient Greeks and Romans played it.
The Romans took the game to Britain, which became the undisputed birthplace of modern soccer.
In Britain, the game came to be called football, because only the players feet could touch the ball.
However, when the British played football, it was more like war than a game.
Towns and villages played against one another, and sometimes up to five hundred people played on each team.
There were even annual contests where large groups ran wildly from village to village playing the game.
One game could last all day.
Naturally, many people were injured and some even died.
Several kings legally banned the game because it was so rough, and because soldiers preferred to play it rather than concentrate on their military training.
Even Queen Elizabeth had players in London put in jail because they caused so much damage to shops and public property when they played football in the streets.
But the game was too popular to be stopped.
The Football Association of England was formed in 1863.
At that time, university students liked to create slang terms by adding -er to words they shortened.
The name soccer developed from adding -er to the letters S, O, and C (from the word association).
However, the game is still known as football in most parts of the world except for most of North America, where soccer is more commonly used.
Football quickly became popular throughout Europe and South America, and in 1900 it became one of the first team sports played in the Olympic Games.
In 1904, seven nationsXBelgium, Spain, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, and SwitzerlandXmet in Paris to form FIFA, the Federation International de Football Association.
FIFA has been the governing body of the sport ever since.
Today, it has 204 member countries.
Every four years, the worlds strongest national football teams compete to become world champions by winning the World CupXa golden trophy.
The World Cup tournament was started in 1930.
Beginning in 1958, it was held alternately in Europe and the Americas, but since 2002 it has been held in Asian and African countries as well.
Throughout history, football was considered unsuitable for women in Europe, and they were banned from playing it.
However, in the 1970s women were finally allowed to play, and the sports popularity started to grow.
This trend has continued.
Since 1996, womens football has been included in the Olympic Games, and today more than seven million girls play in the United States alone.
The United States, though a newcomer to the womens game, has won the World Cup twice and has also won two Olympic gold medals and one silver medal.
Football was first introduced to Brazil by a British man named Charles Miller, who started a team there.
In 1899, this team played the countrys first recorded game of football.
Today, football is a way of life in Brazil.
The Brazilian team was the first team to win the World Cup five times, and it has more professional teams than any other country in the world.
Its most talented players, including Pele, Garrincha, Zico, and many others, have made Brazil legendary throughout the world.
Brazil is not the only country with football stars.
