"I'm standing here at the finish line of today's marathon in Taipei, where more than 4, participants are in a frenzy of excitement as they enjoy a great feeling of solidarity.
Everywhere I look there are panting runners drenched in sweat, and spectators are shouting out words of encouragement to those who are just finishing.
What a scene!
The atmosphere is heating up here, not because of the weather, but because of the outburst of enthusiasm."
This reporter definitely got one thing right: the marathon is truly a remarkable sport.
But most people don't realize that this increasingly popular activity goes all the way back to ancient times.
The marathon is a long-distance race named after the Greek town where the sport originated.
In 4 B.C., Greece was invaded by the Persians.
The residents of the capital city, Athens, had no idea that their army had already defeated the Persians nearby at Marathon until one man, Pheidippides, had run the whole way from that town to inform them.
Legend has it that he ran into the Senate and bellowed "Victory!"
before falling down on the floor and dying from exhaustion.
To honor that legendary runner, a long-distance race was held from the Marathon Bridge to the Olympic Stadium in Athens when the first modern Olympic Games were held in 1.
Since then, the sport has continued to attract runners of all ages around the world.
Most new runners are attracted to the sport because it is a great way to lose weight and keep in shape.
Running also provides them with an outlet for their excess energy and allows them to relieve their stress.
But as runners build up their endurance, many find that they need to run longer and longer distances to get that same feeling of satisfaction.
Some even claim they feel a "runner's high," perhaps the result of chemicals released in the body during activities that require stamina and endurance.
By running more kilometers each time, runners challenge themselves to push their bodies to the limit, and the resulting sense of accomplishment is what motivates them to participate in marathons.
Some runners become so addicted that they would rather run a marathon than compete in any other sport.
But perhaps you may get cold feet just from the thought of signing up for a marathon.
If so, then you need to do some training to develop your confidence and strengthen your body.
Experts suggest starting small and then working your way up.
If you are only comfortable with three kilometers at first, then make that your starting point.
Set a routine, for example three times per week.
When you feel you're ready, add another kilometer to your run.
Before long, you will be running ten kilometers, then a half marathon ( km), and finally a full marathon ( km)!
During your training, keeping a good diet is essential.
Carbohydrates such as bananas and pasta provide much-needed energy, and plenty of water helps the body to stay hydrated.
Overloading yourself with greasy food or too much protein is strongly discouraged because these are difficult to digest.
By following the above-mentioned tips, you will be well on your way to running your first full marathon!
"Well, it's time to finish our report on the Taipei marathon.
I must admit that I've never even entertained the thought of running a marathon before.
But today, I witnessed all kinds of people brought together by an activity that not only increases one's fitness but also provides a sense of achievement.
In this sport, it is not the finish line that matters but rather the journey you go on to get there.
Next time, I'm going to sign up, too!
Will I see you out there?"
