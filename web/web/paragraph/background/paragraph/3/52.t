Weather Phenomena.
All around the world, strange things have been falling from the sky.
Eyewitnesses have reported seeing fish and frog rainstorms.
Others have seen falling ice the size of baseballs and balls of light dancing in the sky.
These may sound like jokes, but these kinds of weird weather reports have been around for hundreds of years.
An early report came from Worcester, England, in 1881.
Townspeople saw masses of crabs and snails fall to the ground during a thunderstorm.
Another incident was reported in Kansas City, Missouri in 1873, when hundreds of frogs came down with the rain.
Similar reports have continued throughout the years in Wales, India, and Singapore, to name a few.
A more recent one came from the mountain village of Korona in Greece in 2004.
Villagers saw heaps of tiny fish come down during a rain shower.
Some scientists believe that these freak storms can be explained by strong winds that move above a body of water.
These powerful winds suck up everything in their way into the storm clouds.
The clouds carry the objects for a while before releasing them with rain.
Fish have been carried hundreds of miles before being released by the clouds during a rainstorm.
Because the clouds are very high up, the temperature is very cold-- so cold that there have been reports of frozen fish falling to the ground!
Fish and frogs are not the only strange things falling from the sky during a storm.
Giant hailstones are another weather condition that is out of the ordinary.
Giant hail can damage cars and crops and can even kill small animals.
Hail forms from rain and ice in the clouds.
Windy conditions prevent the water from falling and blow it up higher to colder temperatures.
As it goes up, the rain freezes into hail.
Its heavy weight makes it fall.
However, strong winds may blow the hail back up again, causing it to get even bigger and heavier as more water freezes onto it.
The hail gets bigger and bigger.
Finally, such is the size of the hail that the wind can no longer blow it upward, and it falls to the ground.
Yet another phenomenon that comes from the sky is strange balls of light called ball lightning.
Many people from all over the world have reported seeing these eerie glowing balls dancing in the sky during a violent thunderstorm.
Ball lightning is unpredictable.
It might glide parallel to the ground, but it might also bounce like a ball.
There are various sizes of ball lightning.
It can be as small as a baseball or as big as a car.
Ball lightning is usually red and yellow, changing to white before disappearing.
With the disappearance of ball lightning, there might be a loud bang along with a bright color.
Generally, ball lightning lasts for about twenty seconds, but it might stay around for a few minutes.
There are numerous
theories about ball lightning but scientists can't agree on exactly what it is or why it behaves the way it does.
As scientists gain more and more knowledge about meteorology, we will eventually find out the causes of these mysterious phenomena.
Whatever the causes are, these strange weather phenomena will continue to fascinate, or bother, people around the world.
