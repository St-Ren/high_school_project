Unit 1  See for Yourself.
Eric Chen, a twenty-year-old college student from Taiwan, has joined the Work and Travel USA program and has been working in Florida as a waiter in a buffet restaurant for three weeks.
His duties include refilling trays and cleaning tables for customers.
Boring as the job might seem, Eric has gained some special experiences from it.
For example, a local customer wearing a Chinese tunic suit often practiced Mandarin with him, and an elderly lady once comforted him when he accidentally spilled salad dressing all over her clothes.
Whats more, every day before the buffet restaurant opens for customers, Eric sits down and eats with his co-workers the meal prepared specifically for them by the chef.
This helps Eric save money, so that he can afford to appreciate some of the areas famous tourist attractions on weekends.
Pamela Tsai, on the other hand, just graduated from college this year and is visiting Australia on the Australia Working Holiday Visa.
Currently, she is working in a peach orchard near Melbourne.
Before this, she worked at three other jobs: One was lobster packaging, another was grape pruning, and the other was ski repairing.
Pamela likes Australias relaxed atmosphere, but the job she is doing now is not easy.
From 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., under the blazing sun, she needs to reach up and bend down to pick the fruits, and put them into buckets.
Pamela, like many of the other working holiday travelers there, lives in an on-site caravan park, which provides backpackers with basic accommodations.
After this job, she will join the Great Ocean Road tour and then fly to the Gold Coast to enjoy the beaches and sunshine there.
It goes without saying that before Eric and Pamela set off on their journeys, they did a lot of research to find out the specific details of these programs.
The Work and Travel USA program is open to students ranging in age from 18 to 28.
After employers in cooperation with the program examine applicants personal information and r?sum?s, every applicant selected will have an interview with the program manager.
Although students are required to possess a certain level of proficiency in English in order to live and work in the United States, what matters most is their passion and willingness to share and communicate.
This is what Eric discovered before he decided to participate in the Work and Travel USA program.
As for Pamela, a 21-year-old woman who is fond of beautiful landscapes and natural environments, Australia was her first choice.
As a result, she googled working holiday in Australia to know more about the life and jobs there.
She learned that people who are older than 18 and younger than 30 are eligible to apply for the Australia Working Holiday Visa.
She also found out that if she got a job there, she could earn some money to supplement her funds while she was traveling abroad during the 12 months on this visa.
Programs like the Work and Travel USA and the Working Holiday encourage young people to explore our planet.
In addition to making money and gaining valuable work experience, those who take part in these programs can develop global perspectives, get a real taste of foreign cultures, and enhance their ability to solve problems.
However, without a full understanding of these programs and a positive attitude, no one is guaranteed a memorable, worthwhile trip.
Whoever is interested in these programs should be prepared for hard work, unexpected situations, and even problems like racial discrimination.
When you are physically and mentally ready, go and see for yourself how amazing the world is.
