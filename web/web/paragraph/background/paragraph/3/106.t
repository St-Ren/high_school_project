Unit 4 The Teacher Who Changed My Life.
The person who shaped the course of my life was a schoolteacher named Marjorie Hurd.
When I stepped off a ship in New York Harbor on a gray March day in 1949, I was a nine-year-old war refugee, who had lost his mother and was coming to live with the father he did not know.
My mother, Eleni Gatzoyiannis, had been imprisoned, tortured, and shot by Communist guerrillas for sending my sisters and me to freedom.
I was thirteen years old when I entered Chandler Junior High.
Shortly after I arrived, I was told to select a hobby to pursue during club hours. The idea of hobbies and clubs made no sense to my immigrant ears, but I decided to follow the prettiest girl in my class.
She led me into the presence of Miss Hurd, the school newspaper adviser and English teacher who would become my mentor and my muse.
A formidable woman with gray hair and steely eyes, Miss Hurd had no patience with the lazy.
If theres anybody in this room who doesnt like to work, I suggest he or she go across to the glee club now, because youre going to work your tails off here! she roared.
I was soon under Miss Hurds spell.
She drilled us in grammar, assigned stories for us to read and discuss, and eventually taught us how to put out a newspaper.
Her introduction to the literary wealth of Greece gave me a new perspective on my war-ravaged homeland, making me proud of my origins.
Her efforts spurred me on to understand the logic and structure of the English language.
Owing to her inspiration, during my next twenty-five years, I became a journalist by profession.
One day, she made us compose an essay from our own experience.
Fixing me with a stern look, she added, Nick, I want you to write about what happened to your family in Greece. I had been trying to put those painful memories behind me, and I left the assignment until the last moment.
Then, on a warm spring afternoon, I sat in my room with a pad and pencil.
I started to write, one line after another, telling how the Communist guerrillas occupied our village, how my mother planned escape with my sisters and me, and how, at the last moment, she could not get away with us because the guerrillas sent her to a distant village.
I wrote about that particular nighttime escape across fields and into lines of soldiers, who had then sent us to a refugee camp.
It was there that my sisters and I learned of our mothers execution.
I felt very lucky to have come to America, I concluded, but every year, the coming of spring always reminded me of the last time I saw my mother on a green and gold day in 1948.
Miss Hurd had the essay published in the school paper.
This humiliated me, until I saw that my classmates reacted with sympathy to my familys story.
Miss Hurd also submitted the essay to a contest, and it won a medal.
The local paper wrote about the award.
My father was ecstatic with pride, and the Greek community celebrated the honor to one of its own.
For the first time, I began to understand the power of the written word.
Meanwhile, I followed the literary path that Miss Hurd had so forcefully set me on.
In high school, I became an editor of my school paper and got a part-time job at a local newspaper.
Although my father could only offer me $50 and encouragement toward a college education, I managed to finance four years at Boston University with scholarships and part-time jobs in journalism.
When I graduated, it was Miss Hurd who attended the ceremony with my father and shared our joy.
She was also one of the first to call me on December 10, 1987, while President Reagan was delivering a television speech after a summit meeting with Gorbachev.
President Reagan told the nation that Eleni Gatzoyianniss dying cry of My children! had helped inspire him to seek an arms agreement for all the children of the world.
I cant imagine a better monument to your mother, Miss Hurd said with an uncharacteristic catch in her voice.
Miss Hurd retired at the age of 62.
By then, she had taught for a total of 41 years.
Even after her retirement, though, she continually made a project of some stubborn students in whom she spied a spark of potential.
The students were mainly from the most troubled homes, yet she would alternately bully and charm them with her own special brand of tough love, until their spark caught fire.
Miss Hurd was the one who directed my grief and pain into writing.
Had it not been for Miss Hurd, I wouldnt have become a reporter, recording the story of my mothers life and death in Greece.
She was the catalyst that sent me into journalism and indirectly caused all the good things in my life that came after.
Miss Hurd, however, would probably deny this emphatically.
