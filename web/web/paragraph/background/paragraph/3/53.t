Three Days to See.
I have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days at some time during his early adult life.
Darkness would make him more appreciative of sight; silence would teach him the joys of sound.
Now and then I have tested my seeing friends to discover what they see.
Recently I was visited by a very good friend who had just returned from a long walk in the woods, and I asked her what she had observed.
Nothing in
particular, she replied.
How was it possible, I asked myself, to walk for an hour through the woods and see  nothing worthy of note?
I, who cannot see, find hundreds of things to interest me through mere touch.
I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf.
I pass my hands lovingly above the smooth skin of a silver birch.
In spring, I touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud.
Occasionally, if I am very fortunate, I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel the happy quiver of a bird in full song.
I am delighted to have the cool waters of a brook rush through my open fingers.
To me a lush carpet of pine needles or spongy grass is more welcome than the most luxurious Persian rug.
Perhaps I can best illustrate by imagining what I should most like to see if I, by some miracle, were granted three seeing days.
On the first day, I should want to see the people whose kindness and gentleness and companionship have made my life worth living.
First I should like to gaze long upon the face of my dear teacher, Anne Sullivan, who came to me when I was a child and opened the outer world to me.
I should want not merely to see the outline of her face, so that I could cherish it in my memory, but to study that face and find in it the living evidence of the sympathetic tenderness and patience with which she accomplished the difficult task of my education.
I should also view the small simple things of my home.
My eyes would rest respectfully on the books in raised type, for during the long night of my life they have revealed to me the deepest channels of human life.
The next day I should arise with the dawn and see the thrilling miracle by which night is transformed into day.
This day I should devote to a hasty glimpse of the world, past and present.
Often I have visited the New York Museum of Natural History to touch with my hands many of the objects there, but I have longed to see with my eyes the condensed history of the earthXanimals pictured in their native environment; gigantic carcasses of dinosaurs; realistic presentations of the process of evolution in animals.
The evening of my second day of sight I should spend at a theater.
Even now I often attend theatrical performances of all sorts, but the action of the play must be spelled into my hand by a companion.
But how I should like to see with my own eyes the fascinating figure of Hamlet!
If I could see only one play, I should know how to picture in my mind the action of a hundred plays which I have read or had transferred to me through the medium of the manual alphabet.
The following morning, I should again greet the dawn, anxious to discover new delights.
This day I should spend in the workaday world of the present.
I should hurry to one of those gigantic structures, the Empire State Building.
I am sure I would not be disappointed in the panorama spread before me.
I should stroll down Fifth Avenue to make a tour of the city, to slums, to factories, to parks.
I should stand at a busy corner, merely looking at people, trying by sight of them to understand something of their lives.
I see smiles, and I am happy.
I see serious determination, and I am proud.
I see suffering, and I am compassionate.
My third day of sight is drawing to an end.
At midnight my temporary respite from blindness would cease, and permanent night would close in on me again.
But my mind would be so overcrowded with glorious memories that I should have little time for regrets.
Perhaps this short outline of how I should spend three days of sight does not agree with the program you would set for yourself if you knew that you were about to be stricken blind.
I am, however, sure that if you actually faced that fate you would use your eyes as never before.
Everything you saw would become dear to you, and
a new world of beauty would open itself before you.
I, who am blind, can give one hint to those who see: use your eyes as if tomorrow you would be stricken blind.
And the same method can be applied to other senses.
Hear the music of voices and the song of a bird as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow.
Touch each object you want to touch as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail.
Smell the perfume of flowers, taste each morsel, as if tomorrow you could never smell and taste again.
Make the most of every sense, but of all the senses, I am sure that sight must be the most delightful.
