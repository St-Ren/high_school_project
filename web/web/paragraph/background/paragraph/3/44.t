If the Earth were a single state, Istanbul would be its capital.
-Napoleon Bonaparte
Napoleon, who once ruled France as emperor, was fiercely proud of his French homeland.
Therefore it might seem surprising that he would suggest a city in Turkey rather than France to be a global capital.
But Istanbul is no ordinary city.
Throughout history, it has stood virtually at the crossroads of the world, and its charming culture has been influenced by some of the Earth's most powerful civilizations.
Istanbul is split in two by the Bosphorus.
On one side of the channel, the city is in Europe, but on the other, it's very much in Asia, meaning that Istanbul is a place where East literally meets West.
Overland routes between Europe and Asia pass through Istanbul, and the city has links to both the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea.
Istanbul's unique geographical location means that it has always been a center for international trade.
Historically, it was a major city at the western end of the legendary Silk Road.
This ancient trading route linked China with Europe, Africa, and the rest of Asia.
It was used to transport Chinese products, including porcelain, paper, gunpowder, and of course silk, to the West.
Moving in the opposite direction, spices, jewelry, leather, and rare plants and animals went through Istanbul on their way to the East.
Istanbul's singular location also made it attractive as a political center.
Three great empires-the Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman-chose Istanbul as their capital.
As successive empires fought to gain control of the city, it was repeatedly ravaged.
Fortunately, Istanbul's new rulers spared no expense in their rebuilding efforts.
They also brought their traditions and religious beliefs, which included Islam and Christianity.
As cultural diversity increased in Istanbul, so did cross-cultural exchanges, and churches and mosques can now be found side by side in the city.
Hagia Sophia is a beautiful example of how different cultural elements have been blended together in one building.
Originally built as a Christian church in the 4th century, it was converted into a mosque by Ottoman Turks when they took over Istanbul in the late 1th century.
The new Muslim rulers replaced Christian ceremonial objects with their own and whitewashed the Christianity-themed mosaics.
However, they didn't change the structure or outer appearance of the building.
In the 1s, Hagia Sophia was changed into a museum, and some of the whitewash on the walls was washed and scrubbed away to reveal the mosaics underneath.
The art and symbolism of two major religions can now be seen in this sublime edifice.
Facing Hagia Sophia is Sultan Ahmed Mosque, known as the Blue Mosque because of the blue tiles that decorate its interior.
This mosque is a fine example of traditional Islamic architecture, as it has minarets, prayer niches, and central fountains.
But it also incorporates some of the Byzantine elements of the neighboring Hagia Sophia, including mosaics, domes, and the lavish use of marble.
During his visit to the Blue Mosque in 2, Pope Benedict XVI said, "May all believers bear witness to true brotherhood."
He also expressed his hope that Turkey "will be a bridge of friendship and collaboration between East and West."
In the 2st century, the era of the global village, Istanbul has lost some of its geopolitical significance, but it is still the third largest metropolitan area in Europe and one of the most important tourist spots in Turkey.
The immense charm of the city lies in its exotic atmosphere, created through many centuries of cultural and religious confrontations, compromises, and fusions.
There may be a lot of global cities nowadays, but Istanbul will always have its special place because of its unique history.
