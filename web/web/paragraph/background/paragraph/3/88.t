Unit 7  The Cellist of Sarajevo.
As a pianist, I was invited to perform with a cellist at the International Cello Festival in Manchester, England.
The performance on that opening night consisted of works for unaccompanied cello.
On the stage was a solitary chair.
There was no piano, music stand, or conductors podium.
The world-famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma was one of the performers that night, and there was a moving story behind the musical composition that he was to play.
On May 27, 1992, in Sarajevo, one of the few bakeries that still had a supply of flour was making and distributing bread to the starving people in this war-torn city.
By 4 p.m., a long line had already formed and reached the street outside the bakery.
Suddenly, a mortar shell fell directly into the middle of the line, and twenty-two people were killed.
Flesh, blood, bone, and rubble splattered over the street.
Not far away lived a distinguished cellist named Vedran Smailovic.
No sooner had he seen the massacre outside his window than the immense amount of suffering overwhelmed him.
As a result, he resolved to do one thing he did bestXmake music.
For each of the next twenty-two days, at 4 p.m., Smailovic put on his full, formal concert attire, picked up his cello, and walked out of his apartment into the midst of the battle raging around him.
Placing a plastic chair beside the crater that the shell had made, he played one of the most mournful and haunting pieces in his repertoire.
He played to the abandoned streets, smashed trucks, and burning buildings, and to the terrified people who hid themselves in the cellars while the bombs dropped and the bullets flew.
With masonry exploding around him, he courageously fought for human dignity, for those who had been lost to war, for civilization, for compassion, and for peace.
Though the shelling went on, he was never hurt.
After newspapers picked up the story of this extraordinary man, an English composer named David Wilde was so moved that he wrote a composition for unaccompanied cello entitled The Cellist of Sarajevo, into which he poured his feelings of outrage, love, and brotherhood with Vedran Smailovic.
It was this very piece, The Cellist of Sarajevo, that Yo-Yo Ma was about to play that evening.
Ma came out on stage, bowed to the audience, and sat down quietly on a chair.
The music began, stealing into the hushed hall and creating a shadowy, empty universe.
Slowly the music grew into an agonized, screaming, and slashing furor, gripping us all before subsiding into a hollow death rattle and, eventually, back to silence.
When Ma had finished, he remained bent over his cello, with his bow resting on the strings.
No one in the hall moved or made a sound.
It was as though we had just witnessed that horrifying massacre ourselves.
Finally, Ma stood up, looked across the audience and stretched out his hand, inviting someone to come to the stage.
An indescribable feeling swept over us as we realized who it was: Vedran Smailovic, the cellist of Sarajevo.
Smailovic rose from his seat and walked down the aisle, and Ma left the stage to meet him.
They threw their arms around each other in an embrace.
Everyone in the hall erupted in chaotic, emotional excitementXclapping, shouting, and cheering.
These two men hugged and cried unashamedly: Yo-Yo Ma, an elegant cellist of classical music, flawless in appearance and performance, and Vedran Smailovic, dressed in a stained, tattered leather motorcycle jacket.
His wild, long hair, a huge beard, and mustache framed a face that looked old beyond his years, soaked with tears and lined with pain.
We were all stripped down to our deepest humanity at encountering this man, who had shaken his cello like a fist in the face of bombs, ruins, and death.
Without a doubt, his cello was the mightiest weapon of all.
Now that the story behind the composition shows us the power of music, we should value this gift we all share equally.
Whether we create it or simply listen to it, its a gift that can soothe, inspire, and unite us, especially when we need it mostXand expect it least.
