Unit 3 Three Days to See.
I have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days at some time during his or her early adult life.
Darkness would make this person more grateful for sight; silence would teach this individual the joys of sound.
Recently, I was visited by a very good friend of mine.
I asked her what she had observed from a long walk in the woods.
Nothing in particular, she replied.
Had I not been accustomed to such responses, I might have been incredulous, for long ago I became convinced that the seeing see little.
How was it possible to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing worthy of note?
I, who cannot see, find hundreds of things to interest me through mere touch.
I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf.
In spring, I touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud, the first sign of awakening nature after her winters sleep.
Occasionally, if I am very fortunate, I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel the happy quiver of a bird in full song.
It is human, perhaps, to appreciate little that which we have and to long for that which we dont have, but it is a great pity that in the world of light, the gift of sight is used only as a mere convenience, rather than as a means of adding fullness to life.
If, by some miracle, I were granted three seeing days, I should divide the period into three parts.
On the first day, I should want to see the people whose kindness, gentleness, and companionship have made my life worth living.
First, I should like to gaze long upon the face of my dear teacher, Mrs. Anne Sullivan Macy, who came to me when I was a child and opened the outer world to me.
I should want not merely to see the outline of her face, so that I could cherish it in my memory, but to study that face and find in it the living evidence of the sympathetic tenderness and patience with which she accomplished the difficult task of my education.
I should like to see in her eyes that strength of character which has enabled her to stand firm in the face of the plight and that compassion for all humanity which she has revealed to me so often.
On the second day of sight, I should devote my time to a hasty glimpse of the world, past and present, through museums.
I should try to investigate the soul of man through his art.
The whole magnificent world of painting would be opened to me, from the Italian Primitives, with their serene religious devotion, to the Moderns, with their feverish visions.
I should look deep into the canvases of Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci.
I should want to feast my eyes upon the warm colors of Veronese.
Oh, there is so much rich meaning and beauty in the art of the ages for you who have eyes to see!
On my third and last day of sight, I should spend this day in the workday world of the present, so the city becomes my destination.
From Fifth Avenue, I would make a tour of the cityXto Park Avenue, to the slums, to factories, to the parks where children play.
My eye would strive to touch and hold closely each thing its gaze rested upon.
Some sights would be pleasant, filling the heart with happiness; some would be miserably pathetic.
To the latter, I would not shut my eyes, for they, too, are part of life.
To close the eye on them is to close the heart and mind.
I can give one warning to those who see: Use your eyes as if tomorrow you would be stricken blind.
And the same method can be applied to other senses.
Hear the music of voices, the song of a bird, the vigorous strains of an orchestra, as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow.
Touch each object you want to touch as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail.
Smell the perfume of flowers, taste with enjoyment each scrap of food, as if tomorrow you could never smell or taste again.
Make the most of every senseXglory in all the aspects of pleasure and beauty which the world reveals to you through the several means of contact which nature provides.
But of all the senses, I am sure that sight must be the most delightful.
