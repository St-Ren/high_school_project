Can Fashion Be Hazardous to Your Health?
Just because something is popular, or fashionable, doesn't mean that it will be good for your health.
Throughout history, whether in Western or Eastern countries, people have done unhealthy things to their bodies just to be fashionable.
Even today there are many people who risk their health just to be in style.
In the sixteenth century, for example, white skin was the ideal, and many European women put white makeup on their faces to be in style.
Unfortunately, the makeup they put on their faces was made with the poisonous metals such as lead and mercury.
Used over a long period of time, the makeup could eventually remove layers of skin, cause teeth to fall out, and even poison people, leading to death.
Some women were even willing to drink small amounts of the poison arsenic because it made them look fashionably pale.
While many types of cosmetics are harmless, there are some that can be dangerous indeed.
Apart from misconceptions concerning the use of the cosmetics, the popularity of corsets in Europe also provided an opportunity for women to exchange health for beauty.
A corset is a tight-fitting piece of clothing that a woman wore to change the shape of her body.
Corsets were supposed to provide every woman with the tiny waist that was so fashionable at the time.
Unfortunately, corsets were also known to break ribs, puncture lungs, cause indigestion, and bring on shortness of breath.
In ancient China, the practice of foot binding is another example of beauty at the price of health.
In general, feet that were bound were two times smaller than normal feet.
Foot binding involved a very painful procedure that usually began when a young girl was between the ages of three and six.
During the procedure, the four smaller toes on each foot were broken and turned under, and the feet were wrapped tightly with a bandage.
Each day, the bandage was tightened a little more to make the foot smaller and smaller.
After several years, the child's feet were just eight to ten centimeters long, making it impossible for her to walk naturally.
Moreover, the procedure itself was hazardous, with perhaps as many as 10 percent of the girls dying from infection or circulation problems caused by the tight bandages.
While the binding of feet might seem absurd to us today, women continue to do damage to their feet in the name of beauty.
Wearing high heels, for example, shortens the muscles of the lower leg and can cause the back to arch unnaturally.
This can lead to serious back problems and nerve damage.
When ultra-high platform shoes were popular in Japan, police officers found that they were the major cause of many car accidents.
They said that the thick soles of the shoes slowed the response time of drivers, especially when they had to brake in an emergency.
In some parts of the world, people are willing to pay for a procedure known as leg stretching just to become taller.
This procedure involves breaking the leg bones and then slowly stretching the legs.
The risks include nerve damage, bones becoming too weak to support the body, and uneven legs.
History is full of examples of extraordinary things people are willing to do in the name of fashion.
Not even pain, medical complications, or the risk of death have discouraged people from trying to become more beautiful.
