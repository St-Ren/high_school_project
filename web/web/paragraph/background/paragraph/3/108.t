Unit 6 The LOHAS Era.
In 2000, the sociologist Paul H. Ray and psychologist Sherry Anderson identified a new movement in consumer culture and, thereby, coined the word LOHAS. LOHAS, which stands for Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability, is a segment of the market that is related to sustainable living.
The LOHAS market includes physical products, such as organically grown food, hybrid vehicles, and energy efficient appliances, as well as lifestyle choices, like alternative health care, socially responsible financial investing, and personal development that focuses on the mind, body, and soul.
As a way of life, LOHAS has a lot to do with individual choices.
A typical LOHAS consumer, or sometimes also known as a lohasian, has a holistic world view, believing that global economies, cultures, and environments are all connected.
Each decision a person makes, whether its about what kind of apartment to buy or where to take a vacation, has an impact on the entire world.
In short, there are many things individuals can do to lead a LOHAS lifestyle.
In terms of wellness, individuals can consider what they can do to improve their health.
These people are often recommended to pursue activities that balance the body and the mind.
Yoga, for example, is perfect for this.
Alternative medicine, including the use of food therapies and nutritional supplements, is an excellent way to maintain ones health, too.
As for another important element of the LOHAS lifestyle, individuals can make an effort to use recycled or renewable items, if given the option.
For instance, buying a table made of waste wood would be much better for the planet.
Moreover, thinking carefully about the food that we consume is also important.
If individuals eat locally grown food, rather than food that has been grown hundreds of miles away, they can help to significantly reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that is given off by vehicles during the transportation of food.
In addition to the efforts being made by individuals, businesses are also starting to foster LOHAS values.
As a consistent advocate of this idea of sustainability, the Taiwanese company ASUS uses eco-friendly materials in the production of its computers and manufactures computers that consume less energy.
ASUS also specializes in recycling old electronics in a way that does not harm the environment.
If someone needs to get rid of an old notebook computer, ASUS will dispose of the machine properly so that hazardous chemicals will not be released into the atmosphere.
The Japanese company MUJI has devised a smart way to recycle cotton lint, a by-product of spinning mills, to make all-natural clothing, instead of just throwing it away.
Whats more, MUJI refuses to use non-recyclable PVC and has removed all unnecessary decoration from its products in favor of a simpler design.
It is clear that the same principles of LOHAS that are associated with individualsXspecifically, reduce, reuse, and recycleXare being made manifest in some businessesXbut on a much larger scale.
In another respect, LOHAS can be practiced on a national level as well.
Countries worldwide can publicize the importance of LOHAS and influence their citizens through legislation or education.
For example, lawmakers can either regulate factories to curb pollution or tax unhealthy foods to encourage healthier eating habits.
Should laws be ineffective in influencing the general population, governments can promote LOHAS ideals via education.
Taiwans Ministry of Education has done just this.
It has established LOHAS exercise stations in unused classrooms in order to motivate students to get into the habit of exercising.
By providing fun activities, like rock climbing programs, educators can do their part to urge on students and even their families in the pursuit of healthier lifestyles.
By and large, the concept of LOHAS can bring positive results to the world, but what is perhaps most noteworthy is that it starts with each individual.
Fortunately, more and more consumers are now seeing the connection between their personal health and the health of the planet.
From 2007 to 2008, the number of consumers who prefer natural, biodegradable products grew by 27 percent.
Ultimately, each one of us is accountable not only for our own health but for the health of the globe, and those who have adopted a LOHAS lifestyle are making our planet a better place to live.
