A Trip to Lanyu.
The weather was fine.
We six city people were getting ready to land on Lanyu, also known as Orchid Island, in a small, propeller-driven airplane.
All of us were eager to explore this small and isolated place, located off the southeastern coast of Taiwan.
As we came closer, we could see the landscape of weathered coastal rocks, rivers, and volcanoes.
We got a glimpse of Lanyus tropical rain forestXthe only rain forest existing on any of the islands near Taiwan.
Our eyes were also searching the coast for any signs of the aboriginal people that populate Lanyu, the peace-loving Tao, whose isolation from the outside world has helped to preserve their traditional culture and also allowed them to maintain their home as a self-sufficient paradise on the sea.
No sooner had we landed than we made arrangements to hire scooters, as they provide the most convenient way to enjoy the islands primitive scenery.
While riding along, we saw unusual rock formations and caves, and also caught frequent glimpses of soaring birds and flitting butterflies, including unusual species such as the Lanyu birdwings that are native to Orchid Island.
We stopped every so often to observe some rare insect or plant.
We also frequently gave way to goats and pigs strolling across the road.
With no traffic lights on the island, these animals seem to provide an effective system of traffic control.
We stopped as well at several villages along the way, where we were warmly greeted by the hospitable Tao people and invited for a meal of flying fish.
It was easy to tell that it was flying fish season, as we could see the fish hanging on wooden shelves and poles in front of almost every house.
Continuing along the road, which runs thirty-six kilometers around the island, we came across a beachside display of the colorful canoes that are the Tao peoples primary fishing vessel and one of the prides of their culture.
Special care goes into making these boats.
They are composed of twenty-one or twenty-seven wooden planks assembled without the use of nails.
The assembly and decorating of the boats takes place at an annual contest held every June.
There is a launching ritual at which the male villagers wear their traditional loincloths and the women, also dressed in traditional garments, sing and dance.
The ceremony is solemn, yet full of energy and beauty.
Our round-the-island trip also took us past a number of traditional Tao houses.
We were lucky enough to be able to visit one of these unusual semi-subterranean dwellings, which are built in a shallow excavation that allows only the roof to show.
We learned that this ingenious method of construction keeps the house cool in summer, warm in winter, and nearly impervious to the fierce typhoons that strike the island frequently from May through September.
On the second day of our trip, we went snorkeling and enjoyed another of Lanyus best tourist activities.
Diving below the surface of the water, we were amazed at the colorful tropical fish and stunning beautiful coral reefs that we saw.
Our day of snorkeling was followed up with a most memorable dinner, which we enjoyed at the home of a local family.
As with most traditional Tao couples, the husband did the fishing for our dinner, leaving his wife to prepare the days catch of fresh lobster, which she served with yams and many other dishes.
We may be poor, but we eat lobster every day! the wife said jokingly.
On a more serious note, the husband told us that they had learned to live in peace with nature and appreciate a life of simplicity.
On the morning of our third and last day, we enjoyed breakfast at a stand next to the beach.
Tasting fresh seaweed salad for the first time and listening to the sound of the waves nearby, we experienced this paradise in yet another peaceful way.
Giving the island one final glance before taking off that afternoon, we said quietly to ourselves, We will definitely return to Lanyu, the last pearl in the Pacific Ocean.
