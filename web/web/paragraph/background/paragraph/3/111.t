To a Daughter Leaving Home
by Linda Pastan
When I taught you
at eight to ride
a bicycle, loping along
beside you
as you wobbled away
on two round wheels,
my own mouth rounding
in surprise when you pulled
ahead down the curved
path of the park,
I kept waiting
for the thud
of your crash as I
sprinted to catch up,
while you grew
smaller, more breakable
with distance,
pumping, pumping
for your life, screaming
with laughter,
the hair flapping
behind you like a
handkerchief waving
Reading this very moving poem written in the form of free verse, one can easily sense the mothers anxiety about her eight-year-old daughter possibly falling off the bike.
This contrasts strikingly with the little girls excited reaction to her newly acquired skill, which gives her mobility, enables her to expand her horizons, and, consequently, equips her with greater independence.
The poet not only sensitively captures two opposing states of mind, but also skillfully makes riding a bike a symbol of independence.
The poems emotional tension subtly exemplifies a paradox.
Although parents are willing to take on the burden of educating their children to become independent, they are often reluctant to give their children free rein in case the children should end up hurting themselves.
In addition, they are often fearful that their children are not ready for independence, just as these telling lines remind us: you grew / smaller, more breakable / with distance. Out of love, many parents find themselves yearning to protect their children, while simultaneously endeavoring to teach them how to live without their protection.
The child in the poem feels completely differently about the situation.
She is shown pumping for her life, with all her energy, and as she pedals away from her mother, she shouts and laughs to celebrate this great breakthrough, a milestone in her life.
When she pulls away unsteadily, her flapping hair seems to wave goodbye to her mother in triumph.
At first glance, the title of this poem seems unrelated to the event in the poem.
The poem is a reminiscence of an incident that happened a long time ago, when the daughter was a little girl still living at home.
However, the title of the poem specifically refers to the grown-up daughter getting ready to leave home.
The mother, addressing her older daughter, says nothing sentimental about the current prospect of their parting.
However, remembering this particular experience, she learns a profound lesson about her relationship with her child.
It is not until that moment, when the daughter is ready to depart, that the reality dawns on her former guardian: The young girl has been getting ready all along for this day of departure.
What such a caring and conscientious mother might have to say is, perhaps, Its time for you to be on your own.
Goodbye, and good luck!
