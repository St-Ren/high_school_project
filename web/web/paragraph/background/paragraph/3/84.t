Unit 3  The Earths Mysterious Neighbor.
The night was quiet except for the sound of the wind in the trees and the crackle of the torches.
Dozens of the villages bravest hunters glanced around nervously as they walked through the gloomy forest.
They were looking for the mysterious murderer that had killed five villagers during the last full moon.
Over in the distance, a very large shadow began to move closer.
As the clouds slipped past the full moon, the huge creature stood up on two legs, turned its head toward the moon, and began to howl like a wolf.
The above is a common scene describing the appearance of a werewolf on the night of a full moon.
In movies and in folklore, there are even more vivid accounts of how werewolves devour man after man, with blood dripping down their jaws.
Not all lunar legends are as horrifying as the werewolf story, of course, but most of them claim that the moon makes people lose control and start to act bizarrely.
During a full moon, according to some statistics, more murders and suicides occur, and even more cases of animal attack.
In the middle of the nineteenth century, the British Houses of Parliament declared that those who lost their minds and acted funnily only during a full moon should not face harsh penalties.
In other words, those who committed crimes during a full moon would not be punished severely, since it was the moon that had tempted them to break the law.
Interestingly, this example serves to illustrate how the English word lunatic comes from luna, the Latin word for the moon.
In fact, quite a few theories explain why serious incidents happen more frequently during a full moon than during the other phases of the moon.
One common theory says that before electricity was discovered, it was difficult to see at night, so most people stayed home and went to bed early.
However, the bright moonlight during a full moon enabled people to stay up engaging in more activities.
The greater the number of people who stayed out late was, the higher the chance was that certain incidents would occur.
Thus, stories about bad things happening during a full moon have accumulated over time, and people have made inferences about the negative influence that a full moon has on humans.
Whether those legends are true or not, that the moon is important to life on our planet is undeniable.
As the moon moves around the earth, its gravity creates tides on earth.
Each time the moon exerts its gravitational force on the surface of the earth, this brings energy and food to the planets living creatures.
For instance, crabs are able to find food in the intertidal zone while the tide is going out.
In brief, tidal movements allow wetlands to sustain life.
Moreover, scientists have discovered that the moons gravity keeps the earth stable.
Were it not for the moon, the earth would wobble on its axis, and different parts of the planet would point at the sun every year.
Taiwan, for example, might be frozen like the North Pole one year and hotter than the Sahara the next.
The climate would be in a terrible mess, not to mention the fact that people around the world would face a huge challenge of adapting themselves to the harsh weather conditions.
Lacking much knowledge about the moon, ancient people created mysterious legends as well as rituals.
They followed certain patterns of behavior according to the different phases of the moon.
Today, with the rapid development of science and technology, we have been able to gain more accurate information about how the moon has constantly influenced us in various ways.
It is not as unknown as it was to our ancestors, yet there are still many aspects of it waiting for us to explore.
Maybe in another decade, well be able to have a far deeper understanding of the moon, the earths mysterious neighbor.
