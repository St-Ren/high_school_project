What was your life like when you were a child?
How much do you enjoy your life now as a teenager?
Xin-ling Shen, an ordinary Taiwanese girl, has created many more opportunities for others since she was a fourth grader through generosity and sheer determination.
Born into an impoverished family, Shen was forced to travel around the island constantly with her parents, who earned a living as night market vendors in different cities.
Because of her family's unstable lifestyle, she never had the chance to go to preschool.
However, she made good use of every learning opportunity, such as learning words from shop signs she saw on the road.
When she became a fourth grader, she developed an interest in computers.
Even though her parents could barely make both ends meet, her mother sold her exquisite jade bracelet to buy Shen a computer.
Shen turned out to be a computer whiz, acquiring vital computer skills by reading computer books in bookstores for hours every day.
She learned to set up her own website at the age of twelve in order to help her parents sell clothes online.
Then she devised an online system to help farmers promote their pomelos.
At that time, this was an innovative form of farm produce marketing in Taiwan.
Later, numerous companies paid Shen to design their web pages.
By the time she was fourteen, she had accumulated NT$ million on her own.
What would you do with this sum of money?
Keeping all the money for herself was the last thing Shen wanted to do.
With her parents' encouragement, Shen gave it all to charity.
She developed the website ananedu.com so that children, especially poor children, could learn all their school subjects online for free.
Over three million people have visited this website.
First designed to serve students on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the website later had a Cambodian version added to it.
More amazingly, Shen even hosted a free summer English camp for children from disadvantaged families, all on her own.
She planned the summer camp, looked for appropriate venues, and invited teachers.
She even had to visit underprivileged families in person to convince the parents to send their children to the camp.
Such tasks could easily overwhelm an average fourteen-year-old girl.
The hardships, however, did not deter Shen because she wanted to give children the educational rights they had been deprived of due to poverty.
In addition to her dedication to education, Shen has always been concerned about the grassroots society in Taiwan.
She has developed her photography skills by taking photos of those who are economically disadvantaged.
She uses such images to remind the rest of the society of the contributions and the basic dignity of the poor.
So far, she has taken more than 2, pictures, and has added her own footnotes to each of them.
Her touching photographs were on display in Beijing during the 2 summer Olympics.
Shen never seems to lack ideas for making more contributions to the society.
She has been described as an angel to the underprivileged.
Shen has set a good example for us, and it is important that all of us make the best use of our own talents to help make Taiwan a better place to live in.
