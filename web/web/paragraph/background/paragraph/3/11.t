Stay-at-Home Economy Changing Our World.
A couple of years ago, a new word entered the English language: staycation. Simply put, a staycation is a vacation that is spent at home.
Europeans and North Americans are used to going away somewhere for their vacations.
The main reason for not doing so is probably financial.
When the global economy is struggling through a recession, fewer people have the spare cash to spend on travel, so they opt for a staycation instead.
However, avoiding travel during vacations is also part of a wider trend towards doing more activities at home, and it isnt necessarily a lack of money that is the cause.
Analysts have identified a whole new sector known as the stay-at-home economy.
This phrase describes different types of commercial activities that take place in the home.
Online shopping is an obvious one, but playing computer games, renting movies, and ordering food deliveries are all common examples of the stay-at-home economy in action.
All of these are areas that have undergone massive expansion in the past several years, and they are all part of a trend that is likely to continue.
It has been predicted, for example, that the number of online shoppers will double over the next five years as people look for ways to save time amid their busy schedules.
Also, a recent study found that almost 20 percent of Internet users already shop online at least once a month.
The main driving force behind the growth of the stay-at-home economy is undoubtedly new technology.
Most of us are aware of the convenience of shopping online, though we may not always pay enough attention to the dangers.
A few mouse clicks can get you the products you want with a fraction of the time and effort that a trip to a store would take.
And who needs to go all the way to a movie theater when you can order a  DVD on your computer, or have fun playing the latest online games, with their realistic graphics and sophisticated scenarios?
Most experts predict that the stay-at-home economy will continue to expand.
In the future, we can anticipate even more changes to the traditional ways we work, spend our money and leisure time, and even receive an education.
What we cant be sure about is how this trend will affect social interaction.
Are people going to become more and more alienated from one another?
Or will the communication revolution continue to help us cross boundaries and bring us closer together?
Only time will tell.
