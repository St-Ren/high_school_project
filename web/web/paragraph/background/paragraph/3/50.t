You Raise Me Up.
Life is not always a bed of roses.
There are times when everything in your life goes smoothly, and you regard yourself as the luckiest person in the world.
You have everything you desire, and everything seems to be going your way.
However, things can change all at once.
Suddenly, the situation is not as rosy as it was before, and then trouble emerges.
If you are a pessimist, you may feel your friends will all betray you, the world being against you.
The reality of life is that at times things will seem discouraging, but it is absolutely not the end of the world.
As was voiced by Martin Luther King, Jr., "Let us not wallow in the valley of despair."
We need to struggle out of our despair and confront our fate with perseverance and a positive attitude.
There are definitely ways to get rid of the dismay from our dreary days if we choose to remain optimistic.
For example, every student has something to worry about, like an exam result being one notch lower than expected, or a misunderstanding with friends that is tough to handle.
However, all these are just episodic events in life.
We should see the poor performance as a reminder to try harder so as to achieve a higher goal.
We also have to be reasonable when working out problems with friends.
This approach will lead to stronger friendships.
Bear in mind the saying: "After the storm comes the calm," which has stood the test of time.
In times of vulnerability, some people search for comfort by turning to religion, while others seek support from family or friends.
In the following song, we see two possible interpretations.
Some listeners may interpret the song as a religious song in which someone is thanking God for revelation and enlightenment when in despair.
Other listeners think the song is about someone showing gratitude for inspiration from someone significant.
Whichever interpretation we make, the lyrics convey that we can find a silver lining and obtain the uplifting power as long as we have a positive attitude.
You Rasie Me Up
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary; When troubles come and my heart burdened be; Then, I am still and wait here in the silence, Until you come and sit awhile with me.
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains; You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas; I am strong, when I am on your shoulders; You raise me up ... To more than I can be.
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains; You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas; I am strong, when I am on your shoulders; You raise me up ... To more than I can be.
There is no life-- no life without its hunger; Each restless heart beats so imperfectly; But when you come and I am filled with wonder, Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains; You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas; I am strong, when I am on your shoulders; You raise me up ... To more than I can be.
You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains; You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas; I am strong, when I am on your shoulders; You raise me up ... To more than I can be.
