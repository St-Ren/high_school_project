Madame Oreille was a little woman of about forty, very economical, and with a very short temper.
It really pained her to see any money spent.
Whenever she had to spend any, no matter how necessary it might be, she slept badly the next night.
Her husband was one of the head clerks in the Ministry of Defense.
For two years he had always come to the office with the same old patched umbrella, to the great amusement of his fellow clerks.
At last, he got tired of their jokes, and insisted upon his wifes buying him a new one.
She bought him one for eighteen francs, and said, getting red with anger as she gave it to her husband, This will last you for five years at least.
Mr. Oreille felt quite triumphant, and received a small ovation at the office with his new acquisition.
But he had scarcely got home that evening when his wife took the umbrella from him, examined it, and nearly had a fit when she found it covered with small holes, just as if someone had emptied the ashes from a lighted pipe onto it.
She threw the useless article at his head, screaming out in a violent rage.
You did it on purpose.
You shall not have another.
Then she started one of those scenes, which makes a peaceable man dread his wife more than a battlefield where bullets are raining.
After the storm had raged for an hour, a ring at the bell saved him.
It was a friend whom they were expecting to dinner.
After Madame Oreille submitted the case to their friend, he was suddenly inspired.
Make your fire insurance pay for it.
The companies pay for all articles that are burned, as long as the damage has been done in your own house.
On hearing this advice, Madame Oreille calmed down immediately and said to her husband, Tomorrow, before going to your office, youll go to the insurance company and make them pay for the damage.
Mr. Oreille was very astonished at the proposal.
I wouldnt do it for my life!
Its eighteen francs lost.
It wont ruin us.
The next morning he took a walking stick when he went out.
Luckily, it was a fine day.
Left at home alone, Madame Oreille could not get over the loss of her eighteen francs by any means.
Every moment she thought of the insurance company, she hesitated, for she was very timid when she had to speak to strangers.
But the regret at the loss of the eighteen francs pained her as if she had been wounded.
So she said to herself:
Ill go, and well see what will happen.
But first of all she was obliged to prepare the umbrella so that the disaster might be complete.
She took a match and burned a hole as big as the palm of her hand.
Then she went out with the umbrella.
After a short while, she got to the insurance company.
She could not help noticing how her heart beat as she entered.
She stopped a gentleman and said timidly:
I beg your pardon, but can you tell me where I must apply for payment for anything that has been accidentally burned?
He replied, The first door on the left.
She went there and knocked at the door.
A clear voice said, in answer: Come in!
She obeyed mechanically, and found herself in a large room where three solemn gentlemen were standing talking.
One of them asked her, What do you want?
She could scarcely speak but stammered, I have comewI have come on account of an accidentw
He very politely pointed out a seat to her.
What can I do for you?
She could hardly get out her words, but at last she managed to say: I have come for this.
The manager looked at the object that she held out to him in mute astonishment.
It looks to me to be in a very bad state of health, he said compassionately.
It cost me twenty francs, she said, with some hesitation.
He seemed astonished.
As much as that?
But I really dont understand what it has to do with me.
She began to feel uncomfortable; perhaps this company did not pay for such small articles, and she said:
Butwits burned.
He could not deny it.
I see that very well, he replied.
She felt her courage reviving.
She was not going to give up without a struggle.
She was not even afraid any more, and said:
Im Madame Oreille; were insured by your company, and Ive come to claim the value of this damage.
I only want you to pay me the cost of re-covering it.
The gentleman seemed rather confused.
Really, its such a very small matter!
Were never asked to give compensation for such trivial losses.
She got red in the face, and felt inclined to fly into a rage.
Your company is supposed to compensate for ANYTHING burned in my house!
As he thought that he had no chance of getting rid of her, and that he would only be wasting his time, he said resignedly, What do you estimate the damage at?
Well, I dont want to make any money out of you, so Ill tell you what well do.
Ill take my umbrella to the maker, who will re-cover it, and Ill bring the bill to you.
Will that suit you?
Perfectly, well settle it so.
Here is a note for the cashier, who will repay you whatever it costs you.
He gave Madame Oreille a slip of paper; she took it, got up and went out, thanking him, for she was in a hurry to escape lest he should change his mind.
She went briskly through the streets, looking out for a really good umbrella maker, and when she found a shop, which appeared to be a first-class one, she went in, and said, confidently:
I want this umbrella re-covered in silk, good silk.
Use the very best and strongest you have.
I dont mind what it costs.
