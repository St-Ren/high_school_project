Two Essays1. The Delights of Books. °@°@Books are to mankind2 what memory is to the individual. They contain the history of our race, the discoveries we have made, the accumulated3 knowledge and experience of ages; they picture for us the marvels4 and beauties5 of nature, help us in our difficulties, comfort6 us in sorrow and in suffering, change hours of weariness7 into moments of delight, store our minds with ideas, fill them with good and happy thoughts, and lift us out of and above ourselves. °@°@When we read, we may not only be kings and live in palaces, but, what is far better, we may transport ourselves to the mountains or the seashore8, and visit the most beautiful parts of the earth, without fatigue9, inconvenience10, or expense11. Precious12 and priceless13 are the blessings14 which books scatter15 around our daily paths. We walk, in imagination, with the noblest16 spirits, through the most sublime1 and enchanting regions. °@°@Macaulay2 had wealth and fame17, rank and power, and yet he tells us in his biography18 that he owed19 the happiest hours of his life to books. In a charming letter to a little girl, he says: °ßIf anyone would make me the greatest king that ever lived, with palaces and gardens and fine dinners, and wines and coaches3, and beautiful clothes, and hundreds of servants20, on condition that I should not read books, I would not be a king. I would rather be a poor man in a garret4 with plenty of books than a king who did not love reading.°® Youth. °@°@Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy1 cheeks21, red lips and supple7 knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality22 of the imagination, a vigor23 of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs24 of life. °@°@Youth means the predominance8 of courage over timidity25; of adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of sixty more than in a boy of twenty. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting26 our ideals. °@°@Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, doubt, self-distrust27, fear, and despair28°Xthese are the long, long years that bow the head and turn the growing spirit back to dust. °@°@Whether sixty or sixteen, there is in every human being°¶s heart the love of wonder, the sweet amazement of the stars and the star-like things, the undaunted9 challenge of events, the unfailing29 child-like appetite30 for what comes next, and the joy of the game of living. °@°@You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your self-confidence31, as old as your fear; as young as your hope, as old as your despair. 
How Good Is Your Memory? °@°@Some people have extraordinary1 memories. According to the Guinness1 World Records, 2001, Gert Mittring2 of Germany can look at a list of twenty-two numbers for just four seconds and remember all of them. Most people, though, have trouble at times remembering where they put their door keys, or recalling the names of people they°¶ve recently met for the first time. °@°@The process by which we store and retrieve2 information in our brains3 has been the focus of scientific research for many years. The brain is a highly complex organ that is not fully understood, and theories regarding how it works remain a topic4 of debate. It is generally agreed, though, that one area of the brain known as the hippocampus3°Xnamed after the Latin4 word for °ßseahorse5°® because of its curved5 shape°Xis important in the process of recalling information. °@°@When we experience something, the information is transmitted6 via7 our senses to the hippocampus, where it is processed. °@°@Although the process of creating memories is only partially8 understood, it is thought to involve three main steps. Scientists believe that brain cells called neurons6 first transform9 the sensory10 stimuli11 we experience into images in our immediate memory. Then, these images are sent to the hippocampus and stored temporarily in short-term memory. In the hippocampus, information is organized, and it is during this process that parts of the image of our experience fade away. Finally, certain information is then transferred to long-term memory in a section in the frontal7 lobe8 of the brain known as the cerebral9 cortex10. Scientists think this process may happen while we are sleeping, but exactly how the information is transferred from one area of the brain to another is a mystery.    Although memory function is difficult to understand and analyze, memory loss is something that many people experience and worry about as they age. In the past, neuroscientists11 believed that age-related memory impairment12 was associated with total numbers of brain cells. The theory was that the brain contained a finite13 number of irreplaceable14 neurons, and as we got older, we used up our stock15 of available cells. More recent research suggests that this may not be so and that neurogenesis12, or the manufacture of new brain cells, may take place throughout a lifetime. Also, there is now evidence that damage to the hippocampus may play an important role in memory loss. Studies conducted16 on patients who have suffered damage to this area of the brain show that while they can still recall memories stored before the brain was damaged, they are unable to remember new facts. In addition, diseases associated with old age, such as Alzheimer°¶s13, and other problems involving short- and long-term memory loss, are now being traced to possible damage to the hippocampus. °@°@Research suggests that the power to retrieve information can be influenced by food and sleep. Vitamin E is, for example, able to break down chemicals, known as free radicals, that are thought to cause irreparable14 damage to brain cells. Studies suggest that eating foods containing vitamin E, such as green vegetables, is one way of curtailing17 age-related memory loss. Though there is no definitive18 proof, there are others who believe that herbs19 such as ginseng15 and ginkgo16 help to enhance20 both concentration21 and memory retention22. Research on short-term memory indicates that getting a good night°¶s sleep can also help one to recollect23 things more clearly.    Although the exact process by which memories are coded and retrieved remains a mystery, there is no doubt that eating the right foods and getting sufficient amounts of sleep can help us make the best use of our brain°¶s remarkable24 ability to store and recall information. 
The Heat Is On. °@°@It has been estimated by some scientists that up to a third of all species of life on Earth could be extinct by 2050. For this potential catastrophe1, they put the blame squarely2 on global warming. Higher temperatures are already having a marked3 effect on the natural world. In many areas, plants are flowering earlier in the spring than usual, and animal breeding patterns1 have been disrupted2. °@°@Of greater concern to humans are the heat waves4 and the increasing number of devastating storms. At various times over the past decade, people have died because of extremely high temperatures in Italy, Greece, Russia, and other countries. In the past few years, terrible storms have also brought destruction to different parts of the world. Hurricane Katrina5, for instance, caused massive damage and misery3 in the city of New Orleans6 in 2005, and Typhoon Morakot7 brought great loss of life to southern Taiwan in 2009. What°¶s worse, an even bigger disaster could be lying in wait: the possibility of rising sea levels. °@°@This trend4 towards higher temperatures is thought to be the result of a stronger °ßgreenhouse effect8.°® This term refers to the way the Earth retains5 heat from the sun. It is part of a natural process in which carbon dioxide9 and other greenhouse gases help trap6 the sun°¶s energy. However, in recent decades, the amount of greenhouse gases in the Earth°¶s atmosphere7 has increased. This is due to human activities such as industry and the burning of fossil fuels10. As a result, more energy is trapped in the atmosphere, causing the planet to warm up. The problem is made worse by deforestation, since trees absorb carbon dioxide. °@°@No one can be certain about the actual consequences of global warming. Some scientists have predicted that the average8 temperature of the Earth could increase by one to six degrees Celsius11 by the end of this century. If the latter number is more accurate9, the outcome10 could be catastrophic. It could result in the melting11 of the polar12 ice caps, causing rises in sea levels that could wipe out many coastal cities. Taiwan°¶s low-lying regions, where most of its people live, could end up under water. Not all experts13 are predicting such disaster, but the majority accept that the effects of climate change will be severe. °@°@For one thing, climate change will certainly alter14 many of the world°¶s habitats and ecosystems12. Some places depend on a delicate balance of weather and soil15 conditions16 which could easily be upset, resulting in a serious threat to many living things. In the past, climate change took place over a long period of time, and plants and animals were able to slowly adapt to the new conditions. In recent years, extreme weather has occurred so often that both plants and animals have encountered disasters. If future climate change takes place as quickly as some scientists have predicted, many species, both on land and in the oceans, will be unable to react quickly enough to survive. °@°@Human beings will also suffer from climate change, whether they live near the sea or not. It will affect people°¶s health both directly and indirectly. Some of the direct effects will be the greater risk of heat stress13 and other related problems that can result from high temperatures and excessive17 humidity18. Indirect effects of climate change, such as increased air pollution and changes in food and water supplies, will also have a severe impact19 on human health. Poor countries will not have the resources to prevent or treat such health problems, and this means that the most vulnerable people will be children and the elderly in developing regions. °@°@So what can be done about the problem? At the political level, there have been international meetings and promises made by many governments to reduce greenhouse gases. However, climate conferences20 in Japan (1997), Denmark (2009), and Mexico (2010) have yielded21 mixed results, mainly because there is much disagreement over the right measures to take. Still, prominent22 people like former U.S. Vice President Al Gore14 continue to campaign23 vigorously for more effective action. °@°@In the meantime, there is much that ordinary people can do to fight global warming. They can try to reduce their so-called carbon footprint15 by consuming less energy. Even a high school student like you can cut down on your electricity24 use. You can always turn lights and appliances25 off when you don°¶t need them, for example. And cycling or walking to school can lead to a small reduction in gasoline26 consumption. Every little bit helps. 
The Tomato Festival. °@°@On the last Wednesday of August every year, the town of Bunol1, Valencia2, in Spain, becomes the stage for the world°¶s largest food fight. Up to fifty thousand tourists flood the town to take part in the traditional tomato fight, which lasts from around midday1 until 1 p.m. An estimated 150,000 tomatoes are thrown, kicked, and splattered2, covering everything and everyone with red pulp3 and seeds.  °@°@The festival began in 1945, but nobody knows for sure why. Some claim that the first tomato fight took place among a small group of friends and that the event snowballed3 from there. Others say its origin was political and that the first tomatoes were thrown by townspeople4 unhappy with the performance of their local city council4. A third theory is that the first tomato fight resulted from an angry confrontation5 between the giant figures in a carnival6 parade7 and the local kids. Anyway, whatever its origin, °ßLa Tomatina5,°® as it is now called, is one of the most popular and bizarre8 festivals in Europe. °@°@The week-long festival features music, dancing, parades, and other fun activities. On the evening before the actual fight starts, there is a huge paella6-cooking contest9. Then, on the day of the tomato battle, before the tomato throwing begins, members of the crowd attempt to climb a tall greasy10 pole, on the top of which is a ham. This can take a while as the climbers slip and slide on the pole. Only when someone successfully retrieves11 the ham can the tomato fight begin. °@°@Early Wednesday morning, shopkeepers along the plaza7 set about covering their windows and doors in preparation for the messy attack. The start of the fight is signaled by the firing of water cannons8, and trucks carrying the tomatoes pull into the town. The tomatoes are specially grown nearby and don°¶t taste good, presumably12 so that nobody is tempted13 to eat them instead of throwing them. In the fight itself there are no rules except that fighters should crush the tomatoes before throwing them. Many people wear goggles9 to keep tomato juice out of their eyes. At 1 p.m., the water cannons are fired again and the battle ends. Then the cleanup14 begins, with fire trucks hosing down the streets, the buildings, and the people! °@°@It°¶s clear that everyone in Bunol has a terrific time at the tomato festival. It°¶s good, messy fun, and participants can enjoy a really good food fight. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe inexplicable have always been a charm to the human mind. There are ancient myths, legends, and mysteries in history that were beyond human understanding. The curse of Tutankhamun* is one of the most famous mysteries in the early 2th century. The boy king ruled Egypt for nine years before dying mysteriously at the age of nineteen. It was said that the pharaoh was assassinated and that all records of his existence were wiped out, and there was no trace of his tomb until 3, years later. But once his tomb was discovered, a series of inexplicable deaths and events followed. They made people notice the curse of Tutankhamun, a spell that anyone who dared to disturb the peace of the dead would be doomed.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn 1, when a search team led by Howard Carter* opened the tomb of Tutankhamun, they were ecstatic. Little did they know then that this act would seal the fates of many. Immediately after the opening of the tomb, the canary* Carter kept in his home was swallowed by a cobra*, the symbol of Egyptian monarchy*. A few weeks later, Lord Carnarvon*, who had financed the digging, died of infection due to a mosquito bite. What was even more hair-raising was that the mosquito bite on Carnarvon‚Äôs cheek was in the same position where the mummified* face of the pharaoh had a distinguishable mark. Then, moments before Carnarvon died, the city of Cairo* was plunged into darkness as all the lights went out. Other unnatural deaths followed. An archeologist* on the team suddenly went into a coma* and died. Carnarvon‚Äôs friend died of fever after visiting the tomb. The researcher studying the mummified figure of Tutankhamun also died under mysterious circumstances soon afterwards.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThis series of misfortunes made many people believe that the tomb of Tutankhamun was indeed cursed. A newspaper report mentioned that a curse was found written on the inside of the sarcophagus*: ‚ÄúDeath shall come on swift wings to him who disturbs the peace of the King.‚Äù Although this writing was nowhere to be found later on, the idea of a curse began to take shape. Many people were convinced that the unnatural deaths were a clear sign that the wheels of fate had started rolling for those who had dared to open the tomb. „ÄÄ„ÄÄOn the other hand, many skeptics have pointed out that the deaths could be the result of a deadly fungus* growing in the enclosed tomb. Recent studies have shown that high-level toxic gases are present inside similar tombs. These could have poisoned those who entered the tomb. Some also claim that the idea of a curse could well have been fueled by the media. In order to boost sales, all that the media needed to do was spread a fitting rumor. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe fact is that only six members of the original team died within the first decade of the discovery. Howard Carter, the man responsible for the find, lived another seventeen years and died a natural death. Carnarvon‚Äôs daughter, one of the first to enter the tomb, lived to the ripe old age of eighty. The team‚Äôs photographer, the researcher who had studied the inscriptions*, and many others lived for more than two decades after the opening of the tomb. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAlthough there are many explanations, none of them is definitive. We may choose to believe the curse or provide our own explanations based on the evidence gathered, but the mystery around Pharaoh Tutankhamun will remain.  
Making Scents of Perfume. °@°@Do you know what happened when archeologists unsealed the tomb of King Tut, the Egyptian Pharaoh? To their surprise, no sooner had they unsealed the tomb than an aroma that they would never forget came out of it. From the remains of the neatly wrapped mummy, delicate pottery gave off a soft scent. The scent the archeologists had discovered came from a kind of incense. This was the most famous Egyptian fragrance and the oldest evidence of perfume so far discovered. °@°@Egyptians associated incense with godliness. By filling rooms with it, they believed that the gods would look more favorably on them. In fact, they were so obsessed with fragrance that they bathed in oil mixed with aromatic plants as well as other spices.  °@°@During the eleventh century, an Arabian doctor discovered how to obtain oil directly from plants and flowers through distillation. This method of evaporating water led to more complicated mixtures and more subtle scents, and offered more precise control over the results. °@°@Perfume was gradually transformed from a religious product into a vanity product that symbolized wealth, prestige, and most importantly, beauty. People just couldn°¶t get enough of it°Xfood was flavored with rose perfumes, drinks tasted of lilies, and coffee was brewed with jasmine. People even soaked their clothing in perfume and sprayed their furniture and rugs with it! °@°@By the end of the nineteenth century, people had started to use synthetic substances because of the high costs of obtaining natural ingredients to make fragrances. This reduced costs and paved the way for commercial sales. To ensure the quality of each artificial smell, experts known as perfumers were born. A perfumer, also called a °ßnose,°® is an artist who is trained to detect the subtlest differences between fragrances. °@°@Perfumers are also capable of associating abstract concepts and moods with fragrance compositions. Sometimes perfumes are formulated to smell like nature, with floral or woody ingredients, and sometimes like an abstract concept such as °ßobsession°® or a °ßlove spell.°® °@°@In order to preserve all of the wonderfully created scents, something equally wonderful was needed. Egyptians originally kept perfume in pottery. After glass was developed, people considered it the perfect material for making perfume bottles. °@°@Perfume and perfume bottles go together like humans and their souls. Each bottle is a physical manifestation of the finely crafted fragrance within. A light-purple bottle with a crystal butterfly on top captures the carefree feeling of playing in a meadow of lavender. A stylish bottle that mimics a beautiful gown gives the impression that an elegant lady may apply this fragrance to her neck and wrists. °@°@Today there is a wide variety of perfumes to choose from. There are bold musky fragrances for men and sophisticated floral scents for ladies. Even fruits are being used to create sweet aromas for everyday use and to attract younger customers. Many celebrities are also creating fragrances for their fans to wear°X scents the celebrities feel best represent them. To select the perfume that is perfect for you, simply close your eyes and follow your nose. 
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄOn a quiet October night in 1957, the residents of Coalwood1 gathered in a field staring1 at the measureless2 universe. They were tracing a small spot of light moving across the night sky. It was the first satellite3 , Sputnik2, launched by the Russians3. When the light scratched4 the dark sky, it sowed5 a seed for a dream in a boy‚Äôs mind. „ÄÄ„ÄÄLocated6 in West Virginia, Coalwood, as the name suggests, was a coal7 town. In the 1950s, all the boys in Coalwood seemed to be destined8 to work in the mine. The only way to escape9 from the gray town was to enter college with a football scholarship. However, Homer Hickam10 was neither strong nor tough10 enough to be a football player. He was doomed11 to lead his life in the underground12 world.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄEverything changed when Homer saw Sputnik crossing the sky. So inspired by the experience, he became determined to build a rocket13 himself. He enthusiastically shared his thoughts with his family, but laughter was   the only response he got.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ Homer started to look up information in the library, but soon he realized it was too difficult for him to accomplish the task alone14. So, he convinced15 three friends to work on the project with him. In a short time, they finished the first model16, but it only exploded. In each experiment, they made many mistakes, but fortunately, they got help from many people in the town.  With their help,  product was no longer merely17 an explosive. However, even though it started to take off, it wouldn‚Äôt fly straight. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAround this time, Homer‚Äôs father was hurt in a mine accident. To support the family, Homer was forced to drop out of school and work in the mine. The plan to build a rocket was terminated18, and so was Homer‚Äôs dream. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ Even in the hardest times, Mrs. Riley5, Homer‚Äôs science teacher, did not give up on Homer. She continued to encourage him to pursue19 his dream. Eventually, Homer knew it was time to leave the mine, go back to school, and fulfill20 his dream. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ Homer‚Äôs father was disappointed with Homer‚Äôs decision.  He thought Homer had inherited21 his talent and would  be a great miner6. They had a fierce22 argument, and  Homer‚Äôs father knew his son was going to leave  him eventually, like the rocket flying high into  the sky. „ÄÄ„ÄÄHomer‚Äôs rocket design23 improved a lot, and he showed it at the National Science Fair. The judges were impressed24 with his work and Homer won first place. Homer could not believe that his dream was coming true. „ÄÄ„ÄÄWith excitement25 Homer went back to Coalwood, and before leaving home for college, he prepared a special rocket launch to thank those who had helped him. He invited his father, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to believe that I‚Äôve got it in me to be somebody in this world. It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm different from you. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm the same as you.‚Äù But, Homer wasn‚Äôt sure if his father would come for the launch. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn the end, however, Homer‚Äôs father showed up and even pushed the launch button26. As the rocket went high up into the sky, he proudly27 put his arm around Homer‚Äôs shoulder, knowing his son was aiming as high. 	
Unit 9  The Wonderful World of Hayao Miyazaki. 	Many people have heard of Hayao Miyazaki, a gifted Japanese animator, and his internationally acclaimed films. His films, such as My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, and Howl°¶s Moving Castle, have captured the interest of people of all ages around the world. However, when it comes to the elements found in his films, most people probably don°¶t know that many of these elements actually date back to Miyazaki°¶s childhood. 	One distinctive characteristic of Miyazaki°¶s films is the presence of strong female characters. Take Chihiro, the ten-year-old main character in Spirited Away, for example. Separated from her parents and forced to face numerous monsters and witches, she must share her love so that she can overcome several obstacles and save her parents. Chihiro°¶s adventure transforms her from a spoiled, whiny child into a responsible, capable girl, and the whole process is similar to the maturation that occurred in Miyazaki°¶s life. 	When Miyazaki was about six, his mother contracted tuberculosis. Her treatment continued during his teenage years, and this meant that Miyazaki had to care for his two younger brothers. As a result, Miyazaki drew pictures and made up stories to entertain them. Gradually, he developed keen drawing skills, a fertile imagination, and the ability to convey stories through images. But for his unusual childhood circumstances, Miyazaki might never have gone on creating so many entrancing animated films. 	Another early influence on Miyazaki was the work of his father and uncle in the aviation industry. As he was a child, Miyazaki spent hours drawing planes. This led to his lifelong interest in flying. After he started to create his own works, flying naturally became a recurring theme. Miyazaki°¶s various flying vehicles include a witch°¶s broom, massive military vessels, and so on°Xoften with emphasis on designs that were never, or could never be, possible in real life. Without his early exposure to aviation, Miyazaki would not have been so inspired by flying. 	Miyazaki°¶s films stand out also because his characters reflect reality. The characters of Miyazaki°¶s films, unlike those of most typical Hollywood animated films, are neither completely righteous nor completely wicked, which is very true to life and makes his films one of a kind. As a story unfolds, villains reveal certain positive traits, as well as their violence, evil, and hatred. Good and bad fuse together, and the tension between them gives richness and complexity to Miyazaki°¶s stories. These stories illustrate that there are always positive things worth living for: joy to be found, a peaceful resolution to be attempted, and love to be embraced. 	With these unique characteristics, Miyazaki°¶s films have not only achieved commercial success in Japan, but also won praise from moviegoers and critics alike around the world. At the ceremony for the 2002 Academy Awards, the award for Best Animated Feature went to Spirited Away, the first Japanese animated film ever to win an Oscar. Renowned as an imaginative animator, Miyazaki has remained true to his own ideals and beliefs, which are expressed in each of his extraordinary productions. Without a doubt, he will keep on leaving audiences in awe with the wonderful worlds he creates in his works. °XBy Barbara Cromarty
°@°@Cloud computing1 is the hot new buzzword2 in technology these days.  But who knew the killer app3 for this brave1 new world would be plain old e-mail? Yet that is exactly what°¶s happening.  °ßE-mail has become the easiest workload2 for customers to move to the cloud,°® says Chris Capossela4, a senior vice3 president at Microsoft5.  °@°@What this shift4 means, basically, is that instead of buying your own computer servers and paying a team of techies6 to run your e-mail system, you can instead rent e-mail as a service. Microsoft¢wor Google7 or IBM8¢wruns your e-mail system on its servers5, taking care of security, software updates6, and bugs. It°¶s the first step in a larger shift in which, over the next decade, much of the computing that takes place in corporate7 data8 centers will migrate9 out onto10 the cloud. As it unfolds11, it could create new winners and losers among big tech companies. °@°@Microsoft reckons12 that the average customer can save 30 percent on e-mail by moving to the cloud. A company with 1,000 employees might spend $2 million a year on e-mail, so the savings are significant. Proponents13 say cloud-based1 mail is not only cheaper but also better. With cloud-based mail each user can have huge amounts of storage space14¢w25 gigabytes9 or more¢wwhile a traditional °ßon-premises10°® e-mail system might allow users only 100 megabytes11. °@°@Rexel12, a French distributor15 of electrical equipment16, expects to cut its e-mail costs by one third by moving its employees from a hodgepodge13 of systems to a single cloud-based one, operated by Microsoft. So far Rexel has shifted 4,000 of its 28,000 employees to a cloud version of Microsoft Exchange14 and plans to get everyone moved over as soon as possible. °@°@Microsoft wasn°¶t the first to offer cloud-based mail to corporate customers: it had to play catch-up17 with Google. But for companies already using Exchange, it°¶s often easier to move employees to the cloud version of what they already know than to switch them over to a new system. Serena15, a software company in California16, last year went from on-premises Exchange to Google°¶s Gmail17 but is migrating again, to the cloud-based version of Exchange, mostly because its employees are more familiar with it. °ßMaking the change to Google was gut-wrenching18 for a lot of people,°® says Ron Brister19, Serena°¶s director of IT20. °ßPeople just weren°¶t getting used to it.°® °@°@Microsoft sees the cloud as a competitive weapon18, a chance to pull customers away from rivals19 like IBM, which sells an on-premises messaging system called Notes. °ßCustomers are using the cloud as a way to move to Microsoft,°® Capossela says, citing20 new customers like GlaxoSmithKline21, and Kraft Foods22. But wait¢wIBM claims21 it°¶s doing the same thing right back to Microsoft. IBM sells a cloud-based mail solution called LotusLive iNotes23 and has lured22 away from Microsoft such customers as Panasonic24, which is moving 300,000 employees onto an IBM cloud. °@°@There is one thing Microsoft, Google, and IBM all agree on: the battle over cloud computing is only just beginning. For old-guard tech companies, it offers the chance to add new customers. But it also brings big risks: during big shifts in technology like this one, industry giants can be swept aside23 as new leaders emerge. Ten years from now, the tech landscape is certain to look very different.  
Unit 4 The Teacher Who Changed My Life. 	The person who shaped the course of my life was a schoolteacher named Marjorie Hurd. When I stepped off a ship in New York Harbor on a gray March day in 1949, I was a nine-year-old war refugee, who had lost his mother and was coming to live with the father he did not know. My mother, Eleni Gatzoyiannis, had been imprisoned, tortured, and shot by Communist guerrillas for sending my sisters and me to freedom. 	I was thirteen years old when I entered Chandler Junior High. Shortly after I arrived, I was told to select a hobby to pursue during °ßclub hours.°® The idea of hobbies and clubs made no sense to my immigrant ears, but I decided to follow the prettiest girl in my class. She led me into the presence of Miss Hurd, the school newspaper adviser and English teacher who would become my mentor and my muse. 	A formidable woman with gray hair and steely eyes, Miss Hurd had no patience with the lazy. °ßIf there°¶s anybody in this room who doesn°¶t like to work, I suggest he or she go across to the glee club now, because you°¶re going to work your tails off here!°® she roared. I was soon under Miss Hurd°¶s spell. She drilled us in grammar, assigned stories for us to read and discuss, and eventually taught us how to put out a newspaper. Her introduction to the literary wealth of Greece gave me a new perspective on my war-ravaged homeland, making me proud of my origins. Her efforts spurred me on to understand the logic and structure of the English language. Owing to her inspiration, during my next twenty-five years, I became a journalist by profession. 	One day, she made us compose an essay from our own experience. Fixing me with a stern look, she added, °ßNick, I want you to write about what happened to your family in Greece.°® I had been trying to put those painful memories behind me, and I left the assignment until the last moment. Then, on a warm spring afternoon, I sat in my room with a pad and pencil. I started to write, one line after another, telling how the Communist guerrillas occupied our village, how my mother planned escape with my sisters and me, and how, at the last moment, she could not get away with us because the guerrillas sent her to a distant village. 	I wrote about that particular nighttime escape across fields and into lines of soldiers, who had then sent us to a refugee camp. It was there that my sisters and I learned of our mother°¶s execution. I felt very lucky to have come to America, I concluded, but every year, the coming of spring always reminded me of the last time I saw my mother on a green and gold day in 1948. 	Miss Hurd had the essay published in the school paper. This humiliated me, until I saw that my classmates reacted with sympathy to my family°¶s story. Miss Hurd also submitted the essay to a contest, and it won a medal. The local paper wrote about the award. My father was ecstatic with pride, and the Greek community celebrated the honor to one of its own. For the first time, I began to understand the power of the written word. 	Meanwhile, I followed the literary path that Miss Hurd had so forcefully set me on. In high school, I became an editor of my school paper and got a part-time job at a local newspaper. Although my father could only offer me $50 and encouragement toward a college education, I managed to finance four years at Boston University with scholarships and part-time jobs in journalism. 	When I graduated, it was Miss Hurd who attended the ceremony with my father and shared our joy. She was also one of the first to call me on December 10, 1987, while President Reagan was delivering a television speech after a summit meeting with Gorbachev. President Reagan told the nation that Eleni Gatzoyiannis°¶s dying cry of °ßMy children!°® had helped inspire him to seek an arms agreement °ßfor all the children of the world.°® 	°ßI can°¶t imagine a better monument to your mother,°® Miss Hurd said with an uncharacteristic catch in her voice. 	Miss Hurd retired at the age of 62. By then, she had taught for a total of 41 years. Even after her retirement, though, she continually made a °ßproject°® of some stubborn students in whom she spied a spark of potential. The students were mainly from the most troubled homes, yet she would alternately bully and charm them with her own special brand of tough love, until their spark caught fire. 	Miss Hurd was the one who directed my grief and pain into writing. Had it not been for Miss Hurd, I wouldn°¶t have become a reporter, recording the story of my mother°¶s life and death in Greece. She was the catalyst that sent me into journalism and indirectly caused all the good things in my life that came after. Miss Hurd, however, would probably deny this emphatically. °XAdapted from °ßThe Teacher Who Changed My Life°® by Nicholas Gage, from Parade, December 17, 1989.
Unit 8 Modern-Day Pirates. 	Are there any pirates today? Surprisingly, the answer is yes. The romantic images many of us have in our minds of pirates wearing eye patches with parrots on their shoulders may be out-of-date, but each year hundreds of pirate attacks are committed on international shipping routes. 	Most of the piracy undertaken today is extremely high-tech. Pirates use sophisticated tools, like radar, to locate ships that are vulnerable to attack. Smaller acts of piracy include boarding pleasure boats and stealing from them, often after murdering the owners and throwing their corpses into the water. Larger thefts include diverting entire tankers into a secret port, where oil or other precious commodities are unloaded and later sold. 	Using other kinds of technology, law enforcement officials are finding ways to stop piracy or at least catch pirates in the act. For example, many ships are now equipped with an unobtrusive alarm system. A hidden button sets off an automatic message system alerting the ship°¶s owner as well as marine authorities that something bad or illegal is happening. For added security, this message can°¶t be detected by someone on board or even by other ships nearby. 	Many larger ships are often attacked by small boats with pirates using ladders to ascend the walls of the ship, climb on board, and hold the crew hostage. To prohibit such attacks, a simple fence can be installed all around a ship, complete with a 9,000-volt charge to shock pirates trying to board. With any contact, this system will also set off alarms and activate floodlights. 	Nevertheless, piracy on the high seas is far less common than the everyday piracy of intellectual property that many of us practice these days. Intellectual property refers to ideas. Increasingly, developed countries°¶ economies are dependent more on their ideas than on their natural resources. 	Those who have done one of the following things may be considered to be pirates or to have at least helped pirates: 	°Ebought or used illegal software 	°Ebought or used illegal CDs 	°Edownloaded copyright music without paying 	°Emade photocopies of a magazine or book 	In practical terms, using illegal software or engaging in any of the other illegal acts mentioned above can lead to three downsides. The first is that the cost of piracy adds to the cost of the product. If a thousand copies of something are sold for a certain amount of money and another thousand copies are pirated, then the price of this product will likely have to be doubled in order for the authorized sellers to make the same profit. 	The second issue is that piracy discourages innovation. People who create software, for instance, can become discouraged by the high degree of software piracy. They may stop creating new software because they consider it a waste of time. This could lead to a situation in which no one would want to work, especially if he or she were underpaid or didn°¶t get paid at all. 	Thirdly, intellectual property piracy creates a culture in which it is acceptable to use things without paying. People who, for example, download music illegally from the Internet may have an increasing disrespect for paying for any kind of intellectual property. In many countries, illegal copies and pirated goods are even sold by gangsters. Are these the sorts of people that should be supported? 	To defend itself against piracy, the intellectual property industry has been trying to tackle this problem by using several approaches, including education, legal prosecution, copy protection, and concessions: °EEducation involves making people aware of the problems associated with intellectual property piracy. °ELegal prosecution involves making examples of some individuals and organizations that violate intellectual property rights. °ECopy protection measures have been introduced on many forms of software, music, and videos to make them more difficult to copy and disperse. °EConcessions have also been made by the intellectual property industry. For example, many software companies now offer student discounts, and music downloads are now available at reasonable prices. 	It seems clear that today°¶s pirates have good reasons to stop stealing and obey the law. °XAdapted from °ßModern Day Pirates,°® Read and Think!
Unit 9 To a Daughter Leaving Home. 	Linda Pastan, a contemporary American poet, has authored more than a dozen books of poetry and received many awards and honors, including being named Poet Laureate of Maryland from 1991 to 1995. Pastan sensitively portrays everyday events in her poems to explore themes such as life and death, love and loss, pain and sickness, and joy and sorrow. Her style is deceptively simple, and unlike some other poets, she rarely preaches in her poems. She likes understatement, often speaking in a soft voice, as if she were talking to an intimate friend. Known for her perfectionism, she constantly revises her poems. Her creed for life is to work hard, love family and friends with all her heart and soul, and attempt to enjoy this short existence to the fullest. 	°ßTo a Daughter Leaving Home°® 	by Linda Pastan When I taught you at eight to ride a bicycle, loping along beside you as you wobbled away on two round wheels, my own mouth rounding in surprise when you pulled ahead down the curved path of the park, I kept waiting for the thud of your crash as I sprinted to catch up, while you grew smaller, more breakable with distance, pumping, pumping for your life, screaming with laughter, the hair flapping behind you like a handkerchief waving goodbye. 	Reading this very moving poem written in the form of free verse, one can easily sense the mother°¶s anxiety about her eight-year-old daughter possibly falling off the bike. This contrasts strikingly with the little girl°¶s excited reaction to her newly acquired skill, which gives her mobility, enables her to expand her horizons, and, consequently, equips her with greater independence. The poet not only sensitively captures two opposing states of mind, but also skillfully makes riding a bike a symbol of independence. 	The poem°¶s emotional tension subtly exemplifies a paradox. Although parents are willing to take on the burden of educating their children to become independent, they are often reluctant to give their children free rein in case the children should end up hurting themselves. In addition, they are often fearful that their children are not ready for independence, just as these telling lines remind us: °ßyou grew / smaller, more breakable / with distance.°® Out of love, many parents find themselves yearning to protect their children, while simultaneously endeavoring to teach them how to live without their protection. 	The child in the poem feels completely differently about the situation. She is shown °ßpumping°® for her life, with all her energy, and as she pedals away from her mother, she shouts and laughs to celebrate this great breakthrough, a milestone in her life. When she pulls away unsteadily, her flapping hair seems to wave goodbye to her mother in triumph. 	At first glance, the title of this poem seems unrelated to the event in the poem. The poem is a reminiscence of an incident that happened a long time ago, when the daughter was a little girl still living at home. However, the title of the poem specifically refers to the grown-up daughter getting ready to leave home. The mother, addressing her older daughter, says nothing sentimental about the current prospect of their parting. However, remembering this particular experience, she learns a profound lesson about her relationship with her child. It is not until that moment, when the daughter is ready to depart, that the reality dawns on her former guardian: The young girl has been getting ready all along for this day of departure. What such a caring and conscientious mother might have to say is, perhaps, °ßIt°¶s time for you to be on your own. Goodbye, and good luck!°® °Xfrom Carnival Evening: New and Selected Poems 1968-1998 by Linda Pastan; interpreted by Yen-sheng Hsia.
