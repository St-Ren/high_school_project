Robert Frost and His Poems.      Robert Frost1 (1874-1963) is probably the best-known American poet of the twentieth century. He won almost every major literary1 award and honor, received numerous2 honorary degrees, and was invited to teach at many top universities. He was offered the Congressional Gold Medal2 in 1960 and invited to read his poems at President Kennedy°¶s3 inauguration3. For nearly half a century he was the unofficial4 poet laureate of America, and his poems have been widely read around the world.       Frost°¶s interest and talent5 in poetry can be traced back to his boyhood6. As the son of an elementary school teacher, he used to sit in his mother°¶s classroom and memorize long passages7 of prose8 and poetry, and thus grew to love language and literature. He published his first poem in 1894, but it was not until his stay in England from 1912 to 1915 that he gained9 public recognition as a poet. After returning from England, he lived most of the rest of his life in rural10 New England. The walks that he took on his farm allowed him to observe the details of nature and the rural landscape: the flowers and leaves, the streams and brooks, the changing seasons. Such images, described in simple and direct language, became a hallmark11 of his poetry.  °@°@The rural environment that Frost knew and loved also included a strong human presence12. In fact, it is his awareness of man°¶s relationship with nature that brings us some of Frost°¶s most memorable13 images°Ximages that not only move us with their serene beauty, but also inspire us by addressing14 universal questions of life. In °ßThe Road Not Taken,°® for example, the poet presents a traveler walking through the autumn woods who comes to a fork in the road; his decision about which way to go becomes a metaphor15 for the major turning points that a person confronts in life. In another poem, °ßStopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,°® a rider4 on horseback contemplates16 whether he should stop and enjoy the beautiful winter scenery or continue home, his dilemma17 reflecting the universal struggle between freedom and duty18. To his regret, the rider realizes that before he can enjoy his freedom, he must fulfill his responsibilities19. As we can see, common human experiences, with Frost°¶s unique touch, are elevated20 to a level of profound21 meaning. To this day, his poems continue to touch the hearts of readers everywhere.                                                            °Xby Sarah Brooks The Road Not Taken Two roads diverged22 in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent23 in the undergrowth5; Then took the other, as just as fair6, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy7 and wanted wear24; Though as for that, the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally25 lay In leaves no step had trodden26 black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence27: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I°X I took the one less traveled by,      And that has made all the difference.       Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; He will not see me stopping here To watch his woods fill up with snow. My little horse must think it queer28 To stop without a farmhouse8 near Between the woods and frozen lake The darkest evening of the year. He gives his harness29 bells a shake To ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound°¶s the sweep Of easy wind and downy9 flake10. The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.                                 °Xby Robert Frost, from The Poetry of Robert Frost 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI‚Äôm standing here at the finish line of today‚Äôs marathon in Taipei, where more than 4, participants are in a frenzy of excitement as they enjoy a great feeling of solidarity.  Everywhere I look there are panting runners drenched in sweat, and spectators are shouting out words of encouragement to those who are just finishing.  What a scene!  The atmosphere is heating up here, not because of the weather, but because of the outburst of enthusiasm.‚Äù  This reporter definitely got one thing right: the marathon is truly a remarkable sport.  But most people don‚Äôt realize that this increasingly popular activity goes all the way back to ancient times.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe marathon is a long-distance race named after the Greek* town where the sport originated.  In 4 B.C., Greece was invaded by the Persians*.  The residents of the capital city, Athens*, had no idea that their army had already defeated the Persians nearby at Marathon until one man, Pheidippides*, had run the whole way from that town to inform them.  Legend has it that he ran into the Senate* and bellowed ‚ÄúVictory!‚Äù before falling down on the floor and dying from exhaustion.  To honor that legendary runner, a long-distance race was held from the Marathon Bridge to the Olympic* Stadium in Athens when the first modern Olympic Games were held in 1.  Since then, the sport has continued to attract runners of all ages around the world. „ÄÄ„ÄÄMost new runners are attracted to the sport because it is a great way to lose weight and keep in shape.  Running also provides them with an outlet for their excess energy and allows them to relieve their stress.  But as runners build up their endurance, many find that they need to run longer and longer distances to get that same feeling of satisfaction.  Some even claim they feel a ‚Äúrunner‚Äôs high,‚Äù perhaps the result of chemicals released in the body during activities that require stamina* and endurance.  By running more kilometers each time, runners challenge themselves to push their bodies to the limit, and the resulting sense of accomplishment is what motivates them to participate in marathons.  Some runners become so addicted that they would rather run a marathon than compete in any other sport. „ÄÄ„ÄÄBut perhaps you may get cold feet just from the thought of signing up for a marathon.  If so, then you need to do some training to develop your confidence and strengthen your body.  Experts suggest starting small and then working your way up.  If you are only comfortable with three kilometers at first, then make that your starting point.  Set a routine, for example three times per week.  When you feel you‚Äôre ready, add another kilometer to your run.  Before long, you will be running ten kilometers, then a half marathon ( km), and finally a full marathon ( km)!  During your training, keeping a good diet is essential.  Carbohydrates* such as bananas and pasta* provide much-needed energy, and plenty of water helps the body to stay hydrated.  Overloading yourself with greasy food or too much protein is strongly discouraged because these are difficult to digest.  By following the above-mentioned tips, you will be well on your way to running your first full marathon! „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs time to finish our report on the Taipei marathon.  I must admit that I‚Äôve never even entertained the thought of running a marathon before.  But today, I witnessed all kinds of people brought together by an activity that not only increases one‚Äôs fitness but also provides a sense of achievement.  In this sport, it is not the finish line that matters but rather the journey you go on to get there.  Next time, I‚Äôm going to sign up, too!  Will I see you out there?‚Äù 
Biospheres in Space.            Will it ever be possible for people to live on faraway planets such as Mars? In the past, colonies in space were possible only in science fiction stories. Today, however, we are experimenting with ways to build real space colonies. Many scientists actually consider it possible that people will live far from the Earth sometime in the future.            The Environment Research Laboratory at the University of Arizona is one place that designs biospheres (bio means life, and a sphere is a circle, like a ball) which could be used for people to live on other planets. Biospheres are complete, enclosed environments where people can be born, live their whole lives, and die without returning to the Earth. To be successful, a biosphere has to have a perfect balance among everything within it-- the plants, the animals (including humans), and the chemical elements. Specialists and experts from many different fields are needed to work on these complex and time-consuming projects.            Building a greenhouse for growing plants in winter is the first step in creating a biosphere. A greenhouse is a closed environment except for the sun's heat entering through the glass or plastic. Of course, there is a water system from outside, and people bring in nutrients for the plants and take out the waste material. A biosphere in space will have to have its own system to provide water that can be used and reused. It will need bacteria or something else to take care of the waste. Everything must be perfectly balanced, or else the whole system will break down.            The Earth itself is the best example of a real biosphere. Nothing important enters except sunlight, and nothing leaves as waste except some heat. Everything in the Earth's environment needs to be in balance. If we destroy that balance, the system will break down.            There are several reasons for building biospheres. One reason is to help out when there is an energy shortage. Dr. Gerard K. O'Neill, a famous physicist from Princeton University, has said that in the future we will have satellites in space to produce solar energy and send it to the Earth. It will be too expensive to continually send people and materials to the satellites, so biospheres will be necessary. He thinks that ten thousand people could live in a space colony sometime in the future. There is another interesting reason to build biospheres. We can use them to do all kinds of research about our own environment and how it works. By studying biospheres, we can understand better what will happen as humans destroy tropical forests, as they create more carbon dioxide by burning fuel, and as they pollute the oceans and the air.            So far, only a few experimental biospheres have been built on Earth. One is in Oracle, Arizona, near the University of Arizona. In 1991, four men and four women tried to live inside the biosphere without getting anything from outside. During the experiment, things got out of balance. Oxygen and carbon dioxide levels fell, and the crew had to get help and supplies from outside. In space, people living in a biosphere would not be able to do this.            Learning how a biosphere works is one of the most significant things we can do. The information we get from biospheres may keep us from destroying our own environment. This information will also help us to travel where once only science fiction could go.       
In William°¶s Words. °@°@The name William Shakespeare is one of the most recognized and revered names in history. Widely known as a literary genius, the famed playwright and poet has earned such nicknames as the Bard and England°¶s national poet. His plays have been translated into every major language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Even today his creative achievements have yet to be surpassed. Still, in spite of his fame, very little is known about the man himself. °@°@It is believed that William Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford-on-Avon. As a boy, he likely attended grammar school and studied subjects like Greek and Latin literature. However, for reasons unknown, Shakespeare left school when he was fifteen and never again pursued a formal education. Just three years later, in 1582, he married Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior. Soon afterwards, they started a family. °@°@No one really knows how or when Shakespeare first began writing and acting, but by the mid-1580s his interest in these areas had gained momentum. As a result, he left Stratford-on-Avon and moved to London to pursue his dreams.  °@°@Theater was the primary source of entertainment during the Elizabethan Era, and Queen Elizabeth herself was likely one of the theater°¶s biggest patrons. It is no surprise that a superbly talented writer like Shakespeare flourished in this world. Aside from being a playwright, Shakespeare was also a well-known actor. And since the actors of the day were jacks-of-all-trades, it can be assumed that Shakespeare was also skilled in dancing, singing, doing acrobatics, and playing musical instruments. He rose to fame when he joined the Lord Chamberlain°¶s Men, an acting company protected by the queen herself. °@°@It wasn°¶t just Shakespeare°¶s acting that impressed the queen. He made quite a name for himself as a prolific writer, even during his day. His plays were often purchased and performed for large audiences in places such as the famous Globe Theatre, of which Shakespeare was part owner. Records show that the Lord Chamberlain°¶s Men performed at least two of Shakespeare°¶s plays before Queen Elizabeth and her court, further affirming Shakespeare°¶s fame and talent. Even as the plague shut down theaters all over London in the 1590s, Shakespeare continued to pen plays and poetry that would eventually make history. °@°@Credited with authoring an impressive 37 plays and 154 sonnets, Shakespeare is widely remembered for his creative achievements. However, his works are not without controversy. Some people doubt that he wrote all of the works that are credited to him and propose other people as the true authors. Theories abound that support more educated individuals as the likely writers. Most people disagree with these claims, however, instead giving Shakespeare credit where credit is due. °@°@Shakespeare°¶s plays were written in a poetic style known as blank verse. Basically, this is poetry that doesn°¶t rhyme but is still pleasing to the ear because, being mainly in iambic pentameter, it imitates the rhythms of natural speech. Blank verse is very flexible, allowing poets and playwrights to express themselves freely. Shakespeare°¶s plays fall into three categories: comedies, histories, and tragedies. Among his most famous are Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, A Midsummer Night°¶s Dream, and Antony and Cleopatra. °@°@Shakespeare°¶s genius really shows when it comes to his vocabulary. Some experts consider it a reliable estimate that he knew over 29,000 words, which would already make him virtually a genius. And when he couldn°¶t come up with an appropriate word in his writing, he invented a new one. In fact, Shakespeare coined over 1,700 words that are commonly used today in the English language, and popularized others that were already in use. Among the words credited to him are °ßamazement,°® °ßassassination,°® °ßdownstairs,°® °ßemployer,°® °ßfashionable,°® °ßsilliness,°® and °ßuseful.°® The idioms and expressions he invented include °ßbreak the ice,°® °ßcome what may,°® °ßlove is blind,°® and °ßall°¶s well that ends well.°® His plays have returned again and again to the stage and, beginning in the twentieth century, also to the screen, and so his genius continues to live on through his words. 
Mysteries of the Past. °@°@With all the vast knowledge and analytic powers of modern science, it seems there is very little that human beings do not or will not eventually know about the world. Nevertheless, there are still things that we cannot explain and may never be able to. Some of these are objects or structures that were made by other civilizations. We can see these things and these places, but we still do not fully understand how or why they were created. We might call them mysteries of the past. Easter Island: °@°@When European explorers first arrived on this remote Pacific island on Easter Day in 1722, they discovered a coast lined with hundreds of giant, god-like statues carved from volcanic rock, each of them facing away from the sea. Their age is uncertain, but they are thought to date back to around A.D. 300. That the completion of these statues required thousands of workers is obvious. But in 1722 there were only a few hundred people living on the island, and they lived in primitive conditions. So who made these statues? It seems that a great civilization must once have inhabited Easter Island. According to legend, the tribe that built the statues was wiped out in a vicious battle with another tribe during the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century.  However, some researchers claim that these statues were probably erected by rival tribes, each wanting to have more and larger statues than the other as a sign of status and wealth. In any case, it is thought that the Easter Islanders chopped down palm trees to make rollers and sleds in order to move their statues, and that the existing civilization finally collapsed because of this overuse of natural resources. The Nasca Lines: °@°@This huge arrangement of straight lines and drawings of birds and animals was carved into the desert near the Andes Mountains in Peru beginning around 500 B.C. The total design took a thousand years to complete. The patterns are only clearly visible from the air. Covering more than five hundred square kilometers, they have been called the biggest drawings ever created. It is amazing that the ancient Nascan people could have had such highly developed surveying skills. It is possible, scientists believe, that they invented the earliest hot air balloons, which they could have used to survey the land and plan the drawings. Why they created them is another mystery. Drawings on pottery pieces dug up by archaeologists, and the ancient technique of weaving developed by the Nascan people, have given researchers insight into what the purpose of the lines might have been. Like other ancient designs and structures, they may have had some religious or ritualistic function, perhaps as a way of communicating with the gods. Machu Picchu: °@°@High up in the Andes Mountains, Macchu Picchu has been called a °ßlost city°® ever since it was rediscovered by American explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911. In fact, it was a recreational and religious site rather than a city, being the former summer palace of an Inca king. Its majesty, and its mystery, lie in its spectacular location. Machu Picchu was a carefully laid-out area of houses and temples, all supported by a network of underground walls. It was completed around 1450, and is thought to have housed around 750 people. Since the city stood near the top of a mountain at a height of almost three thousand meters, it is almost impossible to imagine how the Incas managed to transport the large stones used to build it. What°¶s more, though some of the building blocks weighed over fifty tons, they were cut and joined together with incredible precision, and without mortar. The ruins of Macchu Picchu are one of the world°¶s most beautiful and enigmatic archeological sites. Teotihuacan: °@°@About fifty kilometers north of Mexico City lies the valley °ßwhere men become gods.°® That is the meaning of the Aztec name Teotihuacan, believed to have been the sixth largest city in the world at its peak in A.D. 600. Though the Aztecs named Teotihuacan, they did not live there, but instead considered it the place where the world was created. In fact, it is not known who built Teotihuacan, or why it went into decline and was abandoned by A.D. 750. In its heyday, the city had a population of around 200,000. It was beautifully built and much more impressive than any European city of the time. Its centerpiece was an enormous, 2.5-kilometer-long boulevard known to the Aztecs as the Avenue of the Dead. On either side of it stand huge platforms, and two pyramids large enough to rival those of ancient Egypt. The culture and history of those who built them remain a mystery. °@°@These are just a few of the mysterious creations of ancient humans. Others exist all over the world. Taken together, these mysteries point to other questions. For one thing, how were people inspired to create such structures? That is, where did this impulse come from? Here is another question to ponder: will the statues and buildings we erect today also become a mystery to future humans? 
Unit 1  See for Yourself. 	Eric Chen, a twenty-year-old college student from Taiwan, has joined the Work and Travel USA program and has been working in Florida as a waiter in a buffet restaurant for three weeks. His duties include refilling trays and cleaning tables for customers. Boring as the job might seem, Eric has gained some special experiences from it. For example, a local customer wearing a Chinese tunic suit often practiced Mandarin with him, and an elderly lady once comforted him when he accidentally spilled salad dressing all over her clothes. What°¶s more, every day before the buffet restaurant opens for customers, Eric sits down and eats with his co-workers the meal prepared specifically for them by the chef. This helps Eric save money, so that he can afford to appreciate some of the area°¶s famous tourist attractions on weekends. 	Pamela Tsai, on the other hand, just graduated from college this year and is visiting Australia on the Australia Working Holiday Visa. Currently, she is working in a peach orchard near Melbourne. Before this, she worked at three other jobs: One was lobster packaging, another was grape pruning, and the other was ski repairing. Pamela likes Australia°¶s relaxed atmosphere, but the job she is doing now is not easy. From 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., under the blazing sun, she needs to reach up and bend down to pick the fruits, and put them into buckets. Pamela, like many of the other working holiday travelers there, lives in an on-site caravan park, which provides backpackers with basic accommodations. After this job, she will join the Great Ocean Road tour and then fly to the Gold Coast to enjoy the beaches and sunshine there. 	It goes without saying that before Eric and Pamela set off on their journeys, they did a lot of research to find out the specific details of these programs. The Work and Travel USA program is open to students ranging in age from 18 to 28. After employers in cooperation with the program examine applicants°¶ personal information and r?sum?s, every applicant selected will have an interview with the program manager. Although students are required to possess a certain level of proficiency in English in order to live and work in the United States, what matters most is their passion and willingness to share and communicate. This is what Eric discovered before he decided to participate in the Work and Travel USA program. 	As for Pamela, a 21-year-old woman who is fond of beautiful landscapes and natural environments, Australia was her first choice. As a result, she googled °ßworking holiday in Australia°® to know more about the life and jobs there. She learned that people who are older than 18 and younger than 30 are eligible to apply for the Australia Working Holiday Visa. She also found out that if she got a job there, she could earn some money to supplement her funds while she was traveling abroad during the 12 months on this visa. 	Programs like the Work and Travel USA and the Working Holiday encourage young people to explore our planet. In addition to making money and gaining valuable work experience, those who take part in these programs can develop global perspectives, get a real taste of foreign cultures, and enhance their ability to solve problems. However, without a full understanding of these programs and a positive attitude, no one is guaranteed a memorable, worthwhile trip. Whoever is interested in these programs should be prepared for hard work, unexpected situations, and even problems like racial discrimination. When you are physically and mentally ready, go and see for yourself how amazing the world is. °XBy Amy Rashap 
Unit 10  Words Can Hurt. 	It is a widely acknowledged truth that words have power. When people say mean or rude things to us, their words may end up hurting our feelings. It should come as no surprise, then, that most of us have encountered verbal abuse. Seen from this point of view, verbal abuse is actually quite common. What many of us may never have anticipated, nonetheless, is how greatly verbal abuse can affect us. In fact, scientific research has demonstrated that verbal abuse is not only emotionally damaging, but also physically harmful. 	Verbal abuse occurs when someone says something impolite or offensive, especially when that person is angry, and it can take many forms. Sometimes it is an active assault, as when a boss tells an employee off by saying that he or she is an °ßidiot°® for failing to meet a deadline, or when a student is mocked, taunted, or harassed by his or her classmates for being different. The family is probably the last place that most people expect verbal abuse to happen in, but it happens there as well when a parent insults or scolds a child regularly. Verbal abuse can also be passive, and this type of abuse takes place when a parent ignores a child or frequently discounts the child°¶s opinions. 	For those who have been exposed to verbal abuse, it is highly likely that they will have low self-esteem and may be plagued by emotional problems, such as anxiety or depression. At times, the scars are so deep that some victims begin to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Left depressed and without hope, these people run an increased risk of committing suicide. Additionally, victims of verbal abuse often wind up inflicting this pain on other people. They do so mainly because this is the only means of expression that they know. In other cases, the cycle of abuse continues because a victim may unconsciously want to regain power, and becoming an abuser is one way to do this. 	Recent studies have also uncovered the long-term physical damage that verbal abuse can cause. One study focused on the brains of the verbally abused. Examining the brain scans of these victims, researchers discovered that these victims°¶ brains looked much like those of disabled people. In some cases, the trauma of verbal abuse even caused the left side of the brain to stop developing, which often leads to a permanent decline in memory. There is also evidence that verbal abuse can reduce language ability as well as diminish the senses. 	Perhaps it is time to reexamine the old saying, °ßSticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.°® While it is true that most wounds will heal eventually, the mental scars that result from verbal abuse can run very deep. Sadly, the suffering is often the last thing that people are able to recover from. Therefore, we should always bear in mind that our words can hurt and as a consequence choose our words very wisely before we utter them. After all, once hurtful things have been said, it is never easy to take them back. °XBy Theodore Pigott
°@°@In a forest, a man stood one winter night watching and listening, as though he was waiting for some beast1 of the woods to come within the range2 of his vision, and later, of his rifle2. As he stepped around the trunk3 of a huge beech3, he came face to face with the very man he sought.  °@°@ The two men stood glaring4 at each other for a long, silent moment. Each had a rifle in his hand; each had hate in his heart. The chance had come to give full play to the passions of a lifetime. But a man who has been brought up under the code of a restraining5 civilization cannot easily get up enough nerve6 to shoot down his neighbor in cold blood and without a word spoken, except for an offense against honor. And before the moment of hesitation had given way to action, nature°¶s own violence overwhelmed them both. A fierce sound of the storm7 had been answered by a splitting8 crash over their heads; and before they could run away, a mass of falling beech tree branches thundered9 down on them. °@°@ Both were alive and struggling, but obviously helplessly pinned down and seriously injured. At Ulrich von Gradwitz4°¶s side, so near that under ordinary circumstances10 he could almost have touched him, lay Georg Znaeym5, alive and struggling, but obviously as helplessly pinned down as himself. °@°@°ßSo you°¶re not killed, as you ought11 to be,°® he cried.  °ßHa, caught in the stolen forest, real justice for you!°®  °@°@°ßI°¶m caught in my own forest land,°® Ulrich responded.  °ßWhen my men come to release us, you shall die. Shame on you, caught invading a neighbor°¶s land!°®  °@°@°ßI have men, too, close behind me; and they will be here first and do the releasing. Then, it will be easy for them to roll this mass of trunk right over on the top of you.°®  °@°@°ßMy men had orders to follow in ten minutes°¶ time. When they get me out¢wI will remember your hint.°®  °@°@Both men spoke with the bitterness of possible loss before them, each knowing that it might be a long time before his men would seek him out or find him. °@°@After a while, both had given up the useless struggle to free themselves from the mass of wood; Ulrich managed to use his one free hand to draw out his wine bottle from his coat pocket. Even so, it was long before he could open the stopper6 or get any of the liquid down his throat. The wine was warming and reviving, and he took pity on his enemy. °@°@°ßCould you reach this bottle if I threw it over to you?°® Ulrich asked suddenly. °ßThere is good wine in it. Let us drink, even if tonight one of us dies.°®  °@°@°ßNo, I can scarcely see anything, so much blood around my eyes,°® Georg said. °ßBesides, I don°¶t drink wine with an enemy.°®  °@°@Ulrich was silent for a few minutes. An idea was slowly forming and growing in his brain. In the pain and faint12 that Ulrich himself was feeling, the old fierce hatred13 seemed to be dying down. °@°@°ßNeighbor,°® he said presently14, °ßdo as you please if your men come first. But I°¶ve changed my mind. If my men are the first to come, you shall be the first to be helped, as though you were my guest. We have quarreled15 all our lives over this stupid area of forest where the trees can°¶t even stand upright16 in a breath of wind. Lying here tonight, I°¶ve come to think that, if you°¶ll help me bury17 the old quarrel, I°¶ll ask you to be my friend.°®  °@°@Georg was silent for so long that Ulrich thought, perhaps, he had fainted with the pain of his injuries. Then he spoke slowly, °ßNo one living can remember seeing a Znaeym and a Von Gradwitz talking to each other in friendship. But if we choose to end our hatred tonight, there is none other to interfere, no interlopers from outside. I would never fire a shot on your land, except when you invited me as a guest; and you should come and shoot with me down in the marshes18 where the wild fowls19 are. I never thought to do other than hate you all my life, but I think I have changed my mind about things, too, this last half-hour. And you offered me your wine.... Ulrich von Gradwitz, I°¶ll be your friend.°® °@°@For a time both men were silent, thinking about the wonderful changes that this dramatic reconciliation7 would bring about. They lay and waited for help. And each prayed that his men might be the first to arrive, so that he might be the first to show honorable20 attention to the enemy that had become a friend. °@°@ Presently, as the wind dropped for a moment, Ulrich broke silence. °@°@°ßLet°¶s shout for help,°® he said. °@°@°ßThey won°¶t carry far,°® Georg said, °ßbut we can try.°®  °@°@The two raised their voices in a prolonged21 hunting call. °@°@A few minutes later, °ßTogether again,°® Ulrich said. °@°@There was silence again for some minutes. Then Ulrich gave a joyful cry. °@°@°ßI can see figures coming through the wood. They are following in the way.°®  °@°@Both men raised their voices in as loud a shout as they could muster8. °@°@°ßThey hear us! They°¶ve stopped. Now they see us. They°¶re running down the hill toward us,°® Ulrich cried. °@°@°ßHow many of them are there?°® Georg asked. °@°@°ßI can°¶t see distinctly,°® Ulrich said, °ßnine or ten.°®  °@°@°ßThen they are yours,°® Georg said. °ßI had only seven out with me.°®  °@°@°ßThey are making all the speed they can,°® Ulrich said gladly. °@°@°ßAre they your men?°® Georg asked. °ßAre they your men?°® he repeated impatiently as Ulrich did not answer. °@°@°ßNo,°® Ulrich said with an idiotic22 laugh and hideous23 fear. °@°@°ßWho are they?°® Georg asked quickly, straining24 his eyes to see what the other would gladly not have seen. °@°@°ßWolves!°®
