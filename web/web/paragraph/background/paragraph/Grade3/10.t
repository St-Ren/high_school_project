Mysteries of the Past.      Human beings have made many discoveries and have accomplished many things. We have explored the surface of the moon. We have learned to split atoms1. We have figured out how to create computers. With the vast2 knowledge of modern science, it seems there is nothing, or very little, that we do not know or will not know eventually. Nevertheless, there are still things in the world that we cannot explain. Some of these are objects that we can see clearly¡Xin fact, some of them are huge¡Xand are standing right before us. They are objects that were even made by human beings¡Xand yet, we cannot fully understand how or why they were created. They are the mysteries of the past.            The Pyramids1: The great pyramids of Egypt, which reached their highest development around 2500 B.C., are perhaps the most famous of the world¡¦s ancient mysteries. It is estimated that the largest of the pyramids took twenty years to build and involved3 the labor of a hundred thousand workers moving 2.6 million blocks of stone into place. How these massive4 blocks of stone were lifted and moved without the use of modern technology is a question that has never been fully answered, although many theories have been suggested. They may have been placed on wooden rollers5 or on brick ramps6. Even more amazing, though, is that such an ancient  society would have had the technical ability to design these magnificent structures, which include many inner rooms and tunnels2, and that they would have been able to organize so many workers to complete such a task.       Stonehenge3: This unusual circular7 arrangement of stone columns8 in southern Britain dates back to 3000 B.C. Although many of the original stones are no longer standing, those that are measure up to five meters in height and are topped with lintels4, or horizontally9 placed stones that create a sort of roof around the circle. Most scholars today believe that Stonehenge was designed by ancient tribes10 as an astronomical11 calendar, used to predict lunar12 and solar eclipses5. Some also say the site may have been a temple13. No one, however, knows for sure. Moreover, it remains a mystery just how these huge stones were brought to the site and placed in such a specific14 circular arrangement. As with the pyramids, it would have taken many workers and many days¡Xor rather years¡X to accomplish. What could make it so important to these ancient people to make such an effort? And why would they have such an interest in eclipses? Because of its mysterious origins, the site has been associated with many legends, perhaps most famously with the stories of King Arthur. According to one legend, the stones were magically flown into place by Merlin, the famous wizard15 of Arthurian legend.             Easter Island: When European explorers arrived at this remote Pacific island in 1722, they discovered its coast was lined with hundreds of godlike statues16 carved from volcanic17 rock, each of them facing inland18, away from the sea. Each statue wears a crown6 and has very long ears. All of them are nearly identical19, except that some are taller than others, with the tallest being two stories in height 20 and weighing several tons. Once again, it is difficult for us to imagine how people with only primitive21 technology would have been able to move these huge rocks from the area where they were quarried7. Their meaning is also a mystery. They might appear to be guarding the island, except they are looking inward22, not outward23. Some archeologists believe they may have represented the tribe¡¦s ancestors24, but beyond this, their purpose is unknown. Their age is also uncertain, but they are estimated to date back to around A.D. 300. According to legend, the tribe that built the statues was wiped out in a vicious25 battle with another tribe sometime during the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century.       The Nasca Lines: This huge arrangement of lines and drawings was carved into the desert near the Andes8 Mountains in Peru9 beginning around 500 B.C. and took one thousand years to complete. Covering more than five hundred square10 kilometers, it has been called the biggest drawing ever created. Overlying26 the drawings of birds, animals, insects27 and flowers is a complex28  network of intersecting29 lines, some of which are hundreds of miles long and extend30 across the desert plains and up into the mountains. One of the greatest wonders about the Nasca Lines is that they show the Nascan people had highly developed surveying skills. Even the longest of the lines are perfectly straight, although they can be viewed in whole only from the air. It is possible, scientists believe, that the ancient Nascan people may have invented the earliest hot air balloons, which they could have used to survey the land and plan the drawings. Why they would have created these drawings is another mystery. Like most other ancient structures, they are believed to have had some religious or ritualistic function, perhaps meant as a means of communicating with the gods.       The above are just a few of the many mysterious creations of ancient humans. Others exist all over the world. Taken together, these mysteries point to yet another mystery: For whatever purpose, just how did human beings first get the inspiration to build and to create such structures? Just where does this impulse31 come from? Here also is another question to consider: Will the statues and buildings we erect32 today also become a source of mystery for future Humans?          
Already Perfect. ¡@¡@Other people may be there to help us, teach us, guide us along our path1. But the lesson to be learned is always ours. ¡XMelody Beattie1 ¡@¡@Everyone can identify with the need to fit in. Each one of us struggles with self-esteem2 and self-worth3 to some degree. I spent much of my time striving4 to achieve perfection5 in every aspect of my life. ¡@¡@What I did not realize was that in my desperate need to be perfect, I sacrificed6 the very body and mind that allowed me to live. ¡@¡@I was a happy kid with lots of friends and a supportive family. But growing up was really hard and even scary sometimes. ¡@¡@During my childhood, I was constantly involved in something that included an audience viewing my achievements or my failures. I was into acting by age seven, and progressed7 to training for and competing in gymnastics2, horseback riding and dance¡Xall of which required major commitment8, discipline and strength. My personality thrived9 on the high energy required to keep up. I wanted everyone¡¦s praise and acceptance10, but I was my own toughest critic. ¡@¡@After I graduated from high school and moved out on my own, my struggles with self-esteem and happiness increased. I began to put pressure on myself to succeed in the adult world. Meanwhile11, I was feeling very inadequate12 and unsuccessful. I started to believe that my difficulties and what I perceived13 to be my ¡§failures¡¨ in life were caused by my weight. I had always been a thin-to-average sized person. Suddenly, I was convinced that I was overweight14. In my mind, I was FAT! ¡@¡@Slowly, my inability15 to be ¡§thin¡¨ began to torture16 me. I found myself involved in competition again. But this time, I was competing against myself. I began to control17 my food by trying to diet18, but nothing seemed to work. My mind became obsessed19 with beating my body at this game. I slowly cut back on what I ate each day. With every portion I didn¡¦t finish or meal I skipped20, I told myself that I was succeeding, and in turn, I felt good about myself. ¡@¡@Thus began a downward3 spiral4 of my becoming what is known as an anorexic5. The dictionary defines it as ¡§suppressing21 or causing loss of appetite, resulting in a state of anorexia6.¡¨ When taken to an extreme, anorexia can cause malnutrition22 and deprive23 the body of the important vitamins and minerals that it needs to be healthy. ¡@¡@In the beginning, I felt great¡Xattractive, strong, successful, almost superhuman. I could do something others couldn¡¦t: I could go without food. It made me feel special, and that I was better than everyone else. What I didn¡¦t see was that I was slowly killing myself. ¡@¡@People around me began to notice my weight loss. At first they weren¡¦t alarmed24; maybe some were even envious25. But then the comments held a tone of concern26. ¡§You¡¦re losing too much weight.¡¨ ¡§Elisa, you¡¦re so thin.¡¨ ¡§You look sick.¡¨ ¡§You¡¦ll die if you keep this up.¡¨ ¡@¡@All their words only reassured me that I was on the right path, getting closer to ¡§perfection.¡¨     Sadly, I made my physical appearance the top priority27 in my life, believing that it was the way to become successful and accepted. As an actress, I am constantly being judged by my appearance. The camera automatically28 makes people appear heavier than they are. So I was getting mixed messages like, ¡§Elisa, you are so skinny29, but you look great on camera.¡¨ ¡@¡@I cut back on my food more and more, until a typical day consisted30 of half a teaspoon7 of nonfat yogurt8 and coffee in the morning, and a cup of grapes9 at night. If I ate even a bite more than my allotted31 ¡§crumbs¡¨ for the day, I hated myself and took laxatives10 to rid32 my body of whatever I had eaten. ¡@¡@It got to the point where I no longer went out with my friends. I couldn¡¦t¡Xif I went to dinner, what would I eat? I avoided their phone calls. If they wanted to go to the movies or just hang out at home, I couldn¡¦t be there¡Xwhat if food was around? I had to be home alone to eat my little cup of grapes. Otherwise, I thought I was failing. Everything revolved33 around my strict34 schedule of eating. I was embarrassed to eat in front of anyone, believing that they would think I was gluttonous11 and ugly. ¡@¡@My poor nutrition began to cause me to lose sleep. I found it hard to concentrate on my work or to focus on anything for any length of time. I was pushing myself harder and harder at the gym, struggling to burn the calories12 that I hadn¡¦t even eaten. My friends tried to help me but I denied that I had a problem. None of my clothes fit, and it was hard to buy any, since I had shrunk to smaller than a size zero! ¡@¡@Then one night, like so many nights before, I couldn¡¦t sleep, and my heart felt as though it might beat its way out of my chest35. I tried to relax, but I couldn¡¦t.  ¡@¡@The beating became so rapid and so strong that I could no longer breathe. The combination of starving myself and taking pills36 to get rid of anything that I did eat caused me to nearly have a heart attack37. I stood up, and immediately fell down. I was really scared, and I knew I needed help. My roommate rushed me to the hospital, beginning the long road to my recovery. It took doctors, nurses, nutritionists, therapists38, medications, food supplements39 ... and most important, a new sense of what was really true about myself to get back on track with reality. ¡@¡@Recovering from what I did to my body and reprogramming the way I think about myself has been a very slow and extremely painful process. I still struggle with the effects of anorexia every day. Although it has been a couple of years since that hospital visit, it is by no means over for me. I must be honest with myself and stay committed to being healthy. ¡@¡@I had used my anorexia as a means of expression and control. I used it as my gauge13 for self-esteem and self-worth. It was my identity. Now I realize that the way to success lies in my heart, mind and soul, rather than in my physical appearance. ¡@¡@I now use my intelligence, my talents and acts of kindness to express myself. This is true beauty, and it has nothing to do with the size of my body. With my experience of trying to be ¡§perfect¡¨ on the outside, I had sacrificed who I was on the inside. What I know now is, we are¡Xeach and every one of us¡Xalready perfect. ¡Xby Elisa Donovan, from Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II. 
Much More Than Just a Telephone. ¡@¡@The arrival of the telephone in the late nineteenth century changed long-distance communication forever. Its successor1, the cellphone, has had an even greater impact on the world in the last two decades. It is now as much a part of modern life as the TV and the car, and we can barely2 imagine life without it. Its advantages are obvious3. By providing instant contact from almost any place at any time, cellphones have greatly increased day-to-day convenience. More importantly, they help save lives, making emergency services more accessible and often playing a key role in search-and-rescue operations. They can be traced geographically using navigation1 tools and GPS2, and many missing people have been found due to their cellphones. ¡@¡@If you have been using cellphones for a few years, you will appreciate how far they¡¦ve come in a short time. You can already take and send pictures and videos with one, as well as send text messages3, download ringtones4, and even do some Web surfing. At the same time, they have gotten smaller, slimmer, and lighter. Apple¡¦s iPhone5, now into its fourth generation, has been a pioneer4 among ¡§smartphones6¡¨ and now has over 350,000 applications, or ¡§apps,¡¨ available for download. Taiwan¡¦s HTC corporation7 has produced smartphones based on the Windows operating system, as well as for Google¡¦s Android8. The level of sophistication5 and functions of these handheld devices are now close to those of a PC. And the cellphones of tomorrow are set to be capable of even more, as well as looking like nothing you¡¦ve seen before. ¡@¡@Before long, you may be able to buy a communications device that is as thin as a sheet of paper and can be worn on the wrist. In fact, there is already a flexible6 touch-screen display9 called ClearPad10. It can be wrapped around a cellphone like paper, and unwrapped to view images on a larger screen. The biggest drawback7 to looking at images on a cellphone has always been the tiny screen. But the time is coming when cellphones will work as projectors11. A company called MicroVision12 is developing one such device. You will be able to point your phone at a white wall and watch a movie almost as if you were at a theater. ¡@¡@Other potential developments include cellphones that can be used for remote control. Imagine being able to turn on the air conditioning while you are on your way home, so that you can arrive at a house that is already cool and comfortable. And wouldn¡¦t it be great to have a video chat13 function, a cellphone that can be used as a credit card or that can store files and documents like a computer, or even an always-connected video game console14? The possibilities seem unlimited. Pretty soon, it will be inaccurate8 to call them phones at all. They will be multipurpose15 devices that just happen to make phone calls. We will be carrying our world around with us. 
ï»¿ããDo you ever feel unhappy when somebody gives you a compliment? It does happen sometimes, especially when you know the speaker doesnât mean what he or she says. Chances are people may say one thing but mean another. In real life, we may rely on facial expressions, body language, or the circumstances to decipher what the speaker really intends to say. However, when reading poems, we may need to read every word closely to determine the tone of the speaker.  ããOften when we first encounter a poem, we start by inquiring, âWhat is it all about?â We want to know what the subject of the poem is, be it love or death. But to fully comprehend a poem, we need to explore the speakerâs attitude toward the subject, which is made clear from the âtoneâ of the speakerâs voice. Since the speaker does not really talk to us in person, the tone of his or her voice is manifested through many subtle arrangements, such as certain choices of words or unusual punctuation.       One way to help you clarify the tone is to listen to the voice as if someone were talking to you. We may try to know more about this person and visualize his or her existence by asking the following questions:   Who is the speaker in the poem? A petulant teenager or a miserable housewife?   How does the speakerâs voice sound? Happy or sad? Enthusiastic or cold?   Does the poem suggest an attitude or emotion? If so, what is it?   What adjective would best describe the tone of the voice? Regretful or optimistic? Indifferent or emotional?  ããTo some extent, the tone of the speaker is the soul of a poem, and only when it is properly grasped can we claim to have a thorough understanding of the poem. Now we are going to read two poems, both concerning the loss of someone important. Read them closely, and see how each reveals the speakerâs feelings about, or attitude toward, this significant event.  One Art The art of losing isnât hard to master; so many things seem filled with the intent to be lost that their loss is no disaster. Lose something every day. Accept the fluster  of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.  The art of losing isnât hard to master.  Then practice losing farther, losing faster:  places, and names, and where it was you meant  to travel. None of these will bring disaster.  I lost my motherâs watch. And look! my last, or  next-to-last, of three loved houses went.  The art of losing isnât hard to master.  I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,  some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.  I miss them, but it wasnât a disaster. âEven losing you (the joking voice, a gesture  I love) I shanât have lied. Itâs evident  the art of losingâs not too hard to master  though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster. âElizabeth Bishop*(-)â  Go Gentle You have grown wings of pain  and flap around the bed like a wounded gull  calling for water, calling for tea, for grapes  whose skins you cannot penetrate Remember when you taught me  how to swim? Let go, you said,  the lake will hold you up.  I long to say, Father let go  and death will hold you up.  Outside the fall goes on without us.  How easily the leaves give in,  I hear them on the last breath of wind,  passing this disappearing place.  âLinda Pastan* (--)â  
ï»¿ããCharlie Brown is one of the main characters, along with Snoopy* and others, in the extremely popular American comic strip Peanuts*, the longest-running comic strip in the world with a readership of 3 million worldwide. ããCharlie is an unusual choice for a hero. He is a plain-looking schoolboy with a round face. A straight and upright kid, he displays few features of the typical heroes like Superman*, Spider-Man* or Batman*. Rather, his name has become a synonym for the eternal loser: we say âHe is a real Charlie Brown.â ããHe loses countless baseball games and often gets tricked by Lucy van Pelt* when he is trying to kick a football. He never plays a game of checkers* without getting beaten, and he never manages to successfully fly a kite. Whatâs worse, he never gets valentines* or Christmas cards; he only gets rocks when he goes trick-or-treating on Halloween. He is prone to depression and anxiety, constantly wonders if he is liked or respected, and always hopes for peopleâs approval and acceptance. But he is a lovable child with a good heart and endless determination and hope. His stories strike a sympathetic chord with millions of people. ããThere are naturally many similarities between Charlie Brown and Charles M. Schulz*, the cartoonist who created Peanuts. As a matter of fact, Charles Schulz once indicated that Peanuts is autobiographical. Like Charlie Brownâs parents, Schulzâs father was a barber and his mother a housewife. Like Charlie Brown, he was timid and withdrawn, and he kept a dog as a pet. Like Charlie Brown, he played for his neighborhood baseball team, and like Charlie Brown, the worried young Schulz couldnât sleep on the night before a game. Failure and rejection were the two themes that dominated Schulzâs childhood and early adulthood. There is even a similarity in their names â Charlie is a nickname for Charles. ããThe popular saying âThe harder you fall, the higher you bounce backâ is definitely true of Schulz. He made up his mind to become a cartoonist when he was seven, but his initial works kept getting rejected. Years later, he said he could still remember vividly âthe sinking feelingâ when he received rejection notes in the mail. In World War II, Schulz was drafted into the military. After the war, he lost at least three girlfriends because they had fallen in love with other men. In 1, he traveled to Chicago to show his works to some prospective publishers, only to be rejected by all of them. His response was to go back home and keep drawing, and he constantly refined his illustrations. He took the rejections as constructive criticism and an opportunity to improve  himself. Even when his own mother didnât believe in his dreams, he didnât give up. Schulz said later, âI was never discouraged. I always knew I was getting closer and closer.â His perseverance eventually led to the creation of Peanuts, which soon became one of the most influential and well-received comic strips of all time. He never blamed anyone for his failures along the way. In fact, he gave credit to his failures for making him more determined to finally achieve success. ããThis is the spirit that the author attempts to convey in his comic strips. Charlie Brown never blames or takes revenge on those who defeat him or let him down. He keeps trying to fly a kite and keeps going to the baseball mound over and over again, hoping to pitch a winning game. He firmly believes that he will make it big someday, however difficult or unlikely that may be. âDeterminedâ is a better word to describe him than âstubborn.â Life is full of frustrations and setbacks for him, and perhaps for most people. But it is a kind heart and endless persistence that keep the world moving and define a true hero. That hero could be Charlie Brown, or any one of us.
ï»¿ããYou may have heard of or been to rotating observatories* situated at the topmost level of high-rise buildings where you can enjoy a 3-degree panoramic* view. But have you ever imagined a building with rotating floors from top to bottom? Living on any level of the building, you could indulge in breakfast while enjoying the astonishing mountain view and have dinner while admiring the vast ocean. You would no longer have to wake up each day to the exact same view outside your apartment window. ããThis fantasy may be transformed into reality by the proposed Dynamic Tower, the worldâs first âbuilding in motion.â A brainchild of the Italian architect David Fisher*, this rotating tower will be built in Dubai*, a city-state* of the United Arab Emirates* that boasts many ambitious projects. As is expected, Fisherâs progressive design concept will attract attention from all over the world. It is, after all, a totally new and original idea. ããMagnificent buildings around the world have made everlasting impressions on people with their strikingly original shapes and styles. However, now even the traditional concept of the âstatic*â building is being dramatically challenged. The Dynamic Tower is unique in that it is, in Fisherâs words, âdesigned by life, shaped by time.â That is to say, unlike any buildings we have ever known, it will continually change its shape as time passes. Seen from the exterior, the building will transform into a series of artistic forms as it rotates. At some moments it may resemble a twisted strand of DNA*; at other times it may look like a ballerina* doing a pirouette* in slow motion. The possibilities are endless. ããSince each floor of the building will act as an individual component and thus be capable of rotating independently, your upstairs and downstairs neighbors may see different views from the one you see. While most floors will revolve at a pace controlled by a central computer system, people who can afford villas on the top floors will have the extra luxury of rotating their apartments at will with a voice-activated* control device. Moreover, a drive-in* elevator will take all the residents and their cars to their own floors so they can park right outside their high-rise apartments. ããOn top of its novel design, this futuristic edifice* will also be innovative in the way it is built and powered. It will be the worldâs first completely prefabricated* high-rise building. The floors will hang like rings around an immobile cement core. Except for the central core that will be built on site, all the floors will be prefabricated in a factory and then shipped to the site to be attached to the core. The construction process will start from the top floor and each level will be connected to the core until the ground floor is completed. Time-consuming and labor-intensive as this process may seem, a mere 8 workers will be able to finish one story in just a week, which is many times faster than the time required for a conventional building. Whatâs more, the revolution of each floor will be powered by electricity generated by solar panels and gigantic wind turbines* positioned between each floor. The building will thus be entirely self-sufficient, and might even generate excess energy that can be sold to neighboring facilities. Therefore, in addition to its revolutionary design, the Dynamic Tower will also be a âgreenâ building. ããRecognized by TIME magazine as one of the âBest Inventions of the Yearâ in 2, the Dynamic Tower, according to Fisher, âwill radically change not only the concept of design but also that of construction and real estate*, bringing a new dimension to architecture and to our way of living.â If the project in Dubai goes smoothly, there will be more revolving towers to come in metropolitan areas around the world.  
ï»¿ããWhat is the secret of happiness? The answer may vary from person to person. Santiago*, an Andalusian* shepherd boy in The Alchemist*, finds himself searching for a treasure in the Egyptian pyramids in his dream. He is hesitant about giving up all he has to go on a quest for the treasure he dreams about. The King of Salem* comes up to him and tells him the following story, reminding him that the secret of happiness is to listen to his heart but not to overlook what he already has. ããA merchant sent his son to learn the secret of happiness from the wisest of men. The young man wandered through the desert for forty days until he reached a beautiful castle at the top of a mountain. There lived the sage for whom the young man was looking.  ããAfter the young man entered the castle, he witnessed a great number of activitiesâmerchants coming and going, people chatting in the corners, a small orchestra playing sweet melodies, and a table laden* with the most delectable* dishes. Then suddenly the young man saw the white-bearded wise man walking about slowly and talking to each visitor, one at a time. The old sage looked wonderfully peaceful and relaxed. ããThe young man did not rush to meet him, but rather waited beside a window for nearly two hours. When it was finally his turn for consultation, he explained the reason for his visit while the sage listened attentively with great patience. But when the young man finished, the sage said he did not have the time to explain to him the secret of happiness at that moment. He suggested that the young man take a stroll around his palace and come back in two hours. ããâHowever, I want to ask a favor of you,â he added, handing the boy a teaspoon into which he had poured two drops of oil. âWhile you walk, carry this spoon and donât let the oil spill out.â  ããThe young man began to climb up and down the palace staircases, always keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon lest the oil should spill out. At the end of the two hours he returned to the wise man. ããâSo,â asked the sage, âdid you see the Persian tapestries* hanging in my dining room? Did you see the marvelous garden, which took my master gardeners ten years to create? Did you notice the beautiful parchments* in my library?â ããEmbarrassed, the young man confessed that he had seen nothing. His only concern had been not to spill the two drops of oil that the wise man had entrusted to him. ããâSo, go back and see the wonders of my world,â said the sage. âYou canât trust a man if you donât know his house.â ããNow more at ease, the young man took the spoon and strolled again through the palace, this time paying attention to all the works of art that hung from the ceiling and upon the walls. He saw the majestic mountains all around the palace, the delicacy of the flowers in the gardens, and the exquisite taste with which each work of art had been placed in its niche*. Returning to the sage, he reported in detail all that he had seen. ããâBut where are the two drops of oil that I entrusted to you?â asked the wise man. Looking down at the spoon, the young man realized that he had spilled the oil. âWell, this is the only advice I have to give you,â said the sage of sages. âThe secret of happiness is to see all the wonders of the world and never forget the two drops of oil in the spoon.â 
ï»¿ããOne evening in London, the famous lawyer Mr. Utterson* learned that a violent and malicious* man named Edward Hyde* had recently used a check that had been made out by Uttersonâs friend and clientï¼the well-respected Dr. Henry Jekyll*. The news, combined with the fact that Jekyllâs will had appointed Hyde as the beneficiary, raised Uttersonâs curiosity about Jekyllâs relationship with a man of such questionable morals. ããA year later, London was rocked by the news of the vicious murder of an elderly politician named Sir Danvers Carew*. A witness reported that the politician had been brutally beaten to death with a heavy cane by Mr. Hyde. When the police showed Utterson the murder weapon, Utterson was alarmed to find that it was the exact same cane that he had given to Jekyll as a gift. ããConcerned for his friendâs reputation and safety, Utterson went to see Dr. Jekyll. Jekyll reassured him that there was nothing to worry about by showing him a letter written by Hyde. In it, the savage man apologized for his actions and promised Jekyll that he would not be heard from again. Just when Utterson breathed a sigh of relief, however, his assistant pointed out that the handwriting was almost identical to Dr. Jekyllâs. The idea that Jekyll might be assisting Hyde left Utterson shocked. ããHoping to solve the mystery, Utterson paid a visit to their mutual friend Dr. Lanyon*. Lanyon, sick and distressed, didnât say anything about Jekyll. Within two weeks he died of deteriorating health; he left behind a letter for Utterson with instructions telling him not to open it until the death or disappearance of Jekyll. ããMonths later, a servant of Dr. Jekyllâs approached Utterson. He said his master had isolated himself in his laboratory for weeks and that the voice now coming from behind the locked door sounded nothing like Dr. Jekyllâs. He asked, in desperation, for the lawyer to return with him to Jekyllâs house. With Utterson by his side, the servant broke into the doctorâs laboratory. But Jekyll was nowhere to be found. Instead, the two men discovered the body of Edward Hyde on the floor, apparently a victim of suicide. They also found a letter from Jekyll addressed to Utterson and a note urging him to first read Dr. Lanyonâs letter.  ããUtterson hurried to his office to get the letter. Lanyon wrote that he had once received a visit from a man called Edward Hyde. The strange man, he wrote, then drank an unusual potion and changed into Henry Jekyll before his very eyes. At that point, Utterson realized that Jekyll and Hyde were actually the same person and immediately opened Jekyllâs letter. ããDr. Jekyll explained that he had always hidden the darker side of his character from the outside world. Through his studies, he had found a way to separate the evil in himself from the rest of his personality. By taking a special potion he could become a completely different man, namely, Edward Hyde. And disguised in this manner, he was able to be free from the constraints of conscience, free to do whatever he pleased. As time went on, however, he realized that he was losing control over these transformations and was sometimes turning into Hyde even without taking the potion. ããDr. Jekyll wrote that he knew he would soon become Mr. Hyde permanently and would never be able to change back again. Upon this revelation, he knew that Hyde would face execution for his crimes or choose to commit suicide for fear of being apprehended. Either way, Jekyll wrote, the world would never again see his face. 
I Have a Dream. ¡@¡@I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. ¡@¡@Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon3 light of hope to millions of Negro slaves. ¡@¡@But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. And so we¡¦ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. ¡@¡@In a sense we have come to our nation¡¦s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the ¡§inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.¡¨ Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check which has come back marked ¡§insufficient funds.¡¨ ¡@¡@But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice. ¡@¡@Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God¡¦s children. ¡@¡@I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. ¡@¡@I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ¡§We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.¡¨ ¡@¡@I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. ¡@¡@I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. ¡@¡@I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. ¡@¡@I have a dream today. ¡@¡@I have a dream that one day down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. ¡@¡@I have a dream today. ¡@¡@I have a dream that one day ¡§every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low; the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.¡¨ ¡@¡@This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. ¡@¡@This will be the day when all of God¡¦s children will be able to sing with a new meaning:  ¡@¡@My country, ¡¦tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing.  ¡@¡@Land where my fathers died, Land of the pilgrims¡¦ pride, From every mountainside Let freedom ring! And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. ¡@¡@When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God¡¦s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last! 
ï»¿ ããBottled mineral2 water has become the lifestyle accessory3 of the  health-conscious and just the plain thirsty4. No longer a luxury item, the beverage has become a common sight worldwide. But according to campaigners5, the planetâs health and peopleâs health may be suffering as a result.  ããTo begin with, the basic assumption that bottled water is safer for humans, is being questioned. There is mounting6 evidence against bottled water. The Natural Resources Defense Council of America1, which carried out a four-year review of the bottled water industry, concluded âthere is no assurance that just because water comes out of a bottle, it is any cleaner or safer than water from the tap7.â Another New York City-based action group added that an estimated 25 percent of bottled water is âreally just tap water in a bottleâsometimes further treated, sometimes not.â    ããIn Britain2, Nick Reeves3, the executive director4 of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management5, said the perception that bottled water is purer than tap water is unfounded8. âFor example,â he said, âthe high mineral content of some bottled water makes them unsuitable9 for feeding babies and young children.â Additionally, most bottled water doesnât contain added fluoride6, which can make teeth stronger. Kids are drinking more bottled water and less fluoridated7 tap water, and some say thatâs behind the recent rise in dental10 decay11 ãã Storing is another problem. Placed near a heat source12, the plastic bottles can release toxic13 chemicals into the water. But thatâs not the only potential risk; so are the other things kept nearby. Experts advise against storing water in the garage, near gas fumes14pesticides and other chemicals that could, at the very least, affect the smell and taste of the H2O. At worst, they could penetrate15he bottle and contaminate16he water. Water from a tap doesnât carry these risks.  ãAnd then there is the effect of millions of plastic bottles on the planet. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)8, some 2.7 million tons (2.4 million metric9 tons) of plastic are used to bottle water each year worldwide. The plastic most commonly used is derived17 from crude18 oil. It can take between 400 and 1,000 years to degrade. ããIn terms of energy use, plastic bottles are also very costly. One report estimated that if water and soft drink bottlers had used 10 percent recycled19materials in their plastic bottles in 2004, they would have saved the equivalent20 of 72 million gallons10 of gasoline21. If they had used 25 percent, they would have saved enough energy to provide electricity to more than 680,000 homes for a year. In fact, bottled water can be 10,000 times more expensive, said Emily Arnold11, a researcher with a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group, Earth Policy Institute (EPI)12. âBottled water costs more than gasoline,â she said. Most of this extra cost is driven by transportation22and packaging23 ããSo, if you are worried about the toll13 of your bottled water habit on yourself or the Earth, you can take the following steps.  ããDrink from your tap. Unless your government warns against this, it should be fine. ããGet a canteen14. Carry your tap water in a reusable24 stainless25 steel, or a lined, drinking container, and clean it between uses. ããKeep it cool. Donât drink from a bottle that has been subjected to high temperatures26 (sitting in your car, for example), donât store it anywhere it will be exposed27 to heat or chemicals, and donât reuse24 plastic bottles. ããGo with glass. Choose glass containers over plastic whenever possible. When youâre done, recycle19 
Unit 5  Dying to Look Good. 	It¡¦s only human nature to pursue physical attractiveness. However, some people may go to extremes in order to get the looks they want. You might be stunned by how far they would go¡Xsome may even sacrifice their health. For example, those who desire to be thin sometimes deprive themselves of food to keep their weight down. A few have stomach surgery to restrict the amount of food that they can consume. It seems that being skinny is their first priority; malnutrition and unpredictable, fatal side effects count for nothing. 	In addition to weight, height may be another common worry to many people. One typical response is to wear shoes with heels, but this isn¡¦t good enough for some people who desperately want to be taller. They will undergo surgery to have their legs lengthened, which is especially remarkable because the whole process is acutely painful and can require spending up to a year in a wheelchair. The operation itself involves breaking the legs, drilling holes in them, inserting metal rods in each leg, and, finally, allowing new bones to grow in these gaps. In spite of the fact that most patients have to take painkillers to ease the pain and that there is no guarantee that the surgery will succeed, hundreds of people have this kind of surgery done every year. Unfortunately, many of them endanger their health as well as their future only to become crippled. 	People in the contemporary world are concerned about their appearance indeed. Nonetheless, it is not just in modern times that people have become obsessed by looking attractive and have risked their health as a result. In ancient Europe, dark skin was widely perceived as unattractive. Thus, many ancient Greeks and Romans applied certain make-up to make their faces look pale. Nevertheless, it never occurred to them that the make-up they applied contained lead, which consequently caused them a variety of health problems like sores and infertility. Today, though people are aware of this unpleasant fact, many still use similar make-up to whiten their skin. 	In contrast to ancient times, pale skin is not that appealing to some people nowadays. Tanned skin is getting popular, and those who want darker skin often go to tanning salons or take tanning pills to keep up with this fashion. However, both of these methods can bring about hazardous consequences. First, artificial tans are achieved with the use of tanning beds, which has been linked to skin cancer. According to recent scientific research, using a tanning bed more than once a month increases the risk of contracting skin cancer by 55 percent. Second, tanning pills contain certain kinds of additives that are actually dangerous, even for short-term use. Not only do these pills cause an itchy rash to develop all over the skin, but they may also lead to an eye disease. What¡¦s worse, tanning pills can damage one¡¦s liver. It seems that whichever way people choose, getting artificially tanned will end up costing them dear. 	It¡¦s reasonable for us to try various ways to enhance our appearance, as looking good might increase our confidence and make us happy. Yet we must keep in mind that, excluding the often perilous methods for becoming more attractive, there are still multiple other ones that we can take advantage of, such as getting a proper amount of exercise and keeping a balanced diet. After all, it is no use being physically attractive if we are not healthy to enjoy it. ¡XBy Paul Geraghty
