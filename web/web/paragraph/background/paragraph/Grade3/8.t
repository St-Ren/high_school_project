Battling the Pirates.      In April 2009, four young Swedish1 men were each sentenced1 to a year in jail and were fined2 the equivalent3 of more than NT$120 million. Their crime was piracy4. They had not robbed ships on the high seas, however. Instead, they owned an Internet company called The Pirate Bay2. Set up in 2003, it has been described as the world°¶s most high-profile5 file-sharing website. Basically, it is a forum3 where people post6 links to music, movies, and computer games so that others can download7 them for free, without having to pay the copyright8 holders. This is where the owners of The Pirate Bay fell foul of the law.      Copyright is a form of protection given to the creators of original works, including works of art, literature, drama, music, and other types of intellectual9 property. Under the idea of copyright, the creator alone has the right to make and distribute10 copies of the work and to display11 or perform it in public. In general, it is illegal12 for anyone else to do any of these things without permission13 from the person who created the work. While countries have their own laws regarding14 copyright infringement4, there are also international agreements15 to protect intellectual property rights. These laws are not always enforced16, however. And the growth of the Internet has complicated17 the situation.      The Internet has expanded electronic18 access19 to music, films, books, and other digital20 content. This presents a huge challenge to copyright protection and enforcement, not least because of the Web°¶s lack of borders. Anyone with a home computer and Internet access can copy and distribute large numbers of digital files. In recent years, this has been made easier by the appearance of peer-to-peer file-sharing programs. The effect has been devastating for the music and film industries, as sales of CDs and DVDs have fallen drastically21. Companies that make software22 or computer games have also suffered. It is estimated that there are forty million users of illegal software in the United States alone, and many more around the world.       Illegally downloading music and movies is not the only way to break copyright laws. Perhaps you are a student who would never dream of helping yourself to copyright-protected music or films, but in doing an assignment23 for school you may have copied and pasted information you read on a relevant website. Unless you put these words in quotation24 marks and credited25 the source, you were guilty of plagiarism5. Plagiarism means pretending other people°¶s written work is your own, and it can be a form of copyright violation26. Professional writers who do it will find themselves in trouble with the law. Most acts of plagiarism, however, are committed by college students who are just being lazy. The consequences27 can be serious all the same, as offenders may find themselves failing a class or even being kicked out of school.      Intellectual property infringement is not confined28 to the Internet, of course. And it is not confined to creative works. In fact, there has been a global29 trade in the copying of brand-name30 goods31 such as clothing, watches, and handbags since long before the Information Age began. This type of copying is called counterfeiting6, and there are also laws to control it. Still, although everyone understands the illegal nature of counterfeit goods, many people buy and sell them without any sense that what they are doing is wrong.      Copyright infringement, plagiarism, and counterfeiting are things that all of us should be aware of. After all, if you have worked hard to create something original, wouldn°¶t you rather be rewarded for it than see other people stealing your intellectual property and using it any way they like? 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄNo one would mistake an elephant for another animal. Even a young child can recognize an elephant with its fan-like ears, curved ivory tusks*, and long flexible trunk. As the largest animal on land, elephants are popular stars in zoos, circuses, and Hollywood* movies. But behind their enormous size hides a fascinating and mysterious world.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe ancestry of elephants dates back 3 million years, and it was likely that they lived an aquatic life. According to a recent fossil study, ancient elephants might have used their trunks to breathe while swimming. In fact, modern elephants still use their trunks as a snorkel* when crossing a river. Among the elephant‚Äôs ancestors, the best-known are the now-extinct mammoths*, which lived from around 4. million years ago to as recently as 4, years ago. Nowadays, there are only three species of elephants left on earth ‚Äî two species in Africa (the African forest elephant and the African savannah* elephant) and one species in Asia (the Asian elephant or the Indian elephant). „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe elephant‚Äôs trunk is formed of an extremely long nose and upper lip. It can pick up objects as tiny as a pea but is also strong enough to pull an entire tree out of the ground. Elephants use their trunks not only for breathing and smelling, but also for feeding, drinking, touching, and even communicating. The trunk is to an elephant what both hands and a nose combined are to a human being.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThough apparently simple-minded, elephants are in fact very intelligent and sensitive. They have been found to use tools obtained from their natural environment. For example, they know how to use sticks to scratch themselves. They also have special ways of communicating with each other. They can even feel vibrations from miles away with their sensitive feet. And what‚Äôs more surprising is that elephants have a good memory. They even update their memory, and pass down what they have learned from generation to generation. A study indicated that African elephants reacted with fear to the scent of clothes worn by the Maasai* people, who are known to demonstrate their manly* bravery by spearing elephants. „ÄÄ„ÄÄLike humans, elephants are highly sociable. They migrate as a female-dominant family herd. The males will leave their family herd and travel alone when approaching adulthood. The herd is ruled by its oldest and the most experienced female member. When she dies, one of her elder offspring takes the ‚Äúthrone.‚Äù It is this close relationship that allows elephants to acquire the knowledge needed for survival. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe life expectancy* of elephants is similar to that of human beings. However, the mother carries her unborn baby for the duration of 2 months, which is the longest for any mammal. A newborn baby is about 1 meter high and may weigh up to 1 kilograms. Several adult females, such as the baby‚Äôs aunts or cousins, will usually pitch in to help during and after its birth. They will take care of the baby until it grows up. Distant relatives will travel long distances to visit the newborn to bestow* their best wishes. Similarly, when a family member dies, elephants will gather around, touch the body with their trunks, and make mournful sounds for days. „ÄÄ„ÄÄDespite their enormous size and strength, elephants are graceful creatures. They look as meek as sheep, but have amazing intelligence and emotional responses. Compared with the tiger or the lion, maybe the elephant better deserves the title ‚Äúthe King of Beasts.‚Äù  
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄSometimes it may seem that few surprises are left for travelers. We seem to have already seen everything everywhere. But there is still at least one place where few tourists go‚ÄîMadagascar, an outlying island of great beauty and diversity off the coast of Africa. „ÄÄ„ÄÄA French* colony since 1, Madagascar gained independence as the Malagasy Republic* in 1, and was renamed Madagascar in 1. Located in the Indian Ocean* off the southeast coast of Africa, Madagascar is the fourth biggest island in the world, and its area is slightly bigger than that of its former colonial ruler. People first arrived there about 2, years ago. They traveled by canoe from places like India, Indonesia*, Africa, and Arabia*. Chinese groups came rather late, around the end of the 1th century. But there were traces of Chinese people as early as the early 1th century. Legend has it that the Chinese explorer Zheng He* from the Ming Dynasty traveled to this land. It is even said that some Chinese Madagascan* families are descended from Zheng‚Äôs mariners! While Madagascar has great ethnic diversity, its residents today exist as one culture.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄScientists sometimes call Madagascar the eighth continent. This is because a large portion of the animal and plant life here can‚Äôt be found anywhere else. For example, the cat-like fossa* is a rare animal. There are as few as 2, fossas left even in Madagascar. This massive island is also home to nine-tenths of the world‚Äôs lemurs*, a monkey-like mammal. Some larger species can jump over nine meters from branch to branch, while smaller species are only the size of a mouse. Above Madagascar‚Äôs rain forests fly roller birds*. They have green heads and white chins. Their bodies are green and blue, and their wings purple, like paintings that have come alive. Over 1, kinds of orchids thrive along the forest floor, and the rarest of all has beautiful white petals. The forests are also home to Madagascar hissing cockroaches*. These special bugs are named for the distinctive sound they make. It is thought that no other roaches in the world are capable of making a sound like this. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAside from the natural outlook, tombs for the burial of the dead can also be seen all over the island. The deceased are sometimes described as ‚Äúgods on earth‚Äù and are commonly perceived as the mediums between a supreme God and humankind. They are thought to be able to influence the fate of their living descendants. People treasure their close ties with the deceased, and the privileged position of the dead is evident in the beautiful tombs. These are built with great care and expense, and are often much sturdier and more costly than houses built for the living. The tombs around Madagascar vary in form; some are solid stone structures, while others are made of concrete with glass windows and decorations. No matter what kind of tomb they build, the builders‚Äô common purpose is to preserve their bonds with the dead.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄBecause of Madagascar‚Äôs unique sights and traditions, a traveler in search of some unconventional fun may find it fascinating. Next time you want to go to someplace exotic, try Madagascar, a land full of surprises!  
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄVenice is a city like no other. Belonging neither to the land nor to the sea, it is a city of canals and lagoons*, a place where courtyards are connected by bridges and journeys are made by water taxis or gondolas*. But the water that has brought the city so much fame has proved to be a double-edged sword, as floods often occur. No strangers to such events, Venetians* calmly shut their protective steel doors, put on their trusty boots, and continue with their daily activities. Evidently, water is very much a part of their lives. „ÄÄ„ÄÄHowever, the devastating flood on November 4, 1, made it clear that water would eventually threaten the city‚Äôs existence. On this day, a high tide swept in from the Venetian Lagoon and submerged the city for a disturbing 1 hours, leaving St. Mark‚Äôs Square* 4 feet underwater. The massive flood drew attention to a serious problem: throughout the past century, Venice had been sinking at an unprecedented* rate.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄVenice used to sink by less than one centimeter every one hundred years and was considered to be a safe place. In the last century alone, however, it fell by astonishing 2 centimeters. This has translated into far more frequent floods‚Äîroughly a hundred floods a year now, as compared to seven a year just two centuries ago. Two factors have contributed to this significant change: an accelerated rate of subsidence was responsible for about 5 percent of the 2-centimeter drop, while the rising sea level was responsible for the other 5 percent. „ÄÄ„ÄÄSubsidence had always occurred but at a very limited rate. However, since 1, this rate has increased dramatically because the water that helps to support the city began to be pumped out from the land underneath and used for industrial purposes. Although this practice has been banned, the damage cannot be undone. „ÄÄ„ÄÄPeople may not be destroying the land underneath Venice anymore, but another man-made problem now poses an even greater threat to the city‚Äôs future: rising sea levels. Since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, mankind has used huge quantities of fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide when they‚Äôre burnt. Excessive carbon dioxide leads to global warming, which in turn causes the polar ice caps* to melt and the world‚Äôs oceans to rise. Scientists say that if this process continues unchecked, Venice will not be around to see the 2nd century. „ÄÄ„ÄÄVenice‚Äôs problem is important not only because the world might lose one of its most beautiful cities, but also because it involves environmental issues that the whole world needs to face. If it were not for these very issues, the islands in the Republic of Kiribati* that have disappeared would still exist, and the people of Maldives* wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about being the next potential victims. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe crisis caused by the melting of polar ice caps and consequent rising sea levels will only become more severe. We are also damaging the natural habitats of animals, exhausting the earth‚Äôs resources, and disrupting its climate systems. In recent decades, we have been altering for the worse the way our planet functions at an incredible and unsustainable rate. This is not just something theoretical but a concrete fact. It‚Äôs high time that we reversed our destructive ways before it is too late! To save Venice and many other cities will require the collective effort of everyone‚Äîgovernments, institutions and individuals‚Äîall across the globe. Only through the determination and dedication of every one of us can this goal be achieved. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄA Harvard* professor conducted a famous psychology experiment back in 1. The subjects watched a video showing two teams of people, dressed in black and white, passing basketballs and moving around. The subjects had been instructed to count the number of passes made by the white team. During the film, a person in a full-body gorilla suit entered and walked between everyone, thumped* its chest, and walked off. The subjects were later asked if they had seen the gorilla. Over the years, the film has been shown many times to diverse audiences in many different countries, and the results have remained consistent: roughly half of the subjects fail to see the gorilla! „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe results from the invisible gorilla experiment may seem astonishing. But what‚Äôs even more remarkable was how surprised the subjects were when they found out that they had missed the gorilla. The way we normally experience this world tricks us into believing that we notice everything that is happening around us. It leads us to assume that distinctive or unusual objects will catch our attention, while in reality we are often completely unaware of them. Although only about 5% of the subjects noticed the gorilla, a comprehensive survey suggested that over 7% of them thought that they would surely notice such unexpected objects. In essence, we perceive far less of our world than we think we do. This phenomenon is called the ‚Äúillusion of attention.‚Äù „ÄÄ„ÄÄHow is it that so many people miss something that is so noticeable, something right in front of their eyes? The human brain‚Äôs attention span is limited, which means that when people devote their attention to a specific area or aspect of their surroundings, little or no attention can be allocated to the detection of potential irregular objects or occurrences. In other words, people tend not to notice unexpected objects, even when these appear right where they are looking and thus should be conspicuous. „ÄÄ„ÄÄHere is another good example of the ‚Äúillusion of attention‚Äù phenomenon. In the early 1s, a NASA* scientist was testing the new head-up display* technology in commercial jets by having pilots do simulated landing trials with it on board. This was a new technology that displayed on the windshield the crucial gauges* and dials‚Äînormally located below the windshield, like the speedometer* in your car‚Äîwhich provide much of the crucial information, including the present altitude, velocity* and cabin pressure, needed for flying and landing a plane. In one of the landing trials, the scientist purposely placed another airplane in the middle of the runway. The highly experienced pilots in that trial had a clear view of the airplane and with the aid of their head-up display, they did not even need to look away from the runway to see their instrument panel down below, as they always had had to do before. So it seems there was no way that they could have missed this ‚Äúgorilla.‚Äù Amazingly, however, the pilots failed to see the stationary airplane! Had the scientist not aborted the landing, they would have collided with it. The pilots had focused their attention so much on preparing for the landing that they had neglected the possibility of something unusual taking place right in front of them.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe aforementioned* experiments naturally beg the question: What distinguishes the people who saw the ‚Äúgorilla‚Äù from those who didn‚Äôt? Contrary to popular belief, these experiments are not a measure of intelligence, ability, or personality. Based on the results of the experiment, there was no concrete evidence supporting any correlation between noticing the gorilla and the participants‚Äô IQ*, educational background, gender, or occupation. Anyone is equally likely to miss it. Even though some people saw it, it doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt sometimes miss other ‚Äúgorillas.‚Äù „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe ‚Äúillusion of attention‚Äù teaches us to be wary of our everyday perception. Recognizing the potential discrepancy* between what we think we see and what is actually there is the first step in making better decisions. If we do our best to look for the invisible gorillas around us, we may be surprised at what we find. Who knows? Maybe there is some unexpected object right in front of you now that you have not even noticed! 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄThis is an excerpt from the commencement address delivered by Steve Jobs*, the co-founder and former chief executive officer* of Apple, at Stanford University* on June 1, 2. In this speech, Steve Jobs shares what he learned after having surgery. He talks about how death can be a mechanism for changing one‚Äôs life. No matter how important one may be or whatever one may possess, each person is destined to confront death sooner or later. He urges people to always live each day as if it were their last. He also advises that instead of compromising and accepting the conventional ways, students should pursue what they really want. „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen I was 1, I read a quote that went something like: ‚ÄúIf you live each day as if it were your last, someday you‚Äôll most certainly be right.‚Äù It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 3 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‚ÄúIf today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?‚Äù And whenever the answer has been ‚ÄúNo‚Äù for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something. „ÄÄ„ÄÄRemembering that I‚Äôll be dead soon is the most important tool I‚Äôve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything‚Äîall external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure‚Äîthese things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAbout a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7: in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas*. I didn‚Äôt even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor‚Äôs code for ‚Äúprepare to die.‚Äù It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you‚Äôd have the next 1 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes. „ÄÄ„ÄÄI lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy*, where they stuck an endoscope* down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines*, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated*, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope, the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic* cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and thankfully I‚Äôm fine now. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThis was the closest I‚Äôve been to facing death, and I hope it‚Äôs the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: „ÄÄ„ÄÄNo one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don‚Äôt want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It is life‚Äôs change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true. „ÄÄ„ÄÄYour time is limited, so don‚Äôt waste it living someone else‚Äôs life. Don‚Äôt be trapped by dogma*‚Äîwhich is living with the results of other people‚Äôs thinking. Don‚Äôt let the noise of others‚Äô opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. 
Dina Fossey°¶s Gorillas in the Mist. °@°@In a dense forest in Uganda, Africa, Dian Fossey was with a group of gorillas she had been studying. A huge 450-pound male gorilla named Peanuts sat down near her. Fossey raised one of her arms and scratched herself with the other. Peanuts did the same thing. Then she held out her hand. Uncertain about what to do next, Peanuts reached out and touched Fossey gently with his huge black hand. Then he turned away and ran toward the other gorillas, beating his chest. Fossey just sat there with tears of joy in her eyes. °@°@As a child, Fossey was attached to animals and dreamed about becoming a veterinarian. After her graduation from college, she read about a doctor who had studied gorillas in Africa. The more Fossey read about the gorillas, the more interested she became. In 1963, her trip to Africa, which was supposed to be a vacation, ended up changing her whole life. In Tanzania, Fossey met Mary and Louis Leakey, the famous British anthropologists. The Leakeys believed that by studying gorillas they could acquire more knowledge about humans. If it had not been for the Leakeys, Fossey would not have been so determined to study gorillas. °@°@At the end of 1966, Fossey had a chance to study with British scientist Jane Goodall at a chimpanzee reserve in Tanzania. Fossey later set up her own research station in the Virunga National Park in Congo. This was a very difficult task. Originally the gorillas screamed and ran away when they saw her. But Fossey was patient, and the gorillas eventually let her get close enough to sit and watch them as she wrote her observations in a notebook.  °@°@Unfortunately, Fossey was facing other threats. Due to the unstable political situation in that area, it was very dangerous for a woman alone to undertake such research. Instead of worrying, Fossey enjoyed what she was doing. One day, the park director, who was suspicious of her activities, sent guards to put her under house arrest, which meant that she wasn°¶t allowed to go anywhere without their permission. To come up with a way to get away, Fossey said that she had to go to Uganda to register her car. She succeeded in escaping, obtaining new supplies, and setting up the Karisoke Research Center in the mountains of Rwanda. For the next thirteen years, Fossey lived and worked with the mountain gorillas. Fossey gave us a new and unique view of gorillas in the wild. She discovered that they care for one another and will fight to protect an infant. In general, she found they were peaceful and gentle creatures.      While conducting a count of the gorillas, Fossey discovered that these creatures were on the verge of extinction, as the inhabitants of Rwanda cut down the forests where the gorillas lived for farming, and poachers hunted the gorillas for their skins and to sell them to zoos. Fossey felt devastated when some of her favorite gorillas were killed. By this point, Fossey was becoming weak, and the difficulty of life in the forest was worsening her health. Feeble as she was, she gathered her energy for a new mission. Not long, she returned to the United States to get her strength back and finished writing her book Gorillas in the Mist. Three years after the completion of her book, Fossey went back to Africa. By this time, however, Fossey had many enemies, including the farmers, the poachers, and the park directors who received bribes from the poachers. Even the Rwandan government was against her. °@°@On December 27, 1985, Fossey wasfound murdered in her cabin. She was buried at the Karisoke Research Station next to the gorillas who had been killed in that area. On her grave are the words °ßThe Lady Who Lives Alone in the Forest.°® Sadly, her mission to rescue the gorillas was never accomplished. They are still in great danger today. 
Pride and Prejudice. °@°@°ßIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.°® So begins Jane Austen°¶s Pride and Prejudice, a novel which, although not published until 1813, opens up for us the world of late eighteenth century England. Set in the English countryside roughly thirty miles from London, the novel starts with Mrs. Bennet informing her husband, Mr. Bennet, that the wealthy Bingley family is moving into their neighborhood, Netherfield Park. Mrs. Bennet, whose main purpose in life is to get her daughters married, prompts her husband to pay a visit to the Bingleys, and a few days later Mr. Bingley visits the Bennets with his two sisters and his friend Mr. Darcy. °@°@Later, at a party, the gentlemanly Mr. Bingley becomes very interested in Jane, the oldest of the five Bennet sisters, while Darcy, less socially adept, more proud, and more rude, immediately begins insulting the Bennets°¶ second daughter, Elizabeth. When Bingley suggests that he ask her to dance, Darcy says that he finds Elizabeth only °ßtolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me.°® However, he subsequently begins to realize that she is after all rather attractive and uncommonly intelligent, and he wishes to get to know her better, but she refuses him because of his earlier insults. °@°@In the meantime, the relationship between Jane and Bingley keeps developing, as Bingley finds Jane goodtempered and amiable. Jane becomes ill after riding one rainy day to the Bingleys°¶ on horseback. Forced to stay at the Bingleys°¶ for several days, Jane invites Elizabeth to join her. Elizabeth now has to confront Darcy repeatedly. When he invites her to dance, she replies coldly and ironically: °ßYou wanted me, I know, to say °•Yes,°¶ that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kinds of schemes. ... I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel3 at all.°® But Darcy is increasingly charmed by Elizabeth°¶s quick wit and her frankness in conversation, as opposed to the °ßpretty words°® of other women. °@°@Jane recovers and falls in love with Bingley, while Elizabeth becomes more curious about Darcy. One day, a military officer, Mr. Wickham, meets Elizabeth and accuses Darcy of, in effect, stealing his money, adding that °ßpride had often been his best friend.°® Shocked, Elizabeth now thinks Darcy is malicious and dishonest. She then learns that Bingley may abandon Jane and marry Darcy°¶s sister. One day, while visiting her friend Charlotte, Elizabeth comes across Darcy and his snobbish aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Days later, Darcy boldly proposes marriage to Elizabeth, saying, °ßYou must allow me to say how ardently I admire and love you.°® °@°@Elizabeth, of course, refuses, still assuming that Darcy has convinced Bingley not to marry Jane, and that he has wrongly kept a large sum of money. Yet the very next day, Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter explaining why he has warned Bingley not to marry Jane and how Wickham has lied about the money. Elizabeth now begins to believe him, and she feels ashamed of her failure to see the true natures of Darcy and Wickham. When the latter runs off with Elizabeth°¶s younger sister Lydia, Darcy enables them to marry by paying off Wickham°¶s debts, further endearing him to Elizabeth. °@°@And then everything ends well. After Lydia marries Wickham, Bingley decides he does love Jane after all and they too get married. Jane now says she is °ßthe most fortunate creature that ever existed.°® As for Elizabeth and Darcy, they are clearly very much in love and finally become engaged. Mrs. Bennet is ecstatic about the fact that she will have rich sons-in-law°Xfor while upperclass gentlemen may have been looking for suitable wives, the not-so-rich parents of well-educated, middle-class women were also eager to catch some of these eligible bachelors. °@°@Like Jane Austen herself, late eighteenth century Englishwomen who were able to elevate their status and the quality of their lives by marrying a °ßgentleman°® had to be clever and to possess good social skills. In fact, Austen°¶s young female protagonists, modeled after her, are smarter than most of the men they meet, and we see characters like Elizabeth Bennet sharply criticizing the men with their subtle wit and biting ironies. Therefore, when reading a Jane Austen novel you may sometimes feel that a twenty-first-century woman has gone back to 1790s England in a time machine, where she now finds herself talking to these fancily dressed, too-proud, too-polite English gentlemen, for the author was way ahead of her time. This helps to explain why the novels, which indirectly promote women°¶s rights, are still so enormously popular today. 
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe details1 of the heart, mind, and spirit of Nelson Mandela2, the most prominent2 leader of the African National Congress, are revealed in his electric3, three decade4 long relationship with his ex-wife3, Winnie Madikizela4. Although their marriage5 ended in separation (April, 1992) and divorce6  (March, 1996), reading Mandela‚Äôs letters to Winnie while in jail gives us deep insight7 into what he had experienced as a husband and lover.  April 15, 1976  My dearest Winnie,  Your beautiful photo still stands about two feet above my left shoulder as I write this note. I dust it carefully every morning, for to do so gives me the pleasant feeling that I‚Äôm caressing8 you as in the old days. I even touch your nose with mine to recapture9 the electric current that used to flush through my blood whenever I did so. Nolitha5 stands on the table directly opposite10 me. How can my spirits ever be down when I enjoy the fond11 attentions of such wonderful ladies? October 26, 1976  My dearest Winnie,  „ÄÄ„ÄÄI have been fairly successful in putting on a mask12 behind which I have pined13 for the family, alone, never rushing for the post when it comes until somebody calls out my name. I also never linger after visits although sometimes the urge to do so becomes quite terrible. I am struggling to suppress14 my emotions as I write this letter.  	I have received only one letter since you were detained15, that one dated August 22. You must have had a hard time there. I do not know anything about family affairs16, such as payment17 of rent18, telephone bills19, care of children and their expenses20, whether you will get a job when released. As long as I don‚Äôt hear from you, I will remain worried and dry like a desert21.  ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉI recall the Karoo6 I crossed on several occasions . I saw the desert again in Botswana7 on my way to and from South Africa‚îÄendless8 pits9 of sand and not a drop of water. I have not had a letter from you. I feel dry like a desert.  	Letters from you and the family are like the arrival23 of summer rains and spring that liven10 my life and make it enjoyable11.  	Whenever I write you, I feel that  inside physical warmth, which makes me forget all my problems. I become full of love.  June 26, 1977  My dearest Winnie,  	Our daughters raised in hardship are grown women today. The first-born has her own house and is raising her family.  	We couldn‚Äôt fulfill our wishes, as we had planned, to have a baby boy. I had hoped to build you a refuge24, no matter how small, so that we would have a place for rest and sustenance before the arrival of the sad, dry days. I fell down and couldn‚Äôt do these things. I am as one building castles25 in the air. November 22, 1979  My dearest Winnie,  	You looked really wonderful on 17/11, very much like the woman I married. There was color in your face. Gone was the irritated26 appearance27 and tired look in your eyes when you are under pressure of over-dieting12. As usual, I kept addressing you as Mum13 but my body kept telling me that a woman is sitting across this platform. I felt like singing, even if just to say Hallelujah14! 	
Unit 11  I Have a Dream.      In the past, African-Americans were treated unfairly in the United States. Even after slavery had been abolished, black people were still segregated from white people in public facilities, transportation, and jobs. For example, they were restricted to using only the water fountains with signs marked °ßcolored.°® Additionally, they were forbidden to occupy the seats in the first four rows of a bus. Instead, they had to sit in the rear part of the bus in the colored section. What if the seats were all occupied? Black people had no choice but to surrender their seats to white people. To voice his discontent and show his concern about civil rights, Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his famous speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial. This speech was entitled °ßI Have a Dream.°®      Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great light of hope to millions of Negro slaves, who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.      But one hundred years later, the Negro is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still left in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we°¶ve come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.      Even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American Dream.      I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: °ßWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.°®      I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.      I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.      I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.      I have a dream today!      I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.      I have a dream today!      I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.      This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the sour notes of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.      And when this happens, when we allow freedom [to] ring°Xwhen we let it ring from every village and every community, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God°¶s children°Xblack men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics°Xwill be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: °ßFree at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!°® °XSpeech by Martin Luther King, Jr. Copyright 1963 by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
°@°@In more than 20 years as an allergy1 and asthma1 expert, Dr. Paul Ehrlich2 had never seen a case quite like this one. The patient, a woman in her late twenties, would break out in hives2 at the same time every night¢wright after her husband arrived home from work.  °@°@°ßI think I°¶m allergic1 to him!°® she shouted.  °@°@Ehrlich knew that was impossible; people are not allergic to other people. But what was she reacting to? Her husband°¶s cologne3? A substance3 he was exposed to at work and was transporting home on his clothes?  °@°@Since the patient didn°¶t have a problem before her husband left in the morning, she obviously wasn°¶t allergic to his aftershave4. And since she didn°¶t break out when she dropped by his office, her hives probably weren°¶t directly related to his job, Ehrlich reasoned. On the other hand, they almost certainly had something to do with her husband°¶s weekday activities because the outbreaks4 didn°¶t happen on weekends.  °@°@The mystery was finally solved when Ehrlich asked the patient what her husband ate for lunch. The answer: peanut butter¢wa substance to which, tests later proved, his wife was intensely5 allergic.  °@°@°ßHe would come home, kiss her hello¢wand still have enough of the peanut butter in his system to cause her to break out,°® Ehrlich recalls.  °ßOnce he stopped eating it, the problem was solved.°®  °@°@Welcome to the world of one of New York City°¶s top allergy and asthma experts. This is a man who has to be both a scientist and a detective6 as he sorts through the virtually7 endless list of substances to which patients can be allergic: bugs, pollen5, animals, milk, wine, and shrimp, to name just a few.  °@°@Allergies are no joking matter to the estimated 50 million Americans who have them. Even mild allergic reactions can lead to a series8 of misery9-inducing10 symptoms: runny nose, coughing, sneezing11, watery12 eyes, itching13, rashes14, hives, stomach pain, vomiting15, diarrhea6, and headache. And more severe reactions can be disabling, even life-threatening: asthma affects 17 million Americans and kills 5,400 every year, while another 150 die of allergy-related shock, a sudden, severe, system-wide7 reaction to an allergen such as a food, drug, or insect bite.  What causes allergic reactions? Strangely enough, the culprit8 is the immune16 system. In most cases, it helps the body fight off dangerous invaders such as viruses. But in the case of allergies, the system incorrectly considers a harmless substance, like pollen or a peanut, to be threatening. To defend against it, the body releases a chemical that causes those all-too-familiar allergic symptoms. °@°@The symptoms vary17, depending on what part of the body the reaction takes place in and how much allergen1 is involved. It doesn°¶t have to be much: Even 1/44,000 of a peanut can cause a reaction in someone who is extremely allergic to the nuts18. °@°@Although doctors don°¶t know why some people develop allergies while others don°¶t, they do know that genes19 play an important role. If one of your parents has allergies, you have an increased risk of developing them, too. If both parents have them (even if they are allergic to different substances), your chances skyrocket9. And if you have allergies, you are at significantly higher risk of developing asthma. In addition, allergies and asthma can strike at any age.  °@°@To date, there is no cure for asthma or allergies. However, there are some ways to minimize allergic reactions such as taking medication20 to control the symptoms, receiving injections21 of the allergen to build up the body°¶s tolerance22, or avoiding the allergen altogether. °@°@Ehrlich recalls another case. An Army colonel whose son was allergic to the family dog came to him for help. When Ehrlich told the family that the dog had to go, the colonel was horrified23. °ßIsn°¶t there something else we can do?°® he asked. °@°@Jokingly, Ehrlich suggested sending the son away. Everyone laughed, but several months later, it turned out that they°¶d kept the dog and sent the boy off to a boarding school.  °@°@Ehrlich shakes his head in disbelief24. °ßI even have veterinarian25 patients who are allergic to cats and dogs, he says. °ßIt°¶s great for me, terrible for them. I could make a living just by treating people who love animals.°® 
Unit 6 The LOHAS Era. 	In 2000, the sociologist Paul H. Ray and psychologist Sherry Anderson identified a new movement in consumer culture and, thereby, coined the word °ßLOHAS.°® LOHAS, which stands for °ßLifestyles of Health and Sustainability,°® is a segment of the market that is related to sustainable living. The LOHAS market includes physical products, such as organically grown food, hybrid vehicles, and energy efficient appliances, as well as lifestyle choices, like alternative health care, socially responsible financial investing, and personal development that focuses on the mind, body, and soul. 	As a way of life, LOHAS has a lot to do with individual choices. A typical LOHAS consumer, or sometimes also known as a °ßlohasian,°® has a holistic world view, believing that global economies, cultures, and environments are all connected. Each decision a person makes, whether it°¶s about what kind of apartment to buy or where to take a vacation, has an impact on the entire world. In short, there are many things individuals can do to lead a LOHAS lifestyle. In terms of wellness, individuals can consider what they can do to improve their health. These people are often recommended to pursue activities that balance the body and the mind. Yoga, for example, is perfect for this. Alternative medicine, including the use of food therapies and nutritional supplements, is an excellent way to maintain one°¶s health, too. As for another important element of the LOHAS lifestyle, individuals can make an effort to use recycled or renewable items, if given the option. For instance, buying a table made of waste wood would be much better for the planet. Moreover, thinking carefully about the food that we consume is also important. If individuals eat locally grown food, rather than food that has been grown hundreds of miles away, they can help to significantly reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that is given off by vehicles during the transportation of food. 	In addition to the efforts being made by individuals, businesses are also starting to foster LOHAS values. As a consistent advocate of this idea of sustainability, the Taiwanese company ASUS uses eco-friendly materials in the production of its computers and manufactures computers that consume less energy. ASUS also specializes in recycling old electronics in a way that does not harm the environment. If someone needs to get rid of an old notebook computer, ASUS will dispose of the machine properly so that hazardous chemicals will not be released into the atmosphere. The Japanese company MUJI has devised a smart way to recycle cotton lint, a by-product of spinning mills, to make all-natural clothing, instead of just throwing it away. What°¶s more, MUJI refuses to use non-recyclable PVC and has removed all unnecessary decoration from its products in favor of a simpler design. It is clear that the same principles of LOHAS that are associated with individuals°Xspecifically, reduce, reuse, and recycle°Xare being made manifest in some businesses°Xbut on a much larger scale. 	In another respect, LOHAS can be practiced on a national level as well. Countries worldwide can publicize the importance of LOHAS and influence their citizens through legislation or education. For example, lawmakers can either regulate factories to curb pollution or tax unhealthy foods to encourage healthier eating habits. Should laws be ineffective in influencing the general population, governments can promote LOHAS ideals via education. Taiwan°¶s Ministry of Education has done just this. It has established LOHAS exercise stations in unused classrooms in order to motivate students to get into the habit of exercising. By providing fun activities, like rock climbing programs, educators can do their part to urge on students and even their families in the pursuit of healthier lifestyles. 	By and large, the concept of LOHAS can bring positive results to the world, but what is perhaps most noteworthy is that it starts with each individual. Fortunately, more and more consumers are now seeing the connection between their personal health and the health of the planet. From 2007 to 2008, the number of consumers who prefer natural, biodegradable products grew by 27 percent. Ultimately, each one of us is accountable not only for our own health but for the health of the globe, and those who have adopted a LOHAS lifestyle are making our planet a better place to live. °Xby Junita Bognanni
