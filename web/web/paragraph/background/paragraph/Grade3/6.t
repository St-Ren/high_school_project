Laughter Is the Best Medicine.      The human body has the amazing ability to heal itself. In fact, a doctor who once worked for the New England Journal 1 of Medicine reported that the human body is naturally able to fight off 85 percent of all illnesses2 people can come down with. Many doctors would add that a person¡¦s emotions and mental3 attitude4 may either support5 or hinder6 the body¡¦s ability to heal itself.      Studies focusing on the link7 between emotions and the immune system8 indicate that negative9 attitudes, thoughts10, and emotions weaken11 or depress12 the body¡¦s immune responses. On the other hand, positive13 attitudes, thoughts, and emotions like love, joy, laughter14, and optimism support the body¡¦s immune responses. Particularly in the case of laughter, doctors have found clear evidence to back up the claim15 that it really is the best medicine.      First of all, laughing relaxes the muscles16. As one study showed, people were able to feel more relaxed after watching funny cartoons than after looking at beautiful pictures of nature. But you don¡¦t need a lot of sophisticated17 equipment to test this effect yourself. The next time someone you¡¦re with has a good laugh, ask them how they feel afterwards. Typically18, people respond by describing how relaxed they feel.      Laughter also provides excellent exercise for your heart. After a good laugh, a person¡¦s heart rate19 is well above normal, and it remains high for up to five minutes. For this reason20, some doctors refer to laughter as ¡§internal21 jogging.¡¨       Another key benefit22 of laughter is that it actually boosts23 the immune system by stimulating24 the body¡¦s production of immunoglobulin1 A (IgA). IgA is what the body uses to fight colds and the flu2. Several studies have found that after people watch just thirty minutes of a comedy25 video, the level of IgA in their saliva3 and blood increases. And this effect extends to both adults and children.       Although no studies have been able to show a clear link between laughter and pain reduction, many patients have reported a decrease26 in pain after a good laugh. Some doctors claim this reduction in pain could be linked to chemicals produced in the blood. Or patients might feel less pain because their muscles are more relaxed, or because they are simply distracted27 from thinking about their pain. Whatever the truth28 may be, there are plenty of people who would agree with the comedian Groucho Marx4, who claimed, ¡§A clown5 is like aspirin6, only he works twice as fast.¡¨ 
When Mountains Move.      Growing up in Taiwan, you will be accustomed1 to hearing news of typhoons and the death and destruction they sometimes bring to the island. There is evidence that typhoons are increasing in frequency2 and intensity1, possibly due to global warming. In the future, we might face more events like Typhoon Morakot2, which struck Taiwan on August 8, 2009, killing hundreds of people. Morakot highlighted one of the greatest dangers of a typhoon, namely, the flooding it can bring and, in particular, the possibility of mudslides3 in mountain areas.       During a heavy storm, rainwater may soak into the ground faster than it can run off. The pressure of this extra water can cause soil3 and rocks to become loose. If a large mass of earth breaks loose, it will slide downhill, picking up more soil and rocks and destroying anything in its path. This is more likely if the slope is steep, and especially if it is barren4. When deforestation4 has occurred on a large scale5 in a mountainous area, or if soil conservation6 has been poor, there is a high risk of mudslides. Landslides5 like this are man-made disasters.      There isn¡¦t much that people in Taiwan can do to stop typhoons from striking the island. But the threat of destructive mudslides could be reduced if we take the right action. Landslides are caused by disruption7 of the natural stability8 of a slope. This can result when trees are cut down and replaced by farms, roads, or buildings, for instance. It follows, then, that measures should be taken to keep hillsides stable. These measures might include proper geological6 surveys to identify vulnerable places, the planting of trees to shore up loose soil, and better regulation of agriculture and the construction industry.       These are largely matters of government concern9, but the public can also play a role. People living in high-risk areas should make themselves aware of any emergency or evacuation10 plans that local authorities11 have put in place. During periods of heavy rainfall12, such as when typhoons strike, residents13 need to listen carefully to the radio or watch TV for warnings of intense rain. Mudslides are an extreme danger against which it is necessary to take every possible precaution14. 
Poems of Wisdom. ¡@¡@Poetry, like all forms of literature and art, is capable of opening up new worlds to us. Which world a particular poem opens will depend on the particular type of poem it is. Some poems are descriptive1, meant to give us a deep impression of some idea or image. For example, Emily Dickinson¡¦s ¡§Hope Is the Thing with Feathers¡¨ impresses us with the comparison of hope to a bird, and Joseph Parry¡¦s ¡§New Friends and Old Friends¡¨ uses silver and gold to describe these two types of friends. ¡@¡@Other poems are written so that we can share the poet¡¦s emotional experience, perhaps of love and joy, grief and sorrow, or confusion and conflict2, as that in A. E. Housman¡¦s lines ¡§The heart out of the bosom/Was never given in vain.¡¨ Another type of poem reveals to us some wisdom, as Shelley1 tells us, ¡§If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?¡¨ Or as Victor Hugo writes, ¡§A house is built of logs3 and stone .../A home is built of loving deeds4.¡¨ ¡@¡@Numerous words of wisdom can also be found in Shakespeare¡¦s works, such as, ¡§If all the year were playing holidays/To sport2 would be as tedious5 as to work,¡¨ or ¡§All the world¡¦s a stage,/And all the men and women merely players.¡¨ ¡@¡@The latter type of poetry, poetry of wisdom, can be especially meaningful to us when we are searching for answers to the questions about life. These are poems that we can turn to for guidance and enlightenment6 whenever we feel lost or confused. Many of these lines of wisdom have become proverbs: ¡§Good fences make good neighbors,¡¨ ¡§To err3 is human, to forgive, divine7,¡¨ ¡§What¡¦s done cannot be undone8,¡¨ ¡§The hand that rocks9 the cradle10 is the hand that rules11 the world,¡¨ to list just a few. Following are three examples of such poems of wisdom. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@¡X by Sarah Brooks    Loss and Gain ¡@When I compare ¡@What I have lost with what I have gained, ¡@What I have missed with what attained, ¡@Little room do I find for pride. ¡@ ¡@I am aware ¡@How many days have been idly12 spent; ¡@How like an arrow13 the good intent14 ¡@Has fallen short or been turned aside. ¡@ ¡@But who shall dare ¡@To measure loss and gain in this wise? ¡@Defeat may be victory in disguise15; ¡@The lowest ebb4 is the turn of the tide. ¡@ ¡@¡Xby Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-82) ¡@¡@    Solitude16 ¡@¡@ ¡@Laugh, and the world laughs with you; ¡@Weep, and you weep alone; ¡@For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth5, ¡@But has trouble enough of its own. ¡@Sing, and the hills will answer; ¡@Sigh, it is lost on the air; ¡@The echoes bound17 to a joyful sound, ¡@But shrink18 from voicing19 care. ¡@ ¡@Rejoice6, and men will seek you; ¡@Grieve20, and they turn and go; ¡@They want full measure of all your pleasure, ¡@But they do not need your woe7. ¡@Be glad, and your friends are many; ¡@Be sad, and you lose them all¡X ¡@There are none to decline21 your nectared8 wine, ¡@But alone you must drink life¡¦s gall9. ¡@ ¡@Feast, and your halls are crowded; ¡@Fast10, and the world goes by, ¡@Succeed and give, and it helps you live, ¡@But no man can help you die. ¡@There is room in the halls of pleasure ¡@For a large and lordly11 train12, ¡@But one by one we must all file22 on ¡@Through the narrow aisles13 of pain. ¡@ ¡@¡Xby Ella Wheeler Wilcox (1850-1919)    Fable ¡@¡@ ¡@The mountain and the squirrel23 ¡@Had a quarrel24, ¡@And the former called the latter ¡§Little Prig14.¡¨ ¡@Bun15 replied, ¡@¡§You are doubtless very big; ¡@But all sorts of things and weather ¡@Must be taken in together, ¡@To make up a year ¡@And a sphere16. ¡@And I think it no disgrace ¡@To occupy my place. ¡@If I¡¦m not so large as you, ¡@You are not so small as I, ¡@And not half so spry17. ¡@I¡¦ll not deny you make ¡@A very pretty squirrel track25; ¡@Talents differ; all is well and wisely put; ¡@If I cannot carry forests on my back, ¡@Neither can you crack a nut.¡¨ ¡@ ¡@¡Xby Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-82)
Don¡¦t Hold Back Your Tears. ¡@¡@Crying is a normal, natural part of human life. The first sounds a newborn baby makes are cries, and crying is a baby¡¦s only means of communicating until it begins to coo and babble at nine to twelve weeks of age. ¡@¡@Crying is most often associated with grief, rage, and sadness, but as many athletes will attest, frustration and joy can also trigger tears. The fact is, when faced with an overwhelming emotion, almost anyone will burst into tears. Of course, we are much more accustomed to seeing women weep, and in most cultures men who cry are seen as unmanly. This, however, has not always been the case. ¡@¡@In ancient Greece, Aristotle believed that crying led to emotional cleansing. In Greek mythology, heroes sob shamelessly over their fallen comrades-in-arms, and fathers as well as mothers lament their children¡¦s deaths with tears rolling down their cheeks. But by the time of the Industrial Revolution, tears had become a sign of weakness, and men were seldom seen crying in public. This tendency has continued into modern times. In the 1972 U.S. presidential primaries, Edmund Muskie was seen crying in front of the media while defending his wife against personal verbal attacks. Many believe that those tears lost him the election that year. ¡@¡@However, as a sign of how things have changed, Bill Clinton shed tears on a number of occasions during his term as president and even won support for showing his sensitive side to the nation. Perhaps society is beginning to recognize that crying may in fact be good for us. ¡@¡@Almost all animals shed tears, but many believe that only humans shed tears under emotional duress. Although some say that other animals, like elephants and seals, cry when they feel pain, there is little scientific proof that these tears are caused by emotions. They are most likely basal tears or reflex tears. Basal tears are tears that keep the eyes from drying up, and they fight bacterial infection. Reflex tears are created when our eyes are bothered by irritants, like pollen or dust. While humans, of course, do shed these kinds of tears, we also have the unique ability to create emotional tears. ¡@¡@Emotional tears differ from basal or reflex tears in their chemical composition. They contain far more toxins and hormones than other kinds of tears. This fact has led scientists to believe that crying emotional tears has a cleansing and curative effect, as well as providing an emotional outlet, much as Aristotle believed 2,500 years ago. ¡@¡@By crying, we vent our anguish and grief. This, combined with the fact that the tears themselves are carrying poisons and toxins out of our bodies, makes crying an important part of dealing with stress. It¡¦s important to realize that holding back tears may be bad for our mental health. Today more and more public figures, even men, seem willing to show their sensitivity to people¡¦s emotional needs, and society is beginning to recognize that crying is a natural way of coping with pain, stress, and sorrow. Nowadays, ¡§put on a brave face¡¨ or ¡§keep a stiff upper lip¡¨ may not always be the wisest¡Xthat is, the healthiest¡Xpolicy. Thinking More Try to think of an instance in which a person sheds some crocodile tears. 
From Head to Foot. ¡@¡@Soccer¡Xwhich is called football outside of the United States and Canada¡Xis the world¡¦s most popular sport. It is played in parks, fields, schools, and streets all over the world. It has about 250 million male and female players in more than two hundred countries, and it has even more fans. In fact, it has become the world¡¦s most-watched televised sporting event, even surpassing the Olympics. ¡@¡@The exact origins of modern soccer are unknown. However, records indicate that the Chinese and Japanese played similar games over two thousand years ago. Later, the ancient Greeks and Romans played it. The Romans took the game to Britain, which became the undisputed birthplace of modern soccer. ¡@¡@In Britain, the game came to be called football, because only the players¡¦ feet could touch the ball. However, when the British played football, it was more like war than a game. Towns and villages played against one another, and sometimes up to five hundred people played on each team. There were even annual contests where large groups ran wildly from village to village playing the game. One game could last all day. Naturally, many people were injured and some even died. Several kings legally banned the game because it was so rough, and because soldiers preferred to play it rather than concentrate on their military training. Even Queen Elizabeth had players in London put in jail because they caused so much damage to shops and public property when they played football in the streets. But the game was too popular to be stopped. ¡@¡@The Football Association of England was formed in 1863. At that time, university students liked to create slang terms by adding ¡§-er¡¨ to words they shortened. The name soccer developed from adding ¡§-er¡¨ to the letters S, O, and C (from the word association). However, the game is still known as football in most parts of the world except for most of North America, where ¡§soccer¡¨ is more commonly used. Football quickly became popular throughout Europe and South America, and in 1900 it became one of the first team sports played in the Olympic Games. ¡@¡@In 1904, seven nations¡XBelgium, Spain, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Switzerland¡Xmet in Paris to form FIFA, the Federation International de Football Association. FIFA has been the governing body of the sport ever since. Today, it has 204 member countries. Every four years, the world¡¦s strongest national football teams compete to become world champions by winning the World Cup¡Xa golden trophy. The World Cup tournament was started in 1930. Beginning in 1958, it was held alternately in Europe and the Americas, but since 2002 it has been held in Asian and African countries as well. ¡@¡@Throughout history, football was considered unsuitable for women in Europe, and they were banned from playing it. However, in the 1970s women were finally allowed to play, and the sport¡¦s popularity started to grow. This trend has continued. Since 1996, women¡¦s football has been included in the Olympic Games, and today more than seven million girls play in the United States alone. The United States, though a newcomer to the women¡¦s game, has won the World Cup twice and has also won two Olympic gold medals and one silver medal. ¡@¡@Football was first introduced to Brazil by a British man named Charles Miller, who started a team there. In 1899, this team played the country¡¦s first recorded game of football. Today, football is a way of life in Brazil. The Brazilian team was the first team to win the World Cup five times, and it has more professional teams than any other country in the world. Its most talented players, including Pele, Garrincha, Zico, and many others, have made Brazil legendary throughout the world. ¡@¡@Brazil is not the only country with football stars. Britain¡¦s David Beckham has become an idol for many young people. They read about him in various publications and want to copy his latest hairstyle. In Tokyo, a giant three-meter statue of Beckham made entirely of chocolate was made to promote a new kind of chocolate. Advertisers use him to sell many things, and of course he makes millions of dollars from each advertising contract. ¡@¡@Football is one of the oldest sports in the world. It has been gaining fans around the globe for over two thousand years, and it doesn¡¦t show any signs of letting up. Will football continue to be the most popular sport in the world? Most people think it will! 
Unit 12  A Lesson in Communication¡Xand a Taste of Drama. Time: Evening. Place: The living room of an ordinary apartment. The Gao family is relaxing after supper. Mr. Gao: (casually) So what¡¦s new in school, Ping? Ping: (shrugs) Nothing much¡Xexcept that we have been guiding the juniors through a drama contest. Mrs. Gao: (interested) A drama contest? Wow, that should be fun! Mr. Gao: Yeah. (winking at Mrs. Gao) Your mom starred in an English play while she was in college. Ping: (interested) Really, Mom? Cool! What was the play? Mrs. Gao: (a bit shy) Aw, that was a long time ago. (lost in memory) But I still remember the play vividly. It¡¦s called The Glass Menagerie. Ping: The Glass Menagerie? What a weird title! Mrs. Gao: Sounds strange, doesn¡¦t it? It¡¦s the play that made Tennessee Williams famous, though. Ping: Tennessee Williams? Who¡¦s he? Mr. Gao: Well, I¡¦m not surprised that you¡¦ve never heard of him. He was born almost a century ago¡X Mrs. Gao: (smiling) He was born in 1911 and died in 1983. Mr. Gao: (a bit surprised) Wow, you have a good memory indeed! Mrs. Gao: And Tennessee Williams is one of the most important playwrights in American theater. Ping: (genuinely interested) Really? Maybe we can recommend this play to the juniors. Mrs. Gao: Hmm, I¡¦m not so sure about that. It is rather a sad story. What¡¦s more, there actually aren¡¦t that many characters in the play. Ping: What is the play about? Mrs. Gao: Well, it¡¦s a long story, Ping, but I¡¦ll try to make it short. Born slightly disabled, Laura is an extremely shy and quiet girl. She lives with her mother, Amanda, and her brother, Tom, but she keeps herself in her own small world of a ¡§glass menagerie¡¨¡X Mr. Gao: (interrupting) That is, a collection of animals made out of glass. Mrs. Gao: Yes. Concerned about Laura¡¦s future, Amanda talks Tom into inviting his friends over, so that Laura can find someone to marry. (after a short pause) The ¡§gentleman callers,¡¨ as they are called. Ping: Ah, I know. Tom the matchmaker finds a perfect man for his sister, and they live happily ever after. (giggles) Mrs. Gao: Not so fast, young lady! (half seriously) And don¡¦t interrupt if you want to hear the story. Ping: (jokingly) Yes, ma¡¦am! Mrs. Gao: One day, Tom brings his best friend Jim home for dinner, and much to Amanda¡¦s delight¡X Mr. Gao: (chiming in) But Laura is frightened out of her wits, for this ¡§gentleman caller¡¨ happens to be her high school idol. Ping: Ah, I would be scared to death, too, if I were Laura! (catches herself) Sorry, Mom, I didn¡¦t mean to interrupt. Please go on. (can¡¦t help herself) Do they fall in love? Mrs. Gao: That¡¦s the sad part of it. Just after Jim is able to restore some self-confidence in Laura, he tells her that he is already engaged to another girl . . . Ping: Oh, no . . . (Silence follows.) Mr. Gao: It doesn¡¦t have the kind of happy ending that many people expect of a love story. It is a stirring play. Ping: Which role did you play, Mom? Did you play Laura? Mr. Gao: (nodding) You guessed right, smart girl! Ping: Did you hate Jim, Mom, when he told you he was getting married? Mrs. Gao: Hate him? (winks at Mr. Gao) Of course not! As Laura, I was disappointed, to be sure¡Xvery disappointed, I should say. But why would I hate him? It was just a misunderstanding. Mr. Gao: Right. I mean, Tom doesn¡¦t know that Jim already has a steady relationship with another girl, let alone that they are getting married soon. Mrs. Gao: In fact, in my role of Laura, I was very grateful to Jim for instilling some confidence into me¡Xeven though it was for just a short while. Ping: (puzzled) I don¡¦t understand . . . Mr. Gao: Let me show you how Jim is able to help Laura overcome her initial shyness and become as eloquent and self-confident as she has never been, perhaps in her entire life. (He gets up and picks up a book from the bookshelf.) (Light dims downstage, revealing Jim and Laura, upstage, in an American living room of the 1930s.) [Excerpted from The Glass Menagerie, Scene VII] Jim: Everybody excels in some one thing. Some in many! (unconsciously glancing at himself in the mirror) All you¡¦ve got to do is discover in what! Take me, for instance. (He adjusts his tie at the mirror.) My interest happens to lie in electrodynamics. I¡¦m taking a course in radio engineering at night school, Laura, on top of a fairly responsible job at the warehouse. I¡¦m taking that course and studying public speaking. Laura: Ohhhh. Jim: Because I believe in the future of television! (turning his back to her) I wish to be ready to go up right along with it. Therefore, I¡¦m planning to get in on the ground floor. In fact I¡¦ve already made the right connections, and all that remains is for the industry itself to get under way! Full steam¡X(His eyes are starry.) Knowledge¡XZzzzzp! Money¡XZzzzzp!¡XPower! That¡¦s the cycle democracy is built on! (His attitude is convincingly dynamic. Laura stares at him, even her shyness eclipsed in her absolute wonder. He suddenly grins.) I guess you think I think a lot of myself! Laura: No¡Xo-o-o, I¡X Jim: Now how about you? Isn¡¦t there something you take more interest in than anything else? Laura: Well, I do¡Xas I said¡Xhave my¡Xglass collection¡X Jim: I¡¦m not right sure I know what you¡¦re talking about. Laura: Little articles of it, they¡¦re ornaments mostly! Most of them are little animals made out of glass, the tiniest little animals in the world. Mother calls them a glass menagerie! Here¡¦s an example of one, if you¡¦d like to see it! This one is one of the oldest. It¡¦s nearly thirteen. (Jim stretches out his hand.) Oh, be careful¡Xif you breathe, it breaks! Jim: I¡¦d better not take it. I¡¦m pretty clumsy with things. Laura: Go on, I trust you with him! (Places it in his palm.) There now¡Xyou¡¦re holding him gently! Hold him over the light¡Xhe loves the light! You see how the light shines through him? Jim: It sure does shine! Laura: I shouldn¡¦t be partial, but he is my favorite one. Jim: What kind of a thing is this one supposed to be? Laura: Haven¡¦t you noticed the single horn on his forehead? Jim: A unicorn, huh? Laura: Mm-hmmm! Jim: Unicorns, aren¡¦t they extinct in the modern world? Laura: I know! Jim: Poor little fellow, he must feel sort of lonesome. Laura: Well, if he were to be able to talk, he would not complain about it. He stays on a shelf with some horses that don¡¦t have horns, and all of them seem to get along nicely together. Jim: How do you know? Laura: I haven¡¦t heard any arguments among them! (Light dims upstage, revealing the Gao family downstage.) Ping: Bravo! (They all applaud.) Mr. Gao: Isn¡¦t it great the way Jim leads Laura to overcome her nervousness to express herself? Mrs. Gao: Yes, very gently and skillfully he makes Laura talk about the subject she is familiar with¡Xher collection of animals, the glass menagerie. Ping: Indeed. I saw her face brighten up gradually until she seems very much at ease. She¡¦s even humorous toward the end! Mr. Gao: Yes. It¡¦s a good lesson in communication for all of us. Mrs. Gao: And guess who played Jim? (Mr. and Mrs. Gao look at each other and burst into laughter that they try unsuccessfully to suppress.) Ping: (unbelievable) It can¡¦t be you, can it, Dad? (Light dims as the laughter continues.) ¡XBy Ching-Hsi Perng. With an excerpt from The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams 
Is your closet stuffed with comic books?  Are a dozen metal slogan1 buttons2 pinned3 to your backpack?  Do you have a box filled with miniature4 cars under your bed?  Do you keep a scrapbook1 of every birthday card you¡¦ve ever received?  If your answer is ¡§yes,¡¨ then you are a collector5! ¡@¡@Collecting is a great hobby and there are many different kinds of wonderful things to collect.  Even better, many collections5 increase in value over the years. But that is not the main reason to become a collector.  More importantly, people just collect for fun! ¡@¡@Comic books are one of the most popular collectibles5.  There are so many comics in existence¢wwith more being issued every month¢wthat no one can hope to collect them all.  Often collectors will keep only certain kinds of comics, depending on their interests. ¡@¡@A new collectible hit the scene6 in the late 1880s, when the first baseball cards were published.  Today, cards are available7 for almost every sport.  And some of them are very valuable¢wa 1952 Mickey Mantle2 baseball card in mint condition can sell for more than $25,000! ¡@¡@Also very popular are trading cards that feature hundreds of non-sport subjects, such as comic-book characters, beetles, and dinosaurs.  ¡@¡@Is paper money your favorite paper item? Then why not collect it?  Paper bills from around the world come in many sizes, colors, and designs.  Ask friends or relatives8 who travel to bring you bills from the places they visit.  If you have pen pals in other countries, exchange currency9 with them. ¡@¡@ Stickers4 are colorful, cheap, and easy to find.  Because there are thousands of designs to choose from, it is important to organize your collection by theme10 or in some other way. Collecting autographs11 of famous people has been a popular hobby for thousands of years.  Today, athletes, actors, musicians, and politicians get lots of mail asking for their autographs. ¡@¡@Other paper items that make interesting collections include pop-up5 books, paper dolls, and ticket stubs6 from sporting events. ¡@¡@Round metal buttons with pictures or slogans printed on them are probably kids¡¦ favorite kind of collectible5 pins.  These buttons were first used in the 1800s in political campaigns. Today the buttons are made in a seemingly endless variety of colors and themes. ¡@¡@Patches, too, come in many styles and designs. The scouts13, fire departments, schools, and military units produce interesting patches. ¡@¡@Many young collectors collect dolls or action figures. Popular collectible dolls include those with brand names, such as Barbie7.  Then there are celebrity14 dolls, portrait15 dolls of presidents and their wives, ethnic16 dolls wearing traditional outfits17, dolls with china or porcelain8 heads, rag18 dolls, animal dolls¢wthe list goes on and on. ¡@¡@An empty shelf19 becomes a tiny world of pleasure when filled with a collection of models or miniatures4. It can display a zoo of wild animals, a battle scene with armies of toy soldiers, or a town complete with houses and railroad trains. Dollhouses9, filled with furniture20 and miniature people, also make delightful collections. ¡@¡@A fun way to remember vacations and at the same time build a collection is to gather souvenirs21 when you travel.  There are many possibilities, including key chains, hats, T-shirts10, refrigerator magnets22, etc. ¡@¡@Postcards are very popular. Some people collect postcards from places they visit.  Others ask friends to send them postcards from their trips.  Another possibility is to collect by theme¢wfor example, postcards of beaches, birds, historic sites, or amusement parks. ¡@¡@As you can see, anything can become a collectible.  Whatever collections you decide to have, you¡¦ll have the fun of hunting for treasures and perhaps even the joy of sharing them with friends. 
Unit 2 Our True Self Lies Within. 	Researchers in the United States of America once conducted a psychological study called the ¡§Scar Experiment,¡¨ which ended up provoking a lot of public discussion. In this experiment, the researchers notified ten volunteers that the objective was to observe how people would respond when they saw someone with a physical defect, particularly those with scars on their faces. After being informed of the purpose of the study, these participants were placed in ten small rooms in which no mirrors could be found. There, a Hollywood make-up artist put a gruesome scar on the left cheek of each participant. Then, the make-up artist showed the participant his or her new look in the mirror. Next, the participants were told that for fear that the make-up might come off, a sticky substance would be applied. The scar, however, was actually then swept away without the subjects¡¦ knowledge. 	Later, these unsuspecting participants were sent off to the waiting rooms of different clinics to experience how people would react to them. When returning to the research laboratory, they reported that people were unfriendly and repeatedly peeked at their scars. As a matter of fact, these volunteers looked the same as normal. Their consciousness of other people¡¦s unkind acts came from their own assumptions: They believed that the scar would unavoidably draw the public¡¦s attention and make people treat them rudely and offensively. In other words, they were influenced by a sense of inferiority. 	The sense of inferiority, according to the researchers, is strongly associated with the environment in which one develops. A study indicated that in a traditional Chinese family, a child would finally get a compliment only after receiving ten savage lectures. At a Chinese school, the chances of students being scolded are seven times higher than those of being acclaimed. If children get criticized continually as they mature, they are bound to face an identity crisis and may even start to disapprove of themselves in the course of time. As kids grow up, negative remarks can become mental scars. These negative remarks can also bruise their egos, undermine their confidence, and, hence, affect how they see themselves. 	A boy once sadly told his mother that due to the pimples all over his face, he was not popular with his classmates. No matter how hard she tried to reason with him, it seemed that the boy wasn¡¦t open to any form of persuasion. Were the pimples the real reason why he and his classmates didn¡¦t get along? Absolutely not! It turned out that the boy¡¦s father had been so worried and anxious that he had brought up the boy in a negative way, and the father¡¦s long-term biting comments had led to the boy¡¦s sense of inferiority and had greatly impacted the boy¡¦s judgment. For fear of being isolated, the boy had mistakenly blamed his unpopularity on the pimples. 	On the other hand, Lena Maria, the author of Footnotes: A Life Without Limits, was born with only one leg and without any upper limbs. Even so, she was raised as if she were not physically challenged at all. Her parents¡¦ love for her knew no bounds, and this made her appreciate her life, no matter how limited it would be. What¡¦s more, her cheerful mentality adds fullness to her life. Thus, she has never felt different from others, in spite of her birth defects. One day, a girl in her class intended to embarrass her by sarcastically saying, ¡§Good morning, the girl with only one leg.¡¨ Not even upset, Lena replied with a beaming smile, ¡§Good morning, two-legged girl.¡¨ 	Whether we are facially scarred or physically deficient in some other way, others can¡¦t hurt our feelings on condition that we embrace ourselves. However, if we deprive ourselves of our own self-esteem and regard ourselves as unworthy, then a trivial pimple on the face can cause us to have insecurity problems in our relationships. So, don¡¦t let a sense of inferiority, a scar, or even a pimple steer you wrong. After all, people see you just the way you see yourself. ¡XBy J. P. Raptor
Unit 3 Three Days to See. 	I have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days at some time during his or her early adult life. Darkness would make this person more grateful for sight; silence would teach this individual the joys of sound. 	Recently, I was visited by a very good friend of mine. I asked her what she had observed from a long walk in the woods. ¡§Nothing in particular,¡¨ she replied. Had I not been accustomed to such responses, I might have been incredulous, for long ago I became convinced that the seeing see little. 	How was it possible to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing worthy of note? I, who cannot see, find hundreds of things to interest me through mere touch. I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf. In spring, I touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud, the first sign of awakening nature after her winter¡¦s sleep. Occasionally, if I am very fortunate, I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel the happy quiver of a bird in full song. 	It is human, perhaps, to appreciate little that which we have and to long for that which we don¡¦t have, but it is a great pity that in the world of light, the gift of sight is used only as a mere convenience, rather than as a means of adding fullness to life. If, by some miracle, I were granted three seeing days, I should divide the period into three parts. 	On the first day, I should want to see the people whose kindness, gentleness, and companionship have made my life worth living. First, I should like to gaze long upon the face of my dear teacher, Mrs. Anne Sullivan Macy, who came to me when I was a child and opened the outer world to me. I should want not merely to see the outline of her face, so that I could cherish it in my memory, but to study that face and find in it the living evidence of the sympathetic tenderness and patience with which she accomplished the difficult task of my education. I should like to see in her eyes that strength of character which has enabled her to stand firm in the face of the plight and that compassion for all humanity which she has revealed to me so often. 	On the second day of sight, I should devote my time to a hasty glimpse of the world, past and present, through museums. I should try to investigate the soul of man through his art. The whole magnificent world of painting would be opened to me, from the Italian Primitives, with their serene religious devotion, to the Moderns, with their feverish visions. I should look deep into the canvases of Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci. I should want to feast my eyes upon the warm colors of Veronese. Oh, there is so much rich meaning and beauty in the art of the ages for you who have eyes to see! 	On my third and last day of sight, I should spend this day in the workday world of the present, so the city becomes my destination. From Fifth Avenue, I would make a tour of the city¡Xto Park Avenue, to the slums, to factories, to the parks where children play. My eye would strive to touch and hold closely each thing its gaze rested upon. Some sights would be pleasant, filling the heart with happiness; some would be miserably pathetic. To the latter, I would not shut my eyes, for they, too, are part of life. To close the eye on them is to close the heart and mind. 	I can give one warning to those who see: Use your eyes as if tomorrow you would be stricken blind. And the same method can be applied to other senses. Hear the music of voices, the song of a bird, the vigorous strains of an orchestra, as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow. Touch each object you want to touch as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail. Smell the perfume of flowers, taste with enjoyment each scrap of food, as if tomorrow you could never smell or taste again. Make the most of every sense¡Xglory in all the aspects of pleasure and beauty which the world reveals to you through the several means of contact which nature provides. But of all the senses, I am sure that sight must be the most delightful. ¡XAdapted from ¡§Three Days to See¡¨ by Helen Keller.
