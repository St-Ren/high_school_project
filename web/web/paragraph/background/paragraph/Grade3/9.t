On Top Of the World.      Imagine the amount of practice, effort, and courage it would take to climb to the top of Mount Everest1. Now imagine how hard it would be if you were blind. Most people would consider it to be simply impossible, but that is just what Erik Weihenmayer2 did in May 2001. And this climb was no °ßoneoff3°®; Weihenmayer has been climbing mountains, skydiving, and skiing since he was a teenager.      Born in 1968 with an eye disease called retinoschisis4, Weihenmayer was totally blind by the age of thirteen. However, throughout1 his childhood, his parents encouraged him to live as normal a life as possible, sending him to regular schools rather than ones for the sight-impaired2. And Erik himself simply refused to let his blindness interfere3 with his determination to do what he loved. He continued his active lifestyle and in high school discovered wrestling5, something at which he could compete on equal terms with sighted4 people.   In 1987, Weihenmayer graduated from high school as the second  best wrestler in the whole state, and he went on to study at Boston College. By 1993 he had a master°¶s degree6 in education and was a teacher and wrestling coach5. He was an inspirational6 teacher, passing on his personal philosophy of focusing on the possibilities of life rather than the limitations. As he says, °ßI believe in being the best at the things I can do, and letting go of the things I can°¶t do. I know I will never drive a car and I will never catch a baseball, but there are lifetimes and lifetimes of achievement7 awaiting8 me, so I have more than enough to keep me busy.°®    And he has certainly kept himself busy. In 1996 he was selected to carry the Olympic torch7 through the city of Phoenix8. And he is the only sight-impaired man to have climbed the seven summits. After his ascent9 of Everest in 2001, he became world famous.  Weihenmayer wrote about his mountain-climbing adventures in an extraordinary book, Touch the Top of the World, published in 2002. The story he tells is not only inspiring, but also entertaining. The reader can clearly sense his personal charm as well as his sense of humor. Much of the proceeds10 from this book and his other best-selling books and motivational speeches have gone to help the visually impaired in both the United States and around the world. It is no surprise that in 2008 Weihenmayer was voted one of the twenty most inspirational people in America. 
The Trojan War. °@°@The Trojan War1, though it occurred thousands of years ago, is one of the most famous wars of all time. The images of this war have been clearly etched1 in people°¶s minds for centuries: images of the beautiful Helen of Troy2, of the magnificent Trojan horse, of the violent burning of the city of Troy. But do these images come from myth or from reality2? Was the Trojan War just a wonderful story, set down by the imaginative3 Greek poet Homer3 in the 9th century B.C.? Or did it really happen? °@°@There is evidence that this heroic4 battle did take place. Archeologists discovered the city of Troy in 1871, and found in the course of their diggings that the city had been destroyed by a fire in 1250 B.C., the time of the Trojan War. This discovery led people to believe that the events Homer described were based on actual history, although the writer certainly gave these events a myth-like quality that continues to hold our imaginations so many centuries later. °@°@Now, with the help of Homer°¶s epic5 poem, let°¶s imagine what the ancient Greeks and Trojans might have thought and said and experienced at the time of the Trojan War. °@°@Agamemnon4 had never before seen his brother, Menelaus5, so angry. Menelaus now stood at the foot of Agamemnon°¶s throne, his eyes blazing6 with fury. °@°@°ßShe°¶s gone,°® said Menelaus. °@°@°ßWho°¶s gone?°® asked Agamemnon. °@°@°ßHelen,°® Menelaus responded through clenched7 teeth. °ßHelen is gone, and I believe she is now with Paris6, the Prince of Troy.°®  °@°@At these words, Agamemnon°¶s face lit up. An evil smile slowly spread across his features. °@°@°ßSo Paris has stolen your precious wife? He has stolen the wife of the king of Sparta7?°® Agamemnon asked with a deep growl8. °@°@°ßYes, brother,°® replied Menelaus, °ßand I am prepared to go to war to get her back. I have come to ask for your help.°® °@°@Agamemnon laughed. As a king himself, of the Greek city-state8 of Mycenae9, he had long hoped for a reason to wage9 a war against the city of Troy. He had long wished to be the one man who could take such a city, as rich and beautiful and strong as it was. No one had ever been able to get beyond its huge, soaring10 stone walls. Kings and armies had tried, but none had succeeded. If Agamemnon could succeed, he would become the most powerful of all kings. °@°@°ßOf course, Menelaus,°® Agamemnon said after a brief silence. °ßI will help you.°®  °@°@Within a week, Agamemnon had gathered a huge army, and they set sail for Troy in a fleet11 of one thousand ships. This would be a war that would never be forgotten. °@°@Priam10, the king of Troy, looked at his son in anger and disappointment. °@°@°ßParis, what have you done?°® he demanded. °ßYou have stolen the wife of Menelaus, Agamemnon°¶s brother! Do you realize what this means?°® °@°@Of course Paris realized. He and Priam both knew that Agamemnon was their enemy. °@°@°ßAt this very moment,°® Priam said, °ßAgamemnon is preparing an army. He will sail for Troy without delay. Our city could be destroyed.°® °@°@Paris was silent. °@°@°ßSpeak! What do you have to say for yourself?°® °@°@Paris could only smile weakly. He looked up at his father. °@°@°ßFather, I am in love.°® °@°@The King sighed and turned to look out the window of his palace. He looked down at his city, and then gazed out at the ocean°Xthe ocean that would carry Agamemnon°¶s army to his kingdom. Priam loved Troy. °@°@He turned his face back toward Paris. He also loved his son. He spoke again. This time the harshness was gone from his voice. °@°@°ßHelen is indeed the most beautiful woman in the world. I can understand why you should fall in love with her. The walls of Troy are tall and strong. No army has ever conquered us. I can only hope these walls will again protect us. When Agamemnon arrives, we will fight. May the gods help us.°® °@°@Paris bowed his head. °ßThank you, Father.°® °@°@The war against Troy went on for ten years. Agamemnon and his army attacked relentlessly12, but the walls of the city were too strong. Finally, Agamemnon realized that the only way he could conquer Troy was to find another way to get inside the city. °@°@°ßWe will deceive them,°® Agamemnon told his army. °@°@His plan was this: The Greek army would retreat, as if they had given up, and pretend to be sailing home. They would hide their ships somewhere nearby. Then, secretly, they would take a giant wooden horse to the gates of the city. The Trojans would see the horse and think it was a tribute13 from the losing army. They would think that they had won the war and would gaily11 bring this amazing gift into the city. Perhaps they would dance around it to celebrate their victory. And that night, for the first time in a decade, they would sleep soundly14. °@°@Agamemnon°¶s plan worked perfectly. King Priam himself gave the order to push the wooden horse within the city walls. He wished his citizens to enjoy this trophy15 of victory. And after a great celebration, the people of Troy did sleep soundly, just as Agamemnon had hoped. °@°@But as they slept, in the dark quiet of the night, there emerged16 from inside the horse a group of stealthy17 Greek warriors18. They quickly made their way to the entrance of the city and opened the huge gates. The rest of the army was waiting outside. The Trojan people did not have a chance. The Greek warriors killed every man in Troy. They took the women and children as slaves. They stole all of the valuables they could find, and then set the city on fire. Agamemnon wished for not one trace to be left of the grandeur12 that was once Troy. As for Menelaus, the betrayal19 he had suffered was now revenged. As the ships sailed home, they returned carrying the beautiful Helen. She had been recaptured20, and was being taken back to her home in Sparta.  °@°@In Helen, however, the Trojans perhaps gained one small victory. They would be immortalized21 by this woman who brought their city to ruin. She would never again be known as Helen, the queen of Sparta. Instead, she would go down in history as Helen of Troy. 
A Trip to Lanyu. °@°@The weather was fine. We six city people were getting ready to land on Lanyu1, also known as Orchid Island2, in a small, propeller-driven3 airplane. All of us were eager to explore this small and isolated place, located off the southeastern coast of Taiwan. As we came closer, we could see the landscape of weathered1 coastal rocks, rivers, and volcanoes. We got a glimpse2 of Lanyu°¶s tropical rain forest°Xthe only rain forest existing on any of the islands near Taiwan. Our eyes were also searching the coast for any signs of the aboriginal people that populate3 Lanyu, the peace-loving Tao4, whose isolation from the outside world has helped to preserve their traditional culture and also allowed them to maintain4 their home as a self-sufficient paradise on the sea. °@°@No sooner had we landed than we made arrangements to hire5 scooters, as they provide the most convenient way to enjoy the island°¶s primitive scenery. While riding along, we saw unusual rock formations6 and caves7, and also caught frequent glimpses of soaring birds and flitting5 butterflies, including unusual species such as the Lanyu birdwings6 that are native to Orchid Island. We stopped every so often to observe some rare insect or plant. We also frequently gave way to goats and pigs strolling across the road. With no traffic lights on the island, these animals seem to provide an effective system of traffic control. We stopped as well at several villages along the way, where we were warmly greeted by the hospitable8 Tao people and invited for a meal of flying fish. It was easy to tell that it was flying fish season, as we could see the fish hanging on wooden shelves9 and poles10 in front of almost every house. °@°@Continuing along the road, which runs thirty-six kilometers around the island, we came across a beachside display of the colorful canoes11 that are the Tao people°¶s primary fishing vessel and one of the prides of their culture. Special care goes into making these boats. They are composed of twenty-one or twenty-seven wooden planks7 assembled12 without the use of nails. The assembly and decorating of the boats takes place at an annual contest13 held every June. There is a launching ritual at which the male villagers wear their traditional loincloths8 and the women, also dressed in traditional garments14, sing and dance. The ceremony is solemn15, yet full of energy and beauty. °@°@Our round-the-island trip also took us past a number of traditional Tao houses. °@°@We were lucky enough to be able to visit one of these unusual semi-subterranean9 dwellings16, which are built in a shallow17 excavation10 that allows only the roof to show. We learned that this ingenious18 method of construction19 keeps the house cool in summer, warm in winter, and nearly impervious11 to the fierce typhoons that strike the island frequently from May through September. °@°@On the second day of our trip, we went snorkeling12 and enjoyed another of Lanyu°¶s best tourist activities. Diving20 below the surface of the water, we were amazed at the colorful tropical fish and stunning21 beautiful coral22 reefs that we saw. Our day of snorkeling was followed up with a most memorable dinner, which we enjoyed at the home of a local family. As with most traditional Tao couples, the husband did the fishing for our dinner, leaving his wife to prepare the day°¶s catch of fresh lobster23, which she served with yams13 and many other dishes. °ßWe may be poor, but we eat lobster every day!°® the wife said jokingly. On a more serious note, the husband told us that they had learned to live in peace with nature and appreciate a life of simplicity. °@°@On the morning of our third and last day, we enjoyed breakfast at a stand next to the beach. Tasting fresh seaweed salad for the first time and listening to the sound of the waves nearby, we experienced this paradise in yet another peaceful way. Giving the island one final glance24 before taking off that afternoon, we said quietly to ourselves, °ßWe will definitely return to Lanyu, the last pearl in the Pacific Ocean.°® 
The Google Guys. °@°@In 1996, two graduate students at Stanford University1 had a grand1 dream. Larry Page2 and Sergey Brin3 wanted to make information available to everybody. They started a research project together and, two years later, started a company in a friend°¶s garage. Today they are billionaires2, and that company is Google4.  °@°@Google is a search engine5°Xa way of searching for information on the Internet. In 1996, there were already several search engines, but Page and Brin believed they had a better technique3 for searching the Web, so they created Google. Google comes from the word googol6, which is a 1 with 100 zeros after it. Everybody loved Google because it was fast and easy to use. More and more people began to use it, and the company grew quickly. Eventually, so many people were using Google that in 2006 the verb °ßgoogle°® was added to the dictionary. Today, more than two-thirds of computer users use Google, and the Google search engine receives about a billion search requests a day. °@°@Sergey Brin was born in Russia7 in August 1973. His family immigrated4 to the United States when he was six and settled in Maryland8. Brin became interested in computers and math when he was very young, and his parents encouraged him. His father was a mathematics professor5, and his mother worked for NASA9. In school, Brin was a star in the chess club and on the math team, but he also loved to have fun and to play jokes on people. He received a bachelor°¶s degree10 in mathematics and computer science from the University of Maryland. He then went to Stanford and earned a master°¶s degree11. From there, he entered Stanford°¶s Ph.D.12 program. The rest is history. °@°@Larry Page was born in Michigan13 in March 1973. His parents were both computer scientists. As a boy, Page idolized6 Nikola Tesla14, the inventor of the AC15 system of electricity. He says he fell in love with computers at age six. He was a brilliant boy and was often smarter than even his best teachers. Everyone knew he would do something great one day. Page got a bachelor°¶s degree in computer engineering from the University of Michigan16. He earned a master°¶s degree from Stanford before entering their Ph.D. program. When Page and Brin met, they didn°¶t like each other very much, but soon they realized that they had an interest in common°Xmaking a better search engine. °@°@Without these two °ßwonder boys,°® there would be no Google. The success of Google, however, comes mostly from its special corporate7 culture. Page and Brin didn°¶t want their company to be like other big corporations. Their motto8 was °ßDon°¶t be evil.°® They didn°¶t want the company to hurt people or the planet in any way. For example, the company uses solar9 energy. About one-third of the electricity they need is produced by solar panels10 installed11 on the roofs of the buildings. They also try to create a fun and enjoyable atmosphere at the company. The main lobby of Google°¶s headquarters12 is decorated with a piano and colorful lamps from the 1960s. The hallways13 are full of toys and sports equipment, such as exercise balls and bicycles. And all of the employees14 can use the company°¶s recreational15 facilities16. These include exercise rooms, video games, and a roller rink17. There°¶s also a pool17 table, Foosball18, Ping-Pong19, and a baby grand piano. The company even gives its employees free snacks and cereals18 as well as juices, sodas, and coffee. °@°@Page and Brin never believed in creating a strict and formal19 atmosphere. If you visited Googleplex20, you would see employees playing games and having fun. Of course, they also do work. But to promote creative thinking, all Google engineers are encouraged to spend one day a week on any project that interests them. This has actually worked out very well for the company. Engineers have created several new Google services during these periods. °@°@Google also has a tradition of playing April Fool°¶s jokes21. In 2002, they claimed that pigeons22 were the secret behind their successful search engine. In 2004, they put up Google Lunar23, which advertised jobs on the moon. In 2005, they advertised a new drink called Google Gulp24 that was supposed to improve the brain. Every year there is a clever new joke. One year, around the first of April, they brought out a new e-mail service called Gmail. Everyone thought it was a joke! °@°@The success of Google and its founders is no joke, however. Google continues to grow and has bought several smaller companies. It continues to improve on its products and services, and it has created many new ones, such as Google News, Google Earth, Google Maps, and Google Video. In 2007, Google bought the online video site YouTube25. Page and Brin are now among the richest men in the world. Nevertheless, you can still catch Page going to work on his in-line skates or snapping together a robot with his Lego26 bricks. And you can still see Brin with a mischievous look in his eyes, thinking up a clever new trick. 
°@°@A middle school teacher was having a hard time managing her class, a particularly spiteful batch of teenagers who were endlessly arguing among themselves. After several futile attempts at building team spirit, she told the students to write down the nicest thing they could say about each classmate next to his or her name on a sheet of paper. She then listed all the compliments each person had received on separate sheets. The next day, she distributed these sheets to the students. In no time, the dull morning class was transformed, for every student had a smile on his or her face. There were whispers such as °ßI didn°¶t know everyone liked me so much°® and °ßThis is the best compliment I°¶ve ever received°® going round the class. The effect was magical; it made everybody feel so touched, so loved, and so special. That morning would always hold a special place in their hearts. °@°@Can you think of a similar experience in which praise from someone made your day? Or did a compliment ever make you feel better when you were in a really low mood? Genuine compliments make a big difference in our lives: they bring a smile to our faces and brighten things up instantly. A compliment is able to encourage a friend who is demoralized*, make a child more confident, and make a patient more hopeful of a speedy recovery. Additionally, a person who frequently compliments others generally comes across as a warm person and bonds easily with peers and colleagues.  °@°@Here are a few tips on giving compliments that will help you delight the receiver and avoid any kind of awkwardness:  Compliment the person, not the object. Instead of saying °ßWhat a nice dress,°® try saying °ßThat dress looks really good on you!°® Some people cannot take compliments as they feel they are not good enough. Saying °ßYou are such an amazing singer!°® might lead them to deny the compliment because they think they do not deserve it. In such cases, try changing the compliment to reflect the positive effect those people have had on you. For instance, if you say, °ßYour voice had such a soothing effect on me; it made me feel calm and serene,°® they will not need to worry about whether they are good enough. °@°@ Follow up the compliment with a question. It ensures that the person at the receiving end will not feel awkward. For example, °ßThat°¶s such a cool watch°® can be followed by °ßIs it new?°® This way, the recipient can accept the compliment by replying to the question. °@°@ Don°¶t give unnecessary praise. The more undeserved compliments a person gets, the less likely he or she will believe them. °@°@ Be sincere and specific in your comments. °ßI love the way you°¶ve garnished* the dish with fresh basil*; it looks delicious!°® shows that you were truly paying attention. °@°@ °@°@While it is always nice to receive compliments, it isn°¶t always easy to accept compliments gracefully. We sometimes dismiss a compliment by looking away or mumbling a half-hearted °ßthank you.°® What we should do is look the person in the eye and thank him or her firmly and gracefully. But you don°¶t need to compliment him or her in return as this might appear hasty and insincere. °@°@There is no denying the power of compliments: like the Midas touch*, when adequately given and responded to, they can elicit smiles, inspire happiness, and change lives. We are all capable of spreading this magic around. Let us take a few minutes out each day and try to make at least one person smile. Let us try to create magic with our compliments and make the world a happier place! 
A Small Town With Great Charm. °@°@Tamsui, a small town situated where the Tamsui River flows peacefully into the ocean, just across the river from Mount Guanyin, is one of Taiwan°¶s unique cultural treasures. Like Venice and many other towns and cities with rivers running through them, Tamsui is picturesque and has a cozy atmosphere. Visitors enjoy the views and the tranquil breeze near the river. In addition to its lovely scenery, Tamsui contains many significant historical sites because of its long colonial and multicultural past. Hence, a visit to this attractive little town not only provides a chance to escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life, but also allows one°¶s imagination to wander back in time. °@°@The name Tamsui derives from the Tamsui River, yet in the early years the town was called °ßHuwei°® by the locals, meaning °ßthe end of the fish traps.°® In fact, centuries ago there were quite a few fish traps, made by piling stones along the northern coast of Taiwan. With the rise and fall of the tides, fish would end up in the traps. Through this primitive fishing method, people in the area lived a self-sufficient life. Not until Westerners arrived in the sixteenth century did the local way of life change. Due to its advantageous geographical location, this small fishing village became a much-desired port, which was occupied and ruled by the Spanish and later the Dutch. Finally, Taiwanese rule was restored in 1661 by an eminent general, Cheng Cheng-Kung. Then, starting in the 1870s, the town was modernized as a consequence of the arrival of a Canadian missionary, Dr. George Leslie Mackay. Before long, Tamsui had become an international port, but the gradual accumulation of sand and dirt in the river caused it to revert to a small fishing town. Nowadays, with the expansion of Taipei City, this old port has regained its fame as one of the major tourist attractions in northern Taiwan. °@°@No trip to Tamsui is complete without a stroll through its historical sites, many of which bear witness to the influence of a multicultural, colonial past and boast a unique blend of Western and Eastern styles. One of the most distinctive examples of this is the renowned Fort San Domingo, or Hong-Mao Cheng. Following its Chinesestyle main entrance, a garden path leads visitors to the main fort building, a square tower with an outer wall of red bricks, while just to the east of the fort lies the Former British Consulate, a fine Victorian-style brick building. Another example from Tamsui°¶s colonial past is the Tamsui Oxford Museum. Originally called Oxford College, it was founded by Dr. Mackay. The building°¶s red bricks and tile roof display a traditional Chinese style, while the dormer windows and arched shades are Western in design. Interestingly enough, on the roof are pagodas and a cross standing side by side in perfect harmony. °@°@After a nostalgic exploration of Tamsui°¶s historical sites, visitors can jump back into the present to enjoy this small Taiwanese town as it is today. Awaiting them are alluring scenic spots along the water as well as a tempting feast of local specialties. But dusk is the time when Tamsui really comes alive. The Tamsui Old Street and waterfront boardwalk are always loaded with food stands selling crispy fish sticks, giant ice-cream cones, iron eggs, and A-Gei. Along the narrow alleys are many little shops as well, where cheap clothes, handicrafts, and souvenirs can be found. Visitors can also take a short ferry ride across the river to Bali or along the coast to Fisherman°¶s Wharf. Both piers offer grand boardwalks, along which people of all ages can walk or ride bikes, savor the splendid sights, relax, and sample fresh seafood or sip hot coffee. These two places are favorites with couples and lovers, who stroll arm in arm admiring the sunset before having a romantic dinner. °@°@Visiting Tamsui is like taking a brief look at the four-hundredyear history of Taiwan. Not only can visitors get a sense of what the town was like in past centuries, but they will also be able to appreciate the importance of maintaining its historical treasures. Wandering around Tamsui, visitors will see that the town has evolved and developed, while still keeping much of its rich history, multicultural spirit, and ageless natural beauty. 
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄBorn in Nanjing2 in 1928, Yu Kwang-chung3 is one of the most influential1 poets and writers in Taiwanese contemporary2 literature. When he  was 10, Japan invaded3 China and he had to flee4 his home with  his family. In 1947, he again fled to Hong Kong4 because of the Communists5‚Äô advance5 in the civil war6. Finally, he settled in Taiwan. With these early experiences, he once described Mainland China7 as mother, Taiwan as wife, and Hong Kong as a friend. „ÄÄ„ÄÄProfessor Yu is a writer of great influence1, especially resourceful6 in poetry and prose7.

Ôªø Dear Teacher, I would like to introduce my son Wind-Wolf1. He is probably what you would consider a typical Indian kid. He was born and raised on the reservation. He has black hair, dark brown eyes, and an olive3 complexion4. Like so many Indian children his age, he is shy and quiet in the classroom. He is five years old, in kindergarten, and I can‚Äôt understand why you have already labeled him a ‚Äúslow learner.‚Äù   At the age of five, he has already been through quite an education compared with his peers5 in Western society. He has been with his mother when she gathered herbs6 for healing. He has sat with his uncles in a rowboat7 on the river while they fished with gillnets2. He has had many opportunities to watch his ceremonial8 leaders use different kinds of colorful feathers preparing for the sacred dances and rituals. And he also listened to the elders9 as they told creation stories and animal legends10 and sang songs around the campfires3. It takes a long time to understand and reflect on these kinds of experiences, so maybe that is why you think my Indian child is a slow learner. He is not culturally ‚Äúdisadvantaged11,‚Äù but he is culturally different. If you ask him how many months there are in a year, he will probably tell you 13. He will respond this way because he has been taught by our traditional people. He knows that some eagles12 may have 12 tail feathers or 7. He can probably count more than 40 different kinds of birds. He may have trouble writing his name on a piece of paper, but he knows how to say it and many other things in different Indian languages. He is not fluent13 yet because he is only 5 years old and required14 by law to attend15 your educational system, learn your language, your values, your way of thinking, and your methods of teaching and learning. Wind-Wolf was not prepared for his first tentative16 step into your world; neither were you appreciative17 of his culture. On the first day of class, you had difficulty with his name. You wanted to call him Wind, insisting18 that somehow Wolf must be his middle name. While you are trying to teach him your new methods, he may be looking out the window as if day-dreaming4. Why? Because he has been taught to watch and study the changes in nature. In his young mind, and almost by instinct, he knows that this is the time of year he is supposed to be with his people gathering and preparing fish, deer19 meat, and native plants and herbs, and learning his assigned20 tasks in this role. He is caught between worlds, torn by different cultural systems. So dear teacher, I want to introduce you my son Wind-Wolf, who is not really a ‚Äútypical‚Äù kid after all. What you say and what you do in the classroom, what you teach and how you teach it, and what you say and what you don‚Äôt say will have a significant21 effect on the potential22 failure or success of my child. Please remember that this is the primary year of his education and development. All I ask is that you work with me, not against me, to help educate my child in the best way. My son Wind-Wolf is not an empty23 glass coming into your class to be filled. He is a full basket coming into a different environment and society with something special to share. Please let him share his knowledge, heritage, and culture with you and his peers. Sincerely, Robert Lake 
Ôªø „ÄÄ„ÄÄAccording to her official biography1, she was born in London on November 1, 1974, but she is still in the third grade and remains a classic Japanese icon2. She likes to have tea parties and make friends all over the world. She weighs the same as three apples, has a twin3 sister named Mimmy2, who wears her hair ribbon on the right side instead of the left, loves to play in the forest, practices the piano and bakes4, and she has no mouth. Hello, Kitty3! „ÄÄ„ÄÄ Hello Kitty is the best-known symbol of Japanese kawaii4, or cuteness. Since the 1970s, kawaii has become a prominent aspect of Japanese popular culture, entertainment5, clothing, food, toys, personal appearance, and behavior. The everyday landscape6 of Tokyo5‚îÄthe advertisements on the subway7, store signs, digital8 display screens, and various forms of mass media9 like manga6 (Japanese comics) and fashion magazines‚îÄis filled with cute stuff10. As a cultural phenomenon11, cuteness is increasingly accepted in Japan as a part of Japanese culture and national identity12. Nobuyoshi Kurita7, professor at Musashi University8 in Tokyo, has stated that kawaii is a ‚Äúmagic term‚Äù that includes everything that is acceptable and desirable in Japan.    „ÄÄ„ÄÄAlmost any cute cartoon character is an excellent sell in Japan. Many different types of companies, big and small, have licensed13 characters like Kitty or imports such as Snoopy9 and Miffy10 to jazz up their advertising. For example, Pikachu11, a character from Pok√©mon, adorns14 the side of three All Nippon Airways12 passenger planes. Spend five minutes in shopping centers like Shibuya13 and Shinjuku14, and you almost feel as if you were in a cartoon town.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ Cuteness sells big in Japan. Take Hello Kitty for example. The simple image of the white cat with the big head has  been put on 20,000 products from book  bags and card-holders15 to toasters16 and  vacuums17. There is even a Hello Kitty  amusement park near Tokyo. Hello  Kitty alone generates about half  of Tokyo-based Sanrio15‚Äôs US$1  billion profit every year. „ÄÄ„ÄÄKawaii not only sells in Japan.  Cute merchandise18 and products are  especially popular in other parts of East  Asia as well, such as China, Hong Kong,  Taiwan, and South Korea16. Kids from South  Korea have become Japan-crazy, starting with fashion and music. Hong Kongers and Taiwanese find Japanese culture more attractive than that from the west. The kawaii, but otherwise untalented, teen idols19 produced by the Japanese pop20 industry can be easily seen in karaoke17 bars all over Asia. „ÄÄ„ÄÄHowever, some people think kawaii is not just a marketing21 gimmick18. It is deeply rooted in Japanese culture and manifests22 itself in social and gender roles, particularly those of young Japanese women. Cuteness isn‚Äôt just a fashion statement‚îÄpink lipstick23, butterfly hair bands, and fluffy19 bags‚îÄit is  also a type of behavior. Cute girls often pout20, act silly, speak in childish21 voices, and stamp24 their feet when they are angry. Even boys are getting into the cute look. The latest trend25: Japanese boys are shaving26 their legs for the summer, short-pants22 season. „ÄÄ„ÄÄSome Japanese feminists charge that all this cute style is really about the cultural domination27 and exploitation of women in the country. It encourages girls and young women well into their late twenties to act obedient, weak, and innocent rather than mature28, confident, and independent.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ Is kawaii so uncute? „ÄÄ„ÄÄKazuhiko Sato23, the chief29 editor of Cawaii24 magazine, which has a circulation of about 300,000 and a target30 audience of 15 to 19-year-olds or so, thinks the power of cuteness will be around in Japan for a very long time, and he does not think there is anything unhealthy or negative about any of this. When asked if the power of cuteness and Hello Kitty are turning Japanese girls into obedient little bunnies25, Sato said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think girls are acting in an obedient way at all. They‚Äôre trying to be cute to get more attention from the boys.‚Äù  „ÄÄ„ÄÄAfter all, cuteness conquers all. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄThis is the text2 of a commencement1 address by Steve Jobs2, former CEO of Apple Computer and of Pixar3 Animation Studios, delivered at Stanford University4 on June 12, 2005.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄI am honored to be with you today. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That‚Äôs it. No big deal. Just three stories. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe first story is about connecting the dots3.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄI dropped out of Reed College5 after the first six months, but then stayed around as a drop-in6 for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?  „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen I was 17, I naively4 chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class7 parents‚Äô money was being spent on my college tuition5. I couldn‚Äôt see the value in it. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back, I think it was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIt wasn‚Äôt all romantic. But much of what I found by accident with my curiosity6 and intuition7 turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example:  „ÄÄ„ÄÄReed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy8 instruction around. Because I had dropped out, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to create beautiful and artistic handwriting. I learned about varying8 the amount of space between different letter combinations and what makes letters in text look great.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ But it seemed as though none of this had even a hope  of any practical application in my life. But ten years later,  when we were designing the first Macintosh9 computer, we  designed it all into the Mac10. If I had never dropped out,  I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class,  and the Mac would have never had many typefaces11,  and personal computers might not be able to create  the wonderful fonts12 that they do today. Of course  it was impossible to connect the dots looking  forward when I was in college. But it was very,  very clear looking back ten years later. „ÄÄMy second story is about love and loss. „ÄÄ„ÄÄWoz13 and I started Apple in my parent‚Äôs garage when I was 20. In ten years, Apple had grown into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees. But just as I turned thirty, I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as our visions9 of the future began to diverge10, our Board of Directors14 eventually sided with the others. So at 30 I was out, very publicly11 out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone. I had been rejected12, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ I didn‚Äôt see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness13 of being successful was replaced by the lightness14 of being a beginner again. It freed me to enter one of the most creative hours of my life.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄDuring the next five years, I started a company named NeXT15, and another company Pixar. Pixar went on to create the world‚Äôs first computer animated film, ‚ÄúToy Story,‚Äù and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In an amazing turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, and I returned to Apple.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄSometimes life hits you in the head with a brick15. Don‚Äôt lose faith. I‚Äôm totally sure that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You‚Äôve got to find what you love. If you haven‚Äôt found it yet, keep looking. Don‚Äôt settle.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄMy third story is about death.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen I was 17, I read this: ‚ÄúIf you live each day as if it were your last, someday you‚Äôll most certainly be right.‚Äù It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‚ÄúIf today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?‚Äù   „ÄÄ„ÄÄRemembering that I‚Äôll be dead soon is the most important tool I‚Äôve known to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything‚îÄall expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure‚îÄthese things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked16. There is no reason not to follow your heart. „ÄÄ„ÄÄAbout a year ago, one morning, I was diagnosed with cancer. The doctors told me it was almost certainly a deadly type of cancer, and advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which  is doctor‚Äôs code for preparing to die. I lived with  that diagnosis all day. Later that evening, when  the doctors viewed the cells under  a microscope17, they started crying  because it turned out to be a  very rare form of cancer  that is curable18 with  surgery19. I had the  surgery and I‚Äôm  fine now.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThis was the closest I‚Äôve been to facing death. „ÄÄ„ÄÄNo one wants to die. Yet death is the destination20 we all share. No one has ever escaped it. It is life‚Äôs change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄYour time is limited, so don‚Äôt waste it living someone else‚Äôs life. Don‚Äôt be trapped by others‚Äô beliefs, which is living with the results of other people‚Äôs thinking. Don‚Äôt let the noise of others‚Äô opinions drown21 out your own inner22 voice, and most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. „ÄÄ ‚ÄúStay hungry, stay foolish.‚Äù That‚Äôs what I have always wished for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew16, I wish that for you. „ÄÄ„ÄÄStay hungry. Stay foolish. 	
Unit 2  The Fourth Tuesday°XWe Talk About Death. 	°ßPeople know they°¶re going to die,°® Morrie said, °ßbut nobody believes it. If only we did, we would do things differently.°® 	°ßSo we kid ourselves about death,°® I said. 	°ßYes, but there°¶s a better approach: to know you°¶re going to die, and to be prepared for it at any time. That°¶s better. That way, you can actually be more involved in your life while you°¶re living.°® 	°ßHow can you ever be prepared to die?°® I asked. 	°ßDo what the Buddhists do. Every day, have a little bird on your shoulder that asks, °•Is today the day? Am I ready? Am I doing all I need to do? Am I being the person I want to be?°¶°® 	He turned his head to his shoulder as if the bird were there now. °ßIs today the day I die?°® he asked. 	°ßThe truth is, Mitch,°® he said, °ßonce you learn how to die, you learn how to live.°® 	I nodded. 	°ßI°¶m going to say it again,°® he said. °ßOnce you learn how to die, you learn how to live.°® He was making sure I absorbed this point, without embarrassing me by asking if I had really got it. It was part of what made him a good teacher. 	°ßDid you think much about death before you got sick?°® I asked. 	°ßNo,°® Morrie smiled. °ßI was like everyone else. I once told a friend of mine, in a moment of exuberance, °•I°¶m gonna be the healthiest old man you°¶ve ever met!°¶ °® 	°ßHow old were you?°® I asked. 	°ßIn my sixties,°® Morrie smiled again. 	°ßSo you were optimistic,°® I said. 	°ßWhy not?°® Morrie replied. °ßLike I said, people don°¶t really believe they°¶re going to die.°® 	°ßBut everyone knows someone who has died,°® I said. °ßWhy is it so hard to think about dying?°® 	°ßBecause,°® Morrie continued, °ßmost of us all walk around as if we°¶re sleepwalking. We really don°¶t experience the world fully, because we°¶re half asleep, automatically doing the things we think we have to do.°® 	°ßAnd facing death changes all that?°® I asked. 	°ßOh, yes. You strip away all that stuff and you focus on the essentials,°® he said. °ßWhen you realize you are going to die, you see everything much differently.°® He sighed. °ßLearn how to die, and you learn how to live.°® 	I noticed that he quivered now when he moved his hands. His glasses hung around his neck, and when he lifted them to his eyes, they slid around his temples as if he were trying to put them on someone else in the dark. I reached over to help guide them onto his ears. 	°ßThank you,°® Morrie whispered. He smiled when my hand brushed up against his head. The slightest human contact was immediate joy. °ßMitch,°® he said. °ßCan I tell you something?°® 	°ßOf course,°® I replied. 	°ßYou might not like it,°® he cautioned. 	°ßWhy not?°® I asked. 	°ßWell, the truth is,°® he began, °ßif only you really listened to that bird on your shoulder and accepted that you could die at any time, then you might not be as ambitious as you are.°® 	I forced a small grin. 	°ßThe things you spend so much time on°Xall this work you do°Xmight not seem as important,°® he continued. °ßYou might have to make room for some more spiritual things.°® 	°ßSpiritual things?°® I asked. 	°ßYou hate that word, don°¶t you?°® Morrie said. °ß °•Spiritual.°¶ You think it°¶s touchy-feely stuff.°® 	°ßWell,°® I said. 	He tried to wink, a bad try, and I burst into laughter. 	°ßMitch,°® he said, laughing along, °ßeven I don°¶t know what °•spiritual development°¶ really means. But I do know we°¶re deficient in some way. We are too involved in materialistic things, and they don°¶t satisfy us. The loving relationships we have, the universe around us, we take these things for granted.°® 	He nodded toward the window with the sunshine streaming in. °ßYou see that? You can go out there, outside, anytime. You can run up and down the block and go crazy. I can°¶t do that. I can°¶t go out. I can°¶t run. I can°¶t be out there without fear of getting sick. But you know what? I appreciate that window more than you do.°® 	°ßAppreciate it?°® I asked. 	°ßYes,°® Morrie said. °ßI look out that window every day. I notice the change in the trees and how strong the wind is blowing. It°¶s like I can see time passing through that windowpane. Because I know my time is almost done, I am drawn to nature like I°¶m seeing it for the first time.°® 	He stopped, and for a moment we both looked out the window. I tried to see what he saw. I tried to see time and seasons, and my life passed in slow motion. Morrie dropped his head slightly and curled it toward his shoulder. 	°ßIs it today, little bird?°® he asked. °ßIs it today?°® °XAdapted from tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom. 
Unit 4  Butterflies and Elephants. 	Seven hundred faces stared at me. Some people were giggling, while others were quietly attentive. Wearing my white polka-dot dress, I stood onstage. I was one of the six girls in my senior class who had been voted to be a °ßprincess°® to represent our high school in a huge, citywide festival. When I was selected, I knew that I°¶d eventually have to give a speech. Despite my considerable anxiety, I decided to take on this challenge and conquer my fear of public speaking. 	Little did the audience know that as I stood there looking °ßall together,°® my heart was actually beating like a drum. Then, I decided that this must not be true at all. Of course they could hear the hammering of my heart. °ßDear God, what am I doing?°® I said to myself. No butterflies remained in my stomach. No, now I had elephants. The thundering herd was threatening to trample me thoroughly. Nervousness filled my veins, making me feel dizzy. 	I stepped toward the microphone. Aware of all the heads bobbing in the sea of faces before me, I began my speech. A few phrases tumbling out quickly, the tremor in my voice was noticeable. However, a growing sense of confidence began to build inside of me as the crowd quieted down. My muscles relaxed. My breathing eased. Maybe the weeks of practicing before my bedroom mirror were paying off. °ßMaybe I can really do this,°® I thought to myself. 	Then, just thirty seconds into my three-minute speech, the microphone died. Glaring at the offending instrument of my potential downfall, I wondered if it might be possible to strangle an inanimate object! How could the microphone do this to me? 	Outwardly paralyzed with horror and humiliation, I frantically plotted what I should do next. Should I run off the stage in despair or wait for the power to return to the microphone? Time seemed to stand still, crystallizing a moment of opportunity°Xwhen intent suddenly meant everything. 	I chose neither of my first two quick solutions. Instead, I faced this unexpected obstacle directly: I closed my eyes to still my quaking limbs and forced out the hot anxiety in my lungs to make room for what I intended to do. 	I took a deep breath, paused for a moment, and then continued. Before me, the hushed audience focused on each new word, as if I were a bird, singing out for the very first time. Knowing that I had made the right decision, I felt the blood return to my pale face, along with a calm, sure feeling. Next, my voice boomed out. It reached far into the recesses of the upper balcony, where I could see people no longer bobbing in front of me, but sitting fascinated, and maybe amazed at how determined I was. 	My soliloquy ended. Then, all of the students shouted and cheered, the large room vibrating with applause. I appeared humble on the outside, yet I was bursting with pride on the inside. I had mastered my greatest fear, along with a big extra dose of unforeseen adversity. I had driven the butterflies and elephants out of my stomach. At that moment, I honestly believed that this loud cheering was a new kind of elephant thundering in my ears! 	In an instant, a realization swept over me like a gift°XI could do anything! Taking a bow in my white polka-dot dress, I felt a glow that I would never forget. I realized that inside of me existed a young woman once tested°Xa young woman who was bolder than her fear. °XBy Lisa Robertson, from Chocolate for a Teen°¶s Soul
°@°@When you hear about plastic surgery, what do you think of?  A Hollywood1 star trying to delay the effects of aging?  People who want to change the size of their stomachs?  But what about the four-year-old boy who has his chin2 rebuilt3 after a dog bite?  °@°@The word °ßplastic°® is taken from a Greek word, which means to form or mold4.  However, it doesn°¶t mean that patients who have this type of surgery end up with a face full of fake5 stuff.  Plastic surgery can be divided into reconstructive6 procedures7 and cosmetic ones. °@°@Reconstructive procedures correct defects8 on the face or body.  These include physical birth defects like cleft9 lips, injuries like those from dog bites or burns, or the consequences10 of disease treatments like rebuilding a woman°¶s breast11 after surgery for breast cancer.  °@°@ Cosmetic procedures alter12 a part of the body that the person is not satisfied with.  Common cosmetic procedures include making breasts larger or smaller, reshaping13 the nose, and removing14 pockets of fat from specific spots on the body. °@°@ Although we don°¶t normally15 think of young people as candidates16 for cosmetic surgery, the number of teens who choose to get plastic surgery is on the rise.  Teens who have cosmetic procedures, such as those that can help smooth17 or cover severe18 acne19 scars20, sometimes feel more comfortable with their appearances after the procedure.  Reconstructive surgery helps teens repair significant defects or problems, but what about having cosmetic surgery just to change their appearances?  As with everything, there are right and wrong reasons to have surgery. °@°@Cosmetic surgery is unlikely21 to change their life.  Most licensed and respected plastic surgeons22 spend a lot of time interviewing teens who want plastic surgery to decide whether or not they are good candidates for the surgery.  Doctors want to make sure that teens are emotionally23 mature enough to handle the surgery and that they are doing it for the right reasons.  °@°@Some doctors won°¶t perform certain procedures on a teenager until they are sure that the person is old enough and has finished growing.  Girls who want to enlarge24 their breasts for cosmetic reasons usually must be at least 18 because such surgery is only approved25 for women 18 and older.  °@°@ Almost all teens are self-conscious about their bodies.  Some wish there were a thing or two that could be changed.  A lot of this self-consciousness2 goes away with time.  Before getting any plastic surgery, ask yourself if you want it for yourself or to please someone else.  Appropriate weight control and exercise can do great things for a person°¶s looks without surgery.  It is never a good idea to choose plastic surgery as a first option26. °@°@Some people°¶s emotions have a really big effect on how they think they look.  People who are depressed,  extremely self-critical27, or have an incorrect view of how they really look sometimes think that changing their looks will solve their problems.  In these cases, it won°¶t.  In fact, many doctors won°¶t perform plastic surgery on teens who suffer from depression or other emotional problems until these problems are treated first.  °@°@If you are considering plastic surgery, talk it over with your parents.  If you are serious and your parents agree, the next step is meeting with a plastic surgeon to help you learn what to expect before, during, and after the procedure¢was well as any possible complications28 of the surgery.  Procedures and healing times vary, so you will want to do your research into what°¶s involved in your particular procedure.  It is a good idea to choose a doctor who is approved by a professional organization of plastic surgeons.  °@°@Plastic surgery is not something to rush into.  If you are thinking about it, find out as much as you can about the specific procedure you are considering and talk it over with doctors and your parents.  Once you have the facts, you can decide whether the surgery is right for you. 
°@°@As members of the global village, we have to face this very serious issue: environmental protection. The following are f?ive things that we need to do today. °@°@Even the cleanest countries have serious environmental problems. Finland1 wins high marks for air and water quality, a low incidence1 of infant disease, and the measures it takes to protect its citizens from water pollution and natural disasters. But the country also produces an above-average amount of greenhouse gases, uses a massive2 amount of land and water to sustain3 the national level of consumption, and contributes signif?icantly to regional environmental problems.  °@°@To get greener, countries must do more to take advantage of national strengths. Finland, among the world°¶s largest exporters4 of wind-power technology, produces less than 1 percent of its own electricity through wind power. It is about time that Finland made better use of its wind-power technology for the country°¶s electricity supply5.  °@°@On June 22, 1969, the Cuyahoga River2 in Cleveland3, Ohio4, caught fire. No one was hurt, and the f?ire caused only about $50,000 worth of property9 damage. Still, polluted water in the river had a huge impact7, focusing attention on environmental issues in the United States. Three years later, the Clean Water Act5 was enacted8, and in time, other aggressive9 steps were taken to improve the quality of the country°¶s air and water. Today, people fish and canoe10 on big stretches11 of the Cuyahoga. °@°@To fight air pollution, the U.S. Congress boosted12 the average fuel economy standard for passenger cars from 18 mpg6 to 27.5 mpg between 1978 and 1985. It hasn°¶t risen since. That°¶s likely to change, but Congress should do more to improve energy eff?iciency, such as offering greater incentives7 to own alternative13-fuel vehicles14. °@°@In developed nations, people tend to live in cities and suburbs15, concentrating pollution in those areas. When rural16 swaths8 are publicly owned and protected against development, they become °ßgreen moats9°® that stop the harmful effects of °ßbrown cities.°® Canada exemplif?ies17 this. While wild forests are largely disappearing in most developed nations, they still thrive18 in Canada. Their presence helps explain why the country rates well overall19 for clean water and air, despite having a densely20 populated21 southern22 tier10 where cities like Montreal11 contribute to sulfur12 dioxide emissions that are nearly double the average in similar countries. °@°@Other countries should follow Canada°¶s lead and preserve23 their unspoiled wilderness13. Doing so will help make up for the harmful effects of urban24 pollution. °@°@It°¶s a fact that people living in affluent14 countries tend to be better educated, enjoy a higher standard of living, live longer lives, and have a brighter future. Unfortunately, their material wealth results in a larger carbon footprint. Happily, their affluence14 and education makes people who live in these countries more likely to be aware and active when it comes to doing something about that footprint.  °@°@It is in the interest of all countries for each one of them to gear26 public policy toward developing an informed citizenry16. The goal should be an engaged, educated public that can act as a powerful solution to environmental destruction27. °@°@How great is the potential environmental impact of China on the rest of the world? Consider: If its car-ownership28 rate matched that of the United States, one billion cars would be on China°¶s roads. That would mean total gas consumption of 520 billion gallons per year¢wnearly half the current world use. Fortunately, there are signs the Chinese government is taking environmental problems seriously. China has announced29 a number of ambitious30 green goals, including cutting the use of coal in half, eliminating 200 manufacturing plants in the Beijing17 suburbs and lowering sulfur levels in gasoline. °@°@Global environmental management requires global cooperation. That means Western nations need to move more quickly in sharing with China emerging technologies that can be used to develop clean, alternative energy.
