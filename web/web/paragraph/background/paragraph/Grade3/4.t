Lin Hwai-min and the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre. ¡@¡@When Time magazine selected Lin Hwai-min1 as one of its 2005 ¡§heroes of Asia,¡¨ his countrypeople1 in Taiwan felt proud. But they were not surprised. In their minds, Lin clearly deserved the title. Over the past three decades, he has proved himself again and again as a choreographer2 of great ambition2, courage, and genius. ¡@¡@Lin¡¦s ambition of setting up a dance company started in the early 1970s. It must have been like a wild dream at the time. He was only twenty-six years old. There were few people in Taiwan then who knew anything about modern dance, and there were few studios or theaters to practice or perform in. But Lin refused to give up his dream. He borrowed money and began gathering and training dancers, practicing with them wherever he could. When they finally began performing, in 1973, they also presented their dances wherever they could, in big cities and in small towns, in formal theaters and in high school auditoriums3. No matter where they appeared, Lin¡¦s dancers were greeted by enthusiastic audiences all over the island. ¡@¡@From these humble but promising4 beginnings, Lin built the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre3 into the most famous and influential5 performing group in Taiwan. Today, the company has its own spacious6 studio in suburban7 Taipei and an extensive performance schedule that includes shows at the most famous theaters around the world. Locally, Cloud Gate¡¦s performances are often sold out, and outdoor performances such as those held at the CKS Memorial Park4 in Taipei attract tens of thousands of fans. Abroad, the company has often been praised as the most outstanding8 dance company in Asia. Clearly, Lin¡¦s dream has turned into a source of pride not only for himself and his dancers, but also for the people of Taiwan. ¡@¡@What makes Cloud Gate so praiseworthy9 is Lin¡¦s unique style of choreography, especially his great talent for fusing10 East and West. This fusion is evident11 in the movements he uses in his dances as well as the images and the themes12. He uses modern dance and ballet5 movements, for example, but combines13 these with movements inspired by a wide range of Asian traditions: Chinese opera6, tai-chi7 and chi-kong8, Buddhist9 meditation14, aboriginal15 ritual16 dances, the classical dances of Indonesia, India, Korea, and Japan, and also everyday motions17 that are familiar to Asian peoples, for example, the motions of people planting rice or burning incense10. Lin himself has described his dances as ¡§a mixture of many, many things.¡¨ ¡@¡@The images seen in Lin¡¦s dances are also an original mixture of many things. Once again, the Chinese and Asian-inspired images are especially striking18. In one dance, for example, the back of the stage is covered with a giant lotus painting; in another, huge calligraphy19 scrolls20 hang from the ceiling; and in still another, rice grains are poured onto the stage in a continuous stream, resembling a sort of unusual but beautiful waterfall. While images such as these reflect a traditional Chinese sensibility21, other images focus on a more modern-day experience. Certainly, Lin¡¦s dances are full of tremendous diversity22. It¡¦s no wonder that Time magazine has described him as ¡§Asia¡¦s synthesizing11 dance genius.¡¨ ¡@¡@The same is true of Lin Hwai-min¡¦s themes¡Xthat is, the stories and ideas that he expresses in his dances. He often deals with local or Asian themes, but always infuses23 them with a universal dimension24. For example, his most famous piece, Legacy12, first performed in 1978, tells the story of the first Chinese settlers in Taiwan, and the hardships25 and struggles they encountered when they sailed here three hundred years ago from China. But the dance also clearly reminds audiences of the pioneer stories that are part of many cultures. Lin¡¦s other dances have drawn on Chinese literature and philosophy, such as The Dream of the Red Chamber13 and Songs of the Wanderers14. These dances show Lin¡¦s reflections on Buddhist philosophy, but they also express the desire that people everywhere have to fulfill their spiritual needs and to find peace and serenity26 in today¡¦s chaotic27 world. As Lin has said, his dances explore ¡§the landscape of the human heart.¡¨ And in so doing, he is always able to create unforgettable28 experiences for audiences everywhere. 
Stay-at-Home Economy Changing Our World.      A couple of years ago, a new word entered the English language: ¡§staycation1.¡¨ Simply put, a staycation is a vacation that is spent at home. Europeans and North Americans are used to going away somewhere for their vacations. The main reason for not doing so is probably financial. When the global economy is struggling through a recession2, fewer people have the spare1 cash to spend on travel, so they opt2 for a staycation instead. However, avoiding travel during vacations is also part of a wider trend3 towards doing more activities at home, and it isn¡¦t necessarily a lack of money that is the cause. Analysts have identified a whole new sector3 known as the ¡§stay-at-home economy.¡¨      This phrase describes different types of commercial activities that take place in the home. Online shopping is an obvious4 one, but playing computer games, renting movies, and ordering food deliveries are all common examples of the stay-at-home economy in action. All of these are areas that have undergone massive expansion5 in the past several years, and they are all part of a trend that is likely to continue. It has been predicted, for example, that the number of online shoppers will double over the next five years as people look for ways to save time amid6 their busy schedules. Also, a recent study found that almost 20 percent of Internet users already shop online at least once a month.       The main driving force4 behind the growth of the stay-at-home economy is undoubtedly7 new technology. Most of us are aware of the convenience of shopping online, though we may not always pay enough attention to the dangers. A few mouse clicks can get you the products you want with a fraction5 of the time and effort that a trip to a store would take. And who needs to go all the way to a movie theater when you can order a  DVD on your computer, or have fun playing the latest online games, with their realistic graphics6 and sophisticated scenarios7?       Most experts predict that the stay-at-home economy will continue to expand. In the future, we can anticipate8 even more changes to the traditional ways we work, spend our money and leisure time, and even receive an education. What we can¡¦t be sure about is how this trend will affect social interaction. Are people going to become more and more alienated9 from one another? Or will the communication revolution continue to help us cross boundaries10 and bring us closer together? Only time will tell. 
The Wallet. ¡@¡@As I walked home one freezing day, I stumbled1 on a wallet2 someone had lost in the street. I picked it up and looked inside to find some identification so I could call the owner. But the wallet contained only three dollars and a crumpled3 letter that looked as if it had been in there for years. ¡@¡@The envelope4 was worn and the only thing that was legible5 on it was the return address. I started to open the letter, hoping to find some clue6. Then I saw the dateline7¡X1924. The letter had been written almost sixty years earlier. ¡@¡@It was written in a beautiful feminine8 handwriting9, on powder-blue1 stationery10 with a little flower in the left-hand corner. It was a Dear John letter2 that told the recipient, whose name appeared to be Michael, that the writer could not see him anymore because her mother had forbidden11 it. Even so, she wrote that she would always love him. It was signed Hannah. ¡@¡@It was a beautiful letter, but there was no way, except for the name Michael, to identify the owner. Maybe if I called information, the operator could find a phone listing for the address on the envelope.    ¡§Operator,¡¨ I began, ¡§this is an unusual request12. I¡¦m trying to find the owner of a wallet that I found. Is there any way you can tell me if there is a phone number for an address that was on an envelope in the wallet?¡¨ ¡@¡@She suggested I speak with her supervisor13, who hesitated14 for a moment, then said, ¡§Well, there is a phone listing at that address, but I can¡¦t give you the number.¡¨ She said as a courtesy15, she would call that number, explain my story and ask whoever answered if the person wanted her to connect me. I waited a few minutes and then the supervisor was back on the line. ¡§I have a party16 who will speak with you.¡¨ ¡@¡@I asked the woman on the other end of the line if she knew anyone by the name of Hannah. She gasped17. ¡§Oh! We bought this house from a family who had a daughter named Hannah. But that was thirty years ago!¡¨    ¡§Would you know where that family could be located now?¡¨ I asked.    ¡§I remember that Hannah had to place her mother in a nursing18 home3 some years ago,¡¨ the woman said. ¡§Maybe if you got in touch with them, they might be able to track down the daughter.¡¨ ¡@¡@She gave me the name of the nursing home, and I called the number. The woman on the phone told me the old lady had passed away some years ago, but the nursing home did have a phone number for where the daughter might be living. ¡@¡@I thanked the person at the nursing home and phoned the number she gave me. The woman who answered explained that Hannah herself was living in a nursing home. ¡@¡@This whole thing is stupid, I thought to myself. Why am I making such a big deal over finding the owner of a wallet that has only three dollars and a letter that is almost sixty years old? ¡@¡@Nevertheless, I called the nursing home in which Hannah was supposed to be living, and the man who answered the phone told me, ¡§Yes, Hannah is staying with us.¡¨ ¡@¡@Even though it was already 10 p.m., I asked if I could come by to see her, ¡§Well,¡¨ he said hesitatingly, ¡§if you want to take a chance, she might be in the day room watching television.¡¨ ¡@¡@I thanked him and drove over to the nursing home. The night nurse and a guard19 greeted me at the door. We went up to the third floor of the large building. In the day room, the nurse introduced me to Hannah. She was a sweet, silver-haired old-timer4 with a warm smile and a twinkle20 in her eye. ¡@¡@I told her about finding the wallet and showed her the letter. The second she saw the powder-blue envelope with that little flower on the left, she took a deep breath and said, ¡§Young man, this letter was the last contact I ever had with Michael.¡¨ ¡@¡@She looked away for a moment, deep in thought, and then said softly, ¡§I loved him very much. But I was only sixteen at the time and my mother felt I was too young. Oh, he was so handsome. He looked like Sean Connery5, the actor.¡¨    ¡§Yes,¡¨ she continued. ¡§Michael Goldstein6 was a wonderful person. If you should find him, tell him I think of him often. And,¡¨ she hesitated for a moment, almost biting her lip, ¡§tell him I still love him. You know,¡¨ she said, smiling as tears21 welled22 up in her eyes, ¡§I never did marry. I guess no one ever matched23 up to Michael ....¡¨ ¡@¡@I thanked Hannah and said good-bye. I took the elevator to the first floor and as I stood by the door, the guard there asked, ¡§Was the old lady able to help you?¡¨ ¡@¡@I told him she had given me a lead. ¡§At least I have a last name. But I think I¡¦ll let it go for a while. I spent almost the whole day trying to find the owner of this wallet.¡¨ ¡@¡@I had taken out the wallet, which was a simple brown leather24 case with red lacing7 on the side. When the guard saw it, he said,¡§Hey, wait a minute! That¡¦s Mr. Goldstein¡¦s wallet. I¡¦d know it anywhere with that bright red lacing. He¡¦s always losing that wallet. I must have found it in the halls at least three times.¡¨ ¡@¡@¡§Who¡¦s Mr. Goldstein?¡¨ I asked, as my hand began to shake. ¡@¡@¡§He¡¦s one of the old-timers on the eighth floor. That¡¦s Mike Goldstein¡¦s wallet for sure. He must have lost it on one of his walks.¡¨ ¡@¡@I thanked the guard and quickly ran back to the nurse¡¦s office. I told her what the guard had said. We went back to the elevator and got in. I prayed that Mr. Goldstein would be up. ¡@¡@On the eighth floor, the floor nurse said, ¡§I think he¡¦s still in the day room. He likes to read at night. He¡¦s a darling old man.¡¨ ¡@¡@We went to the only room that had any lights on, and there was a man reading a book. The nurse went over to him and asked if he had lost his wallet. Mr. Goldstein looked up with surprise, put his hand in his back pocket and said, ¡§Oh, it is missing!¡¨    ¡§This kind gentleman found a wallet and we wondered if it could be yours.¡¨ ¡@¡@I handed Mr. Goldstein the wallet, and the second he saw it, he smiled with relief and said, ¡§Yes, that¡¦s it! It must have dropped out of my pocket this afternoon. I want to give you a reward.¡¨    ¡§No, thank you,¡¨ I said. ¡§But I have to tell you something. I read the letter in the hope of finding out who owned the wallet.¡¨ ¡@¡@The smile on his face suddenly disappeared. ¡§You read that letter?¡¨    ¡§Not only did I read it, I think I know where Hannah is.¡¨ ¡@¡@He suddenly grew pale25. ¡§Hannah? You know where she is? How is she? Is she still as pretty as she was? Please, please tell me,¡¨ he begged26.    ¡§She¡¦s fine ... just as pretty as when you knew her,¡¨ I said softly. ¡@¡@The old man smiled with anticipation27 and asked, ¡§Could you tell me where she is? I want to call her tomorrow.¡¨ He grabbed my hand and said, ¡§You know something, mister? I was so in love with that girl that when that letter came, my life literally28 ended. I never married. I guess I¡¦ve always loved her.¡¨    ¡§Michael,¡¨ I said, ¡§come with me.¡¨ ¡@¡@We took the elevator down to the third floor. The hallways were darkened and only one or two little night lights lit our way to the day room, where Hannah was sitting alone, watching the television. ¡@¡@The nurse walked over to her.    ¡§Hannah,¡¨ she said softly, pointing to Michael, who was waiting with me in the doorway. ¡§Do you know this man?¡¨ ¡@¡@She adjusted her glasses, looked for a moment, but didn¡¦t say a word. ¡@¡@Michael said softly, almost in a whisper, ¡§Hannah, it¡¦s Michael. Do you remember me?¡¨ ¡@¡@She gasped. ¡§Michael! I don¡¦t believe it! Michael! It¡¦s you! My Michael!¡¨ ¡@¡@He walked slowly toward her, and they embraced29. The nurse and I left with tears streaming30 down our faces.    ¡§See,¡¨ I said. ¡§See how the good Lord works! If it¡¦s meant to be, it will be.¡¨ ¡@¡@About three weeks later, I got a call at my office from the nursing home. ¡§Can you break away on Sunday to attend a wedding? Michael and Hannah are going to tie the knot31!¡¨ ¡@¡@It was a beautiful wedding, with all the people at the nursing home dressed up to join in the celebration. Hannah wore a light beige8 dress and looked beautiful. Michael wore a dark blue suit and stood tall. They made me their best man. ¡@¡@The nursing home gave them their own room, and if you ever wanted to see a seventy-six-year-old bride and a seventy-nine-year-old groom acting like two teenagers, you had to see this couple. ¡@¡@A perfect ending for a love affair that had lasted nearly sixty years. ¡@¡@ 
ï»¿ããMartin Luther King, Jr.* was an influential leader in the African-American* Civil Rights Movement. He preached non-violence in the struggle against racism. He delivered the following speech to a group of students at Barratt Junior High School* in Philadelphia* on October 2th, 1, just six months before he was assassinated. ããI want to ask you a question, and that is: what is your lifeâs blueprint?  ããWhenever a building is constructed, you usually have an architect who draws a blueprint, and that blueprint serves as the pattern, as the guide, and a building is not well erected without a good, solid blueprint. Now each of you is in the process of building the structure of your lives, and the question is whether you have a proper, a solid, and a sound blueprint. I want to suggest some of the things that should begin your lifeâs blueprint. ããNumber one in your lifeâs blueprint should be a deep belief in your own dignity, your worth, and your own somebodiness*. Donât allow anybody to make you feel that youâre nobody. Always feel that you count. Always feel that you have worth, and always feel that your life has ultimate significance. ããSecondly, in your lifeâs blueprint you must have as the basic principle, the determination to achieve excellence in your various fields of endeavor. Youâre going to be deciding as the days, as the years unfold what you will do in lifeâwhat your lifeâs work will be. Set out to do it well. And I say to you, my young friends, doors are opening to youâdoors of opportunities that were not open to your mothers and your fathersâand the great challenge facing you is to be ready to face these doors as they open. ããRalph Waldo Emerson*, the great essayist, said in a lecture in 1, âIf a man can write a better book or preach a better sermon or make a better mousetrap* than his neighbor, even if he builds his house in the woods, the world will make a beaten path to his door.â  ããThis hasnât always been trueâbut it will become increasingly true, and so I would urge you to study hard, to burn the midnight oil; I would say to you: donât drop out of school. I understand all the sociological reasons, but I urge you that in spite of your economic plightâin spite of the situation that youâre forced to live inâstay in school. And when you discover what you will be in your life, set out to do it as if God Almighty* called you at this particular moment in history to do it. Donât just set out to do a good job. Set out to do such a good job that the living, the dead, or the unborn couldnât do it any better. If it falls to your lot to be a street sweeper, sweep streets like Michelangelo* painted pictures, sweep streets like Beethoven composed music, sweep streets like Leontyne Price* sings before the Metropolitan Opera. Sweep streets like Shakespeare wrote poetry. Sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will have to pause and say: here lived a great street sweeper who swept well. ããIf you canât be a pine at the top of the hill, be a shrub in the valley. But be the best little shrub on the side of the hill. Be a bush if you canât be a tree. If you canât be a highway, just be a trail. If you canât be a sun, be a star. For it isnât by size that you win or fail. Be the best of whatever you are. ããDonât allow anybody to pull you so low as to make you hate them. Donât allow anybody to cause you to lose your self-respect to the point that you do not struggle for justiceâhowever young you are. You have a responsibility to seek to make your nation a better nation in which to live. You have a responsibility to seek to make life better for everybody. And so you must be involved in the struggle for freedom and justice. 
Rules That Work Wonders. ¡@¡@Have you ever walked into a house and felt at home right away? Was it the furnishings that created a relaxed atmosphere? Or was it the light and air that made you feel so comfortable? Perhaps you weren't aware of it, but the answer might lie in good feng shui. Feng shui, literally "wind water" in Chinese, means "natural surroundings." It is the art of achieving harmony with the environment through the proper arrangement of the objects within and around the house. It is also the practice of harnessing chi , an invisible flow of energy that surrounds us. With smoothly flowing chi around, you can lead a life of happiness and prosperity. ¡@¡@According to the philosophy of feng shui, the most important room in a house is the bedroom, because where and how you sleep is important for preserving the strength and spirit you need to face the world. To ensure the best flow of chi in the room, your bed should be diagonally opposite the room's main entrance. This will give you the serene feelings that make proper rest possible. If it is impossible to make such an arrangement, do bear in mind that you should never place your bed in alignment with the door, because in ancient China, the deceased were laid out with their feet pointing toward the door so that they would have easier access to heaven. Besides, never put a bed under a slanting ceiling or exposed beams, because the angular protrusions will cause sha, or bad chi, which can give you pains, make your thoughts confused and perplexed, and cause you other problems Though mirrors have a positive effect in the other rooms of the home, it is the opposite case with the bedroom. It is said that if a mirror faces your bed, your spirit, which may rise from your body at night, will be shocked when facing its own image. ¡@¡@Just as good feng shui in the bedroom can help you feel refreshed, so will good feng shui in your study promote your ability to concentrate. According to the principles of feng shui, your study should be in the southern or northeastern corner of the house because the south represents fame and fortune; the northeast, knowledge and intelligence. However, if this is not practicable, the position of your desk will be of crucial importance. According to the rule mentioned above, your desk should be placed in the southern or northeastern corner of the room. In addition, because a solid wall behind you can provide more backing for your ideas, sit with your back to the wall. If this option is not available, be sure not to sit with your back to the door so that you won't be easily frightened by those who enter your room. Also, don't position your desk facing the windows. Ideally, windows should be to the side of your desk to avoid the glare of the sun. Most importantly, if your room is next to a bathroom, never place your desk so that it is near the toilet, only separated from it by a wall. ¡@¡@ The Chinese believe that they cannot change the destiny they are born with, but that they may change their luck with effort and wisdom. Using the philosophy of feng shui, they may make wise and positive changes in their lives. If you wish to assist yourself or your family in achieving your and their goals, use the principles of feng shui, and you will be amazed at how many windows are opened to you.   
Weather Phenomena. ¡@¡@All around the world, strange things have been falling from the sky. Eyewitnesses have reported seeing fish and frog rainstorms. Others have seen falling ice the size of baseballs and balls of light dancing in the sky. These may sound like jokes, but these kinds of weird weather reports have been around for hundreds of years. ¡@¡@An early report came from Worcester, England, in 1881. Townspeople saw masses of crabs and snails fall to the ground during a thunderstorm. Another incident was reported in Kansas City, Missouri in 1873, when hundreds of frogs came down with the rain. Similar reports have continued throughout the years in Wales, India, and Singapore, to name a few. A more recent one came from the mountain village of Korona in Greece in 2004. Villagers saw heaps of tiny fish come down during a rain shower. ¡@¡@Some scientists believe that these freak storms can be explained by strong winds that move above a body of water. These powerful winds suck up everything in their way into the storm clouds. The clouds carry the objects for a while before releasing them with rain. Fish have been carried hundreds of miles before being released by the clouds during a rainstorm. Because the clouds are very high up, the temperature is very cold-- so cold that there have been reports of frozen fish falling to the ground!  ¡@¡@Fish and frogs are not the only strange things falling from the sky during a storm. Giant hailstones are another weather condition that is out of the ordinary. Giant hail can damage cars and crops and can even kill small animals. Hail forms from rain and ice in the clouds. Windy conditions prevent the water from falling and blow it up higher to colder temperatures. As it goes up, the rain freezes into hail. Its heavy weight makes it fall. However, strong winds may blow the hail back up again, causing it to get even bigger and heavier as more water freezes onto it. The hail gets bigger and bigger. Finally, such is the size of the hail that the wind can no longer blow it upward, and it falls to the ground. ¡@¡@Yet another phenomenon that comes from the sky is strange balls of light called ball lightning. Many people from all over the world have reported seeing these eerie glowing balls dancing in the sky during a violent thunderstorm. Ball lightning is unpredictable. It might glide parallel to the ground, but it might also bounce like a ball. There are various sizes of ball lightning. It can be as small as a baseball or as big as a car. Ball lightning is usually red and yellow, changing to white before disappearing. With the disappearance of ball lightning, there might be a loud bang along with a bright color. Generally, ball lightning lasts for about twenty seconds, but it might stay around for a few minutes. There are numerous theories about ball lightning but scientists can't agree on exactly what it is or why it behaves the way it does. ¡@¡@As scientists gain more and more knowledge about meteorology, we will eventually find out the causes of these mysterious phenomena. Whatever the causes are, these strange weather phenomena will continue to fascinate, or bother, people around the world. 
Lincoln¡¦s High Hopes for His Son. ¡@¡@Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809¡VApril 15, 1865), the sixteenth president of the United States, was born into an unremarkable family. Since his childhood, he had been exposed to anti-slavery sentiment at the slave auctions he used to witness. In his political career, Lincoln was fully devoted to emancipating slaves, and as president he supported the antislavery, pro-Union North in the American Civil War (1861¡V1865). As the Federal Army moved toward victory in a war that caused many deaths and casualties on both sides, Lincoln finally realized his dream of abolishing slavery. His strong belief in democracy and equality is clear in his famous Gettysburg Address, in which he stated that ¡§government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.¡¨ In 1865, Lincoln¡¦s assassination shocked the whole nation, yet never will his dedication to preserving the unity of the United States be forgotten. ¡@¡@Lincoln, an honorable statesman, also played the role of an ordinary father. He wrote a letter to his son¡¦s teacher in the hope of shaping his son into a man of decency, compassion, and persistence, characteristics valued by Lincoln. In this letter we can see a father¡¦s great expectations for his child, and at the same time appreciate Lincoln¡¦s powerful rhetoric. The following is the letter.  ¡@¡@He will have to learn, I know, that all men are not just, all men are not true.  But teach him also that for every scoundre there is a hero; that for every selfish politician, there is a dedicated leader ...Teach him for every enemy there is a friend. ¡@¡@Steer him away from envy, if you can, teach him the secret of quiet laughter. ¡@¡@Let him learn early that the bullies are the easiest to lick ... ¡@¡@Teach him, if you can, the wonder of books ... ¡@¡@But also give him quiet time to ponder the eternal mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun, and the flowers on a green hillside. ¡@¡@In the school teach him it is far more honorable to fail than to cheat ... ¡@¡@Teach him to have faith in his own ideas, even if everyone tells him they are wrong ... ¡@¡@Teach him to be gentle with gentle people, and tough with the tough. ¡@¡@Try to give my son the strength not to follow the crowd ¡@¡@when everyone is getting on the bandwagon. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Teach him to listen to all men ... ¡@¡@but teach him also to filter all he hears on a screen of truth, ¡@¡@and take only the good that comes through. ¡@¡@ ¡@¡@Teach him if you can, how to laugh when he is sad ... ¡@¡@Teach him there is no shame in tears, ¡@¡@Teach him to scoff at cynics and to beware of too much sweetness ... ¡@¡@ Teach him to sell his brawn and brain to the highest bidders but never to put a price tag on his heart and soul. Teach him to close his ears to a howling mob and to stand and fight if he thinks he¡¦s right. Treat him gently, but do not cuddle him, because only the test of fire makes final steel. Let him have the courage to be impatient ... let him have the patience to be brave. Teach him always to have sublime faith in himself, because then he will have sublime faith in mankind. This is a big order, but see what you can do ... He is such a fine fellow, my son! 
The Magic Source of Strength in Sports. ¡@¡@Did you know that some lawyers wear the same suit throughout the course of a trial in order to win a court case? Have you ever visited the local Wenchang Temple for good luck on the test you¡¦re about to take? It seems that to ensure victory, some people resort to supernatural methods, and those from different walks of life may develop certain eccentric rituals. Given the increasingly high salaries and more and more intense competition in the world of professional sports, it should come as no surprise that professional athletes are turning to superstitious rituals more than ever before. In fact, superstitions prevail in the world of sports. ¡@¡@Imagine a baseball player talking to his bat or even sleeping with it. Weird as it may sound, some Major League Baseball (MLB) players believe in this kind of magic. Some are also convinced that spitting on their hands before picking up the bat will enable them to get a hit. When running off the field at the end of an inning, some players make a point of stepping on one of the bases or are cautious not to touch the baselines so that they won¡¦t have bad luck. Certain National Basketball Association1 (NBA) players have made it a ritual to wipe the soles of their sneakers before every game. The player who happens to be the last to shoot a basket during the warm-up may take it as a sign that he will be the luckiest player in the game. In fact, players¡¦ seemingly habitual practice of dribbling before a foul shot was originally a superstitious ritual to bring good luck. As for American football players, they won¡¦t take a new number when they transfer to another team. Also, many football teams have a tradition of touching something like a statue before taking the field. In the golf world, coins play an important role: golfers use them to mark the position of their ball. Since all golfers hope to shoot a 65 or 66, dimes from the mid-1960s are popular. Also, some golfers will start a game using only an odd-numbered club.  ¡@¡@It seems that the heavier the burden an athlete must bear, the more likely he or she is to develop some irrational rituals. Take, for example, Yani Tseng¡Xthe Taiwanese golfer who now ranks number one in the world. She requested that her fans support her by wearing pink, her lucky color. She also makes it a habit to have fried rice with chicken and cucumber when she is about to play a round of golf. Michael Jordan, one of the most prominent basketball players of all time, derived some of his confidence from the shorts he had worn while at North Carolina University; he always wore the lucky shorts under his Bulls uniform. In another example, the Spanish soccer star Raul was once scolded for wearing a yellow T-shirt during a training session just because his coach, Luis Aragones, thought yellow would bring bad luck. But perhaps the best-known case of a superstitious athlete is that of Wade Boggs, a player for the Boston Red Sox and Baseball Hall of Famer. Boggs would eat only poultry before every game. He also had a time fixation: he always entered the batting cage at exactly 5:17 p.m. and ran wind sprints at 7:17 p.m. ¡@¡@Of course, it is athletes¡¦ competence, along with physical fitness and their desire to defeat their opponents, that actually enables them to win games, including championship ones. At least, this is the normal, rational explanation. The problem is that in hyper-competitive games played by world-class athletes, it is always very possible that a game will be lost by just one crucial point or run or goal. It is probably a mere matter of good or bad luck in the eyes of those who have just won or lost. Thus, as Larry King once said, ¡§Those who have succeeded at anything and don¡¦t mention luck are kidding themselves.¡¨ So, when you stop to think about success in sports, you realize that there may be two sides to this coin after all. 
Wake Up Your Life. ¡@¡@Years ago, when I started looking for my first job, wise advisers urged, ¡§Barbara, be enthusiastic! Enthusiasm will take you further than any amount of experience.¡¨ ¡@¡@How right they were. Enthusiastic people can turn a boring drive into an adventure, extra work into opportunity and strangers into friends.  ¡@¡@¡§Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm,¡¨ wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. It is the paste that helps you hang in there when the going gets tough. It is the inner voice that whispers, ¡§I can do it!¡¨ when others shout, ¡§No, you can¡¦t.¡¨  ¡@¡@It took years and years for the early work of Barbara McClintock, a geneticist who won the 1983 Nobel Prize in medicine, to be generally accepted. Yet she didn¡¦t let up on her experiments. Work was such a great pleasure for her that she never thought of stopping. ¡@¡@We are all born with wide-eyed, enthusiastic wonder as anyone knows who has ever seen an infant¡¦s delight at the jingle of keys or the scurrying of a beetle. ¡@¡@It is this childlike wonder that gives enthusiastic people such a youthful air, whatever their age.  ¡@¡@At ninety, cellist Pablo Casals would start his day by playing Bach. As the music flowed through his fingers, his stooped shoulders would straighten and joy would reappear in his eyes. Music, for Casals, was an elixir that made life a never-ending adventure. As author and poet Samuel Ullman once wrote, ¡§Years wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.¡¨ ¡@¡@How do you rediscover the enthusiasm of your childhood? The answer, I believe, lies in the word itself. ¡§Enthusiasm¡¨ comes from the Greek and means ¡§God within.¡¨ And what is God within is but an abiding sense of love¡Xproper love of self (self-acceptance) and, from that, love of others.         Enthusiastic people also love what they do, regardless of money or title or power. If we cannot do what we love as a full-time career, we can as a part-time avocation, like the head of state who paints, the nun who runs marathons, the executive who handcrafts furniture. ¡@¡@Elizabeth Layton of Wellsville, Kansas, was sixty-eight before she began to draw. This activity ended bouts of depression that had plagued her for at least thirty years, and the quality of her work led one critic to say, ¡§I am tempted to call Layton a genius.¡¨ Elizabeth has rediscovered her enthusiasm. ¡@¡@We can¡¦t afford to waste tears on ¡§might-have-beens.¡¨ We need to turn the tears into sweat as we go after ¡§what-can-be.¡¨ ¡@¡@We need to live each moment wholeheartedly, with all our senses¡Xfinding pleasure in the fragrance of a backyard garden, the crayoned picture of a six-year-old, or the enchanting beauty of a rainbow. It is such enthusiastic love of life that puts a sparkle in our eyes and a lilt in our steps, and smoothes the wrinkles from our souls. 
ï»¿Feeling sad is one of the important aspects of human nature. Here are findings by some experts, who tell us how and why feeling sad is a good way to deal with troubles in our life. ããIn one of his books, Jerome Wakefield1, a professor at New York University, mentions that feeling down after your heart is broken is normal and may even be beneficial. Recently, Wakefieldâs students have been coming up to him after they broke up with a boyfriend or girlfriend because their parents are pressuring them to seek counseling and other medical intervention1 for their sadness; often the kids want no part of it. âCan you talk to them for me?â they ask Wakefield. Rather than âlistening to medicine,â they want to listen to their hearts. His argument is that these studentsâ response reflects an important aspect of human nature.  ããUniversity of Illinois2 psychologist Ed Diener3, who has studied happiness for a quarter2 century, finds that the Scots4 and many other peoples like being gloomy3, and donât appreciate being told they should be happier. âThey say too much happiness might not be such a good thing, no matter where it comes from,â says Diener. He believes itâs wrong for the âhappiness industryâ to send the message that moderate levels of well-being4 arenât enough: not only can we all be happier, but we practically5 have a duty6 to be so. He argues that what was considered normal sadness is not something to be smothered5, or avoided. ããEric Wilson6, a professor of English at Wake Forest University7, made every effort to smooth out his habitual7 frown8 and wear a sunny smile, since a happy expression can lead to genuinely9 happy feelings. He even began to exercise his capacity for enthusiasm10. When neither of these made him happy, he accepted his melancholy11 side again and concluded that such a happiness movement was no good for him at all. Americansâ fixation8 on happiness, he writes, fosters12 a craven9 disregard13 for the value of sadness.  ããThese academics14 believe the problem of constant, extreme happiness should not be surprising, since negative emotions evolved for a reason. Fear tips us off to the presence of danger, for instance15. Sadness, too, seems to be part of our biological16 heritage: apes, dogs and elephants all display17 something that looks like sadness. A study finds that those with the greatest sense of well-being were more likely to die in any given period of time than the mildly content were. Being âupâ all the time can cause you to play down very real threats18. ããThey further argue that only by experiencing sadness can we experience the fullness of the human condition. Their studies show that when you are in a negative frame of mind, you become more logical, more critical and more innovative19. Abraham Lincoln was not limited by his dark moods, and Beethoven10 composed his later works in a melancholic11 state. Vincent van Gogh11, Emily Dickinson12 and other artistic geniuses20 saw the world through a glass darkly. Even the creator of  âPeanuts13,â Charles M. Schulz14, was known for his gloom3. ãã People who are somewhat21 discontented22 are more motivated to improve both their own lot and the lot of their community. In contrast, people at the top of the happiness charts23 feel no such urgency24. âIf youâre totally satisfied with your life and with how things are going in the world,â says Diener, âyou donât feel very motivated to work for change. Be wary25 when people tell you that you should be happier.â  
ï»¿ ããMoney. You have a whole lifetime2 to earn, save, invest3, and spend it. Yet, in order to avoid costly4 mistakes and wasted time, you probably should learn how to do these when you are still young. This is your opportunity to learn how to make the most of every penny5 so you can achieve the financial independence you wantâwhen you need it. The two most basic things to achieve this are setting goals and budgeting6. Setting goals  ããGoal setting is your chance to figure out what you really want to do with your money and to get what you want without having to borrow for it.  ããThere are three basic types of goals: short-term (achievable7 in less than a year), mid-term (achievable in one to five years), and long-term (achievable in more than five years). Determine how much your goals will cost you and the dates you want them by. If you have multiple8 goals, you can either work toward them all at once or concentrate on one and then move to the next. You can use the Financial Goals Chart to list your goals.  ããHow much do you need to put aside each month? For short- and  mid-term goals, the calculation9 is simple: the price divided10 by the months you have to save equals how much you need to put aside each month. For long-term goals, you may want to factor11 in the interest12 you expect to earn on your savings13. You can use free online financial calculators9 to determine how much you need to put aside each month.  How much will I need to save for a major purchase? Compute: Need to save $3,849.63 each month for 5 years.  Budgeting.  ããWhile the idea of budgeting may sound overwhelming14, it is just knowing what you have coming in and restricting what goes out. A  well-designed budget6 allows you to make the most of your moneyâyou will reduce your wasteful15 spending and be able to afford the things you need. ããTo design a budget, you can use the old-fashioned system (pen and paper), a computer spreadsheet1, or a budgeting software16. The method matters less than the result.  ãã Begin with your income (using the budget worksheet), as it will determine what you can afford to spend and save each month. Total up every net17 (already taxed18) dollar you make in a month. Now move on to your expenses. When developing this section, you should have two columns19 to work withâa âcurrentâ column, for what you have been spending your money on, and a âproposed20â column, for the changes you want to make. In the current column, list everything you spend your money on in a month. Include periodic expenses, such as birthday gifts, weekend trips, or concert tickets as well. Just total what you think you spend in a year, and divide the number by 12 to get a monthly21 figure. Donât forget to include money for savingsâboth for your goals and emergency, unexpected22 expenses.  Monthly Income. Gross. Net. Job. Allowance. Student loans . Other. TOTAL PER MONTH. Monthly Expenses. Current. Proposed. Water/Garbage. Cellphone. Internet access. Health/Life insurance. Prescriptions/Doctor visits. Tuition/Lessons. Beauty/Barber. Movies/Music. Dining out. Sports/Hobbies/Gym. Vacations/Travel. Books/Magazines. Clothing purchases. Gifts/Cards. Savings (emergency account). Savings (goals). Other. TOTAL PER MONTH. Monthly Income. Monthly expenses. Monthly balance. ããThough everyoneâs budget is different, there is one basic rule that applies to allâyour expenses should never be more than your income. Total your expenses and subtract23 the sum from your net income. Are you over or under? If you find there is more going out than is coming in, it is time to make changes. You can increase your income, decrease24 your expenses, or do both. Using the current column as a guide, consider each expense carefully. Which are wants? Which are needs? In the proposed column, decide where you want your dollars to go each month and what you can cut.  ããA budget is born. Make a commitment to follow it in the future. Otherwise, your budget is only a piece of paper. You may not be able to perfectly stick to it every single month, but do the best you can.  ããFinally, with appropriate225 goals and budget planning, you will learn how to manage your money wisely. The time will come when you will be able to earn, save, spend, and even invest your money properly26.  
Unit 8  Waste Not, Want Not. 	Recent visitors to Haiti may be shocked to find a scene that has become common for many of the local residents: locals eating mud cakes. Made with clay and a little margarine and salt, these cakes are used by Haitians to keep their hunger at bay. Mud cakes are definitely not delicious, and the heavy metals and parasites that they contain have greatly affected the health of the Haitians who eat them. Sad to say, there seems to be no quick solution to this situation. Owing to catastrophic domestic crop shortages and the soaring prices of imported goods, not to mention the terrible earthquake of 2010, Haiti has been listed as one of the world¡¦s hungriest countries. Moreover, farmers in Haiti aren¡¦t able to grow food fast enough to feed every islander, which makes this country even hungrier than ever. 	Unfortunately, food crises have broken out not just in Haiti¡Xthey have occurred around the globe. According to a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than thirty nations have long endured famine-like conditions. To compare and contrast what people eat, writer Faith D¡¦Aluisio and photographer Peter Menzel visited several places and spent months examining the diets of 30 different families in 24 countries. The Aboubakars, the family that D¡¦Aluisio and Menzel stayed with in Chad, ate about $24.40 worth of food a week. The bulk of their weekly diet consisted of 39.3 pounds of sorghum. Other items for the family of six to share included five small limes, around seven pounds of vegetables and nuts, and about two liters of sunflower oil. With no access to dairy, their only ¡§luxuries¡¨ were salt, pepper, and a handful of ginger for flavor. 	D¡¦Aluisio and Menzel also visited one family in the United States: the Revis in North Carolina. If we compare the Aboubakars¡¦ weekly diet with the Revis¡¦, the mind will boggle at the differences between the two. In one week, the Revis¡¦ food expenditure exceeded $340. They enjoyed a variety of grains and starches. They consumed milk, butter, several kinds of cheese, meat, fish, and all the fruits and vegetables they wanted. What¡¦s more, the money they spent on drinks, such as juice, soda, and alcohol, to name but a few, was $77.75, which is over three times the amount of the total food budget of the Aboubakars. 	Serious as it is in some parts of the world, the problem of food shortages is actually preventable. In 2009, a study carried out by the United Nations Environment Programme mentioned that over half of the world¡¦s food was wasted. About one quarter of fruit and vegetables in the United States were thrown away, and one third of food in the United Kingdom did not get eaten. In Toronto, Canada, each family produces an average of 606 kilograms of waste annually, which works out at 441 million kilograms of food waste for this city. If the world¡¦s food supply is more carefully managed, the amount saved will be large enough to feed every hungry person on the planet. 	In Taiwan, food shortages may not seem as urgent as those in Haiti. However, some people in Taiwan, like those in other countries, do not cherish their food. If they keep wasting food, they are bound to face food shortages sooner or later. To prevent this from happening, some minor adjustments can be made and, better yet, help to improve the problem of food shortages around the world. For instance, we can start by assessing our food needs, and then purchase just what we require every time we shop. When we dine at an all-you-can-eat restaurant, we should make sure that our eyes are not bigger than our stomach, so that we won¡¦t put too much food on our tray. These are just a few examples; the list can go on and on. What counts is that we should keep this global issue in mind and stop ourselves from wasting food. With just a little effort, the global food crisis will not become a problem that is too big to be tackled. ¡XBy Douglas A. Hinnant
¡@¡@For many people, there seems to be no escape from poverty. Imagine a poor woman who has an idea for a small business to lift2 herself and her family out of poverty. She goes to a bank to borrow a little money. At this bank, as at most banks, the borrower3 must meet three criteria1: character (being honest), capacity (being able to run a business), and collateral2 (owning something valuable). However, the bank won¡¦t lend the money to this poor woman because she doesn¡¦t have any collateral. In such a situation, there seems to be no way for the woman to break the cycle of poverty. ¡@¡@One possible solution these days is microlending¢wa system of special banks and programs that are loaning4 money to people in ¡§borrowing groups.¡¨ For example, an international organization called Good Faith4 lends small amounts of money to people who want to go into business. Each person must do two things first: take classes in business and join a borrowing group. Everyone in the group must approve the loan of every other group member. They must have character and capacity in the business classes. Collateral is not necessary any longer. Instead, group members make sure that each person pays back his or her loan. ¡@¡@Good Faith has had many successes and only a few failures. In Pine Bluff5, Arkansas6, a small town in the U.S.A., one person was able to open a hair salon7, another a plant shop, and still another, a car-decorating5 business¢wall with loans from Good Faith. In developing countries such as Bangladesh8, a person can buy a cow or a sewing6 machine and begin a small business with only $20 to $50. Because of many small loans from Good Faith, there are now 1.6 million new entrepreneurs9 in Bangladesh helping to improve the country¡¦s economy. Of course, not all these loans were a success. At first, Good Faith lent half of the money to men and half to women. Unfortunately, most of the Bangladeshi8 men spent the money on themselves, not the business. Now Good Faith does business mainly7 with women¡¦s borrowing groups in that country. ¡@¡@The primary goal of Good Faith and other similar programs is to eliminate9 poverty. However, as poverty has decreased, there have been some surprising secondary effects. One of them has been a change in the social status of women. Traditionally, in some societies, people thought of women as worthless10. But when a woman is eligible11 for loans and is able to demonstrate her capacity for business, she often receives respect from the male12 members of her family and from the entire village. Therefore, women can elevate13 their position in addition to bringing wealth into the family and society when given a chance. ¡@¡@In many countries, women are the poorest of the poor. They produce more than half of the world¡¦s food, but they own just one percent of the world¡¦s land. They comprise14 51 percent of the world¡¦s population, but very little money goes to programs to help them. Therefore, besides organizations creating borrowing groups for women, others fund special projects to help women. In the late 1980s, Anne F. Murray11 began the Global Fund for Women. It has authorized15 money for over 400 women¡¦s groups in 94 countries. The main focus is to help find solutions to social ills16 such as violence17 and lack of education. For instance, the fund has helped a group of Palestinian12 and Jewish13 women who are working together to stop violence against women. It is giving money to a woman in a village in southern India who has started a literacy18 program to teach poor women to read. ¡@¡@Good Faith and the Global Fund for Women have taught banks around the world that it is a safe bet19 to lend money to some of the poor. With careful planning, education, and cooperation20, most people use the money well and then plow14 the money and knowledge back into their communities. There is considerable hope that they can begin to break the cycle of poverty for themselves, their families, and society. 
How the University Is Accountable to Parents and Students. A Speech to Freshmen and Parents by Drew Faust1, President of Harvard University2. Cambridge, Massachusetts3. October 26, 2007. ¡@¡@Hello, Class of 2011.  Welcome back. Seven weeks ago you sat in this audience2 to begin a journey¢wa journey through four years of college with the most diverse group of classmates we have ever admitted. On that day in September, I challenged the freshmen to explore the rich treasures of the University, to experience the stimulating energy of its museums and professors and research laboratories, and begin a life of risk and reward3 at Harvard. ¡@¡@In my opening address two weeks ago, I ventured4 a definition of what accountability1 means on campus¢wthat it means being accountable to the past and to the future, and not simply to the present. A university has a longer view. It is not about a report of the day¡¦s gains and losses, but about endeavors5 we pursue in part for their own sake, because over the centuries they have defined what makes us human. Today I want to focus on two things: first, we are accountable for teaching students well; second, we are accountable for helping students change for the better.  ¡@¡@First, teaching. Teaching is at the heart of what we do at a research university. The students of Harvard College are not only part of a much larger place; they are at its core. The faculty has always tried their best to assure that exceedingly6 outstanding7 teaching is a basic part of the undergraduate8 experience. The extraordinary9 opportunities10 undergraduates find, no matter which college or institute you are at Harvard, come about not only because students wade right in, but because of pioneering11 scholars who care deeply about teaching.  ¡@¡@Never has it been more important for faculty to embrace12 technology. The Internet is changing the ways of learning, enhancing13 classroom teaching in unexpected and marvelous14 ways¢wnot replacing the essential15 exchange between teacher and student, but giving it new forms and rich variety. Ninety percent of Harvard courses16, 5,000 a year, have websites. Discussion boards and blogs4 extend in-class discussion. Online maps and archives17 are a click away.  ¡@¡@Second, the University is accountable for delivering a different person, upon graduation, from the one who came to us as a freshman. College is a place for students to cultivate a culture of unruliness5, a zone18 of questioning and openness19 and new creation. As W. B. Yeats6 put it, ¡§Education is not filling a bucket, but lighting20 a fire.¡¨  ¡@¡§College is a time where one should dare21 to make mistakes,¡¨ wrote senior Matthew Blumenthal7 for a New York Times essay contest this summer. ¡§College should push the limits of students¡¦ comfort zones in new and meaningful ways,¡¨ he said. These two sentences are similar to Mark Twain¡¦s command22 to ¡§sail away from safe harbor.¡¨ Exactly. The graduating sons and daughters who leave here four years from now may have sailed far, far away from any land or harbor you ever imagined. We are here to keep students on that journey¢wto help them make choices that may not make sense to you, or even to us, to encourage them to take risks, to put themselves to sea from the safe harbor.  ¡@¡@This happens as much, if not more, outside the classroom than in. It means that, you might study in Israel8 at a center for integrating archaeology9 and natural science; or spend a summer in Mexico¡¦s health ministry23; or discover that you can start a program to help teenagers with disease in Ghana10. Once you are here, you realize that you belong, inspired by others who are similarly, passionately24 involved. Such is the value of venturing beyond the bounds of the college. ¡@¡@You are the first freshmen I have welcomed as president of the University. We begin our journeys together. Journeys are never easy. Dr. Samuel E. Morrison11 a legendary Harvard professor, also told us that in any journey of risk and reward, the joy is in the journey, bound to hold in store what he called long periods of pure delight such as only a seaman12 may know, and moments of high, proud happiness that only a discoverer can experience. Thank you.
Unit 5 Death by Tourism. 	At the entrance to one of the ancient temples of Petra in Jordan, there is an inscription carved deeply into the soft red rock. It looks as if it has been there for centuries. It could have been written by one of King Herod¡¦s soldiers, when they were imprisoned in this town in 37 B.C. But closer inspection reveals that it is not so ancient after all. It reads: 	Shane and Wendy from Sydney were here. April 16, 1996.  	The ruins of Petra were discovered in 1812, but a recent report has concluded that they ¡§are in grave danger of being destroyed by the unstoppable march of tourism.¡¨ More than 4,000 tourists a day tramp through Petra¡¦s rocky tombs, wearing away the soft red sandstone, and gradually turning it into a powder. Some thoughtless visitors have so little reverence for this sacred place that they think nothing of scratching their names on the rock there. 	However, it is not just Petra that is under threat of destruction. More than 600 million tourists a year now travel the globe, and, understandably, vast numbers of them want to visit the world¡¦s most treasured sites, such as India¡¦s Taj Mahal, England¡¦s Stonehenge, and the national parks of Kenya. Many destinations that were once too remote to visit are now just a flight or bus trip away, and many have become part of inexpensive package tours. Because of the tourist industry, these sites are now being visited by millions of people annually. 	In addition to the above tourist attractions, tourists are flocking to the neighborhood of the Mediterranean Sea, too. The population of 130 million there can swell to 230 million each summer. The once splendid and untouched landscape there now consists of mile after mile of hotels. Yet, this current rate of visitors to the Mediterranean is nothing compared to a disturbing projection made by the United Nations¡Xthe Mediterranean region could host 760 million holidaymakers by the year of 2025. In Spain, France, Italy, and most of Greece, there is very little undeveloped coastline left, and the Mediterranean Sea has become the most contaminated sea in the whole world. 	To make matters worse, sightseers are causing serious damage to historic sites just by visiting them. Their sightseeing is actually destroying the very things that they want to see. For instance, 7,000 visitors an hour trample in and out of Notre Dame Cathedral each day. On a typical day, thirty-five buses, having let their passengers out, wait outside, with the fumes from their engines continuously eating away the delicate stonework of the monument. 	Not all of the news is gloomy, however. Governments are now becoming more aware of the deterioration of these valuable areas and sites, and they are taking action. For example, in Taiwan, the Fushan Botanical Garden has been established to protect part of the island¡¦s natural environment. Different from scenic spots, this reservation shields the area¡¦s natural life by strictly limiting the number of visitors to just 600 during the weekends and requiring visitors to apply in advance for a special entry permit. Additionally, many areas of the park are off-limits to tourists, which means that a lot of wildlife is left undisturbed. Moreover, an education center has been built to teach visitors to have an enhanced respect for the natural environment. These measures have led to an increase in the number of plants and animals in and around the reservation. 	It used to be unquestioned that travel broadens the mind, but how can this possibly be true when the explosive growth of tourism eventually would leave nothing but ruins for the visitors to see? If uncontrolled, tourism will continue to take its toll on our cultural and natural treasures, and these things cannot be restored once they have been spoiled. To cushion these places from greater damage, governments should set up clear guiding principles to encourage more public participation in environmental conservation. As for tourists, they should adopt a stronger sense of responsibility and morality. After all, visiting amazing places around the world should be a privilege, rather than something that is taken for granted. ¡XAdapted from ¡§Death by Tourism¡XDoes Tourism Ruin Everything That It Touches?¡¨ by Giles Milton.
Unit 7 The Woman That Never Dies. 	There¡¦s a photo on my wall of a woman I¡¦ve never met, its left corner torn and patched together with tape. It¡¦s the late 1940s, and she hasn¡¦t yet attained the age of thirty. Her light brown skin is smooth, her eyes still young and playful. She is unaware of the tumor growing inside her¡Xa tumor that would leave her five children motherless and that would also give rise to the evolution of medicine. Beneath the photo, a caption says this woman¡¦s name is ¡§Henrietta Lacks, Helen Lane, or Helen Larson.¡¨ 	No one knows who took that picture, but it has appeared innumerable times in magazines and science textbooks, and on blogs and on laboratory walls. She¡¦s usually identified as Helen Lane, but generally speaking, she has no name at all. She¡¦s simply called HeLa, the code name given to the world¡¦s first immortal human cells¡Xher cells, cut from her cervix just months before she died. 	Her real name is Henrietta Lacks. 	I¡¦ve spent years gazing at that photo, pondering what kind of life she led, what happened to her offspring, and what she would think about cells from her cervix living on forever¡Xbought, sold, packaged, and shipped by the trillions to laboratories around the world. I¡¦ve tried to imagine how she¡¦d feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most notable advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, and in vitro fertilization. I¡¦m pretty confident that she¡Xlike most of us¡Xwould be staggered to hear that there are now an infinite number of her cells growing in laboratories. 	There¡¦s no way of knowing exactly how many of Henrietta¡¦s cells are alive today. One scientist estimates that if we could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they¡¦d weigh more than 50 billion kilograms¡Xan inconceivable number, given that an individual cell weighs almost nothing. Another scientist calculated that if we could lay all HeLa cells ever grown end-to-end, they¡¦d wrap around the earth at least three times, spanning more than 350 million feet. In her prime, Henrietta herself stood only a bit over five feet tall. 	Henrietta died in 1951 from a brutal case of cervical cancer. But before she expired, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. Scientists had been trying to keep human cells alive in culture for decades, but they all eventually died. Henrietta¡¦s were different: They reproduced an entire generation every twenty-four hours, and they never stopped. In this unprecedented development, they became the first immortal human cells ever grown in a laboratory. 	Henrietta¡¦s cells have now been living outside her body far longer than they ever lived inside it. If we go to almost any cell-culture lab in the world and open its freezers, we¡¦ll probably find millions¡Xif not billions¡Xof Henrietta¡¦s cells in small vials on ice. 	Many people believe that HeLa cells have been one of the most important developments in medicine over the last hundred years. But frankly speaking, no one really knew much about this woman. 	Years later, I finally tracked down a few magazine articles from the seventies about her. Ebony quoted Henrietta¡¦s husband, ¡§All I remember is that she had this disease, and right after she died, they called me in the office wanting to get my permission to take a sample of some kind. I decided not to let them.¡¨Jet said the family was angry¡Xangry that Henrietta¡¦s cells were being sold for twenty-five dollars a vial, and angry that articles had been published about the cells without their knowledge. It said, ¡§Pounding in the back of their heads was a gnawing feeling that science and the press had taken advantage of them.¡¨ 	The articles all ran photos of Henrietta¡¦s family. The caption said the family had learned just a few months earlier that Henrietta¡¦s cells were still alive, whereas at that point, she¡¦d been dead for twenty-five years. Then, I came up with the idea that I¡¦d write a book that was a biography of both the cells and the woman they came from¡Xsomeone¡¦s daughter, wife, and mother. ¡XAdapted from ¡§Prologue¡XThe Woman in the Photograph¡¨ in The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot.
