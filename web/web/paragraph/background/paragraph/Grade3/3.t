Three Days to See.      I have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days at some time during his early adult life. Darkness would make him more appreciative of sight; silence would teach him the joys of sound.      Now and then I have tested my seeing friends to discover what they see. Recently I was visited by a very good friend who had just returned from a long walk in the woods, and I asked her what she had observed. °ßNothing in particular,°® she replied. I might have been incredulous1 had I not been accustomed to such responses, for long ago I became convinced that the seeing see little.      How was it possible, I asked myself, to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing worthy of note? I, who cannot see, find hundreds of things to interest me through mere touch. I feel the delicate2 symmetry1 of a leaf. I pass my hands lovingly about the smooth skin of a silver birch2, or the rough3, shaggy3 bark4 of a pine5. In spring I touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud6, the first sign of awakening4 Nature after her winter°¶s sleep. Occasionally, if I am very fortunate, I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel the happy quiver5 of a bird in full song. I am delighted to have the cool waters of a brook7 rush through my open fingers. To me a lush8 carpet9 of pine needles or spongy6 grass is more welcome than the most luxurious7 Persian10 rug11.       At times my heart cries out with longing8 to see all these things. If I can get so much pleasure9 from mere touch, how much more beauty must be revealed10 by sight. Yet, those who have eyes apparently11 see little. The panorama12 of color and action which fills the world is taken for granted. It is human, perhaps, to appreciate little that which we have and to long for that which we have not, but it is a great pity that in the world of light the gift of sight is used only as a mere convenience rather than as a means of adding fullness to life. If, by some miracle, I were granted three seeing days,      I should want to see the people whose kindness and gentleness and companionship13 have made my life worth14 living. First I should like to gaze15 long upon the face of my dear teacher, Mrs. Anne Sullivan Macy12, who came to me when I was a child and opened the outer world to me. I should want not merely to see the outline16 of her face, so that I could cherish it in my memory, but to study that face and find in it the living evidence of the sympathetic tenderness17 and patience with which she accomplished the difficult task of my education. I should like to see in her eyes that strength of character which has enabled her to stand firm in the face of difficulties, and that compassion for all humanity which she has revealed to me so often.      I do not know what it is to see into the heart of a friend through that °ßwindow of the soul,°® the eye. I can only °ßsee°® through my finger tips the outline of a face. I can detect18 laughter, sorrow, and many other obvious emotions. I know my friends from the feel19 of their faces. But I cannot really picture their personalities through the thoughts they express to me, through whatever of their actions are revealed to me. I am denied that deeper understanding of them which I am sure would come through sight of them, through watching their reactions to various expressions and circumstances20, through noting the immediate and fleeting13 reactions of their eyes and countenance14.      How much easier, how much more satisfying it is for you who can see to grasp quickly the essential qualities of another person by watching the subtleties15 of expression, the quiver of a muscle, the flutter21 of a hand. But does it ever occur to you to use your sight to see the inner22 nature of a friend or acquaintance23? Do not most of you seeing people grasp casually the outward features of a face and let it go at that?      The eyes of seeing persons soon become accustomed to the routine of their surroundings24, and they actually see only the startling25 and spectacular26. But even in viewing the most spectacular sights the eyes are lazy. Some see more than others, but few see everything that is within the range27 of their vision.      I, who am blind, can give one hint28 to those who see: Use your eyes as if tomorrow you would be stricken blind. And the same method can be applied to other senses. Hear the music of voices and the song of a bird as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow. Touch each object you want to touch as if tomorrow your tactile16 sense would fail. Smell the perfume of flowers, taste each morsel17, as if tomorrow you could never smell and taste again. Make the most of every sense. But of all the senses, I am sure that sight must be the most delightful. 
Hurry Up or Slow Down? °ßThe race is not to the swift1 or the battle to the strong.°® (Eccl.1 9:11)       There was once a fellow2 who, with his dad, farmed a little piece of land. Several times a year they would load3 up the old ox4-drawn cart with vegetables and go into the nearest city to sell their produce5. Except for their name and the patch6 of ground, the father and son had little in common. The old man believed in taking it easy. The boy was usually in a hurry°Xthe go-getter2 type.      One morning, bright and early, they hitched3 up the ox to the loaded cart and started on the long journey. The son figured7 that if they moved faster and kept going all day and night, they°¶d make the market by early the next morning. So he kept prodding4 the ox with a stick, urging the beast to get a move on. °ßTake it easy, son,°® said the old man. °ßYou°¶ll last longer.°®      °ßBut if we get to the market ahead of the others, we°¶ll have a better chance of getting good prices,°® argued the son.      No reply. Dad just pulled his hat down over his eyes and fell asleep on the seat. Itchy8 and irritated, the young man kept goading5 the ox to walk faster. His stubborn9 pace10 refused to change.      Four hours and four miles down the road, they came to a little house. The father woke up, smiled, and said, °ßHere°¶s your uncle°¶s place. Let°¶s stop in and say hello.°®      °ßBut we°¶ve lost an hour already,°® complained the hotshot6.      °ßThen a few more minutes won°¶t matter. My brother and I live so close, yet we see each other so seldom,°® the father answered slowly.      The boy fidgeted7 and fumed11 while the two old men laughed and talked away almost an hour. On the move again, the man took his turn leading the ox. As they approached a fork12 in the road, the father led the ox to the right.      °ßThe left is the shorter way,°® said the son.      °ßI know it,°® replied the old man, °ßbut this way is so much prettier.°®      °ßHave you no respect for time?°® the young man asked impatiently.      °ßOh, I respect it very much! That°¶s why I like to use it to appreciate beauty and enjoy each moment to the fullest.°®      The winding13 path led through graceful14 meadows15, past wildflowers, and along a rippling16 stream°Xall of which the young man missed as he churned8 within17,  reoccupied18 and boiling with anxiety19.  He didn°¶t even notice how lovely the sunset was that day.      Twilight20 found them in what looked like a huge, colorful garden. The old man breathed in the aroma9, listened to the bubbling brook, and pulled the ox to a halt21. °ßLet°¶s sleep here,°® he sighed.       °ßThis is the last trip I°¶m taking with you,°® snapped22 his son. °ßYou°¶re more interested in watching sunsets and smelling flowers than in making money!°®      °ßWhy, that°¶s the nicest thing you°¶ve said in a long time,°® smiled the dad. A couple of minutes later he was snoring23°Xas his boy glared24 back at the stars. The night dragged25 slowly; the son was restless26.      Before sunrise the young man hurriedly shook his father awake. They hitched up and went on. About a mile down the road they happened upon another farmer°Xa total stranger°Xtrying to pull his cart out of a ditch27.      °ßLet°¶s give him a hand,°® whispered28 the old man.      °ßAnd lose more time?°® the boy exploded29.      °ßRelax, son ... You might be in a ditch sometime30 yourself. We need to help others in need°Xdon°¶t forget that.°® The boy looked away in anger.      It was almost eight o°¶clock that morning by the time the other cart was back on the road. Suddenly, a great flash31 split the sky. What sounded like thunder followed. Beyond the hills, the sky grew dark.      °ßLooks like a big rain in the city,°® said the old man.      °ßIf we had hurried, we°¶d be almost sold out by now,°® grumbled32 his son.      °ßTake it easy ... You°¶ll last longer. And you°¶ll enjoy life so much more,°® counseled33 the kind old gentleman.      It was late afternoon by the time they got to the hill overlooking the city. They stopped and stared down at it for a long, long time. Neither of them said a word. Finally, the young man put his hand on his father°¶s shoulder and said, °ßI see what you mean, Dad.°®      They turned their cart around and began to roll slowly away from what had once been the city of Hiroshima. 
I Want a Wife. °@°@The following essay quickly became a classic piece of feminist humor when it appeared in the premiere1 issue of Ms. magazine1. It has been widely circulated 2, reprinted, and discussed many times since then. The writer, Judy Brady2, points out in her essay just how convenient it is to have a wife. A wife, after all, is someone who will take care of your children, cook your food, clean and mend3 your clothes, entertain your friends, and so on. Certainly, anyone would want to have a wife. The only trouble is, who would want to be a wife? °@°@I belong to that classification4 of people known as wives. I am a Wife. And, not altogether incidentally5, I am a mother. °@°@Not too long ago a male friend of mine appeared on the scene fresh from a recent divorce. He had one child, who is, of course, with his ex-wife3. He is looking for another wife. As I thought about him while I was ironing6 one evening, it suddenly occurred to me that I, too, would like to have a wife. Why do I want a wife? °@°@I would like to go back to school so that I can become economically7 independent, support myself, and, if need be, support those dependent upon me. I want a wife who will work and send me to school. And while I am going to school I want a wife to take care of my children. I want a wife to keep track of the children°¶s doctor and dentist8 appointments9. And to keep track of mine, too. I want a wife to make sure my children eat properly10 and are kept clean. I want a wife who will wash the children°¶s clothes and keep them mended. I want a wife who is a good nurturant11 attendant to my children, who arranges for their schooling, makes sure that they have an adequate12 social life with their peers, takes them to the park, the zoo, etc. I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick, a wife who arranges to be around when the children need special care, because, of course, I cannot miss classes at school. My wife must arrange to lose time at work, and not lose the job. It may mean a small cut in my wife°¶s income from time to time, but I guess I can tolerate13 that. Needless to say, my wife will arrange and pay for the care of the children while my wife is working.  °@°@I want a wife who will take care of my physical needs. I want a wife who will keep my house clean. A wife who will pick up after my children, a wife who will pick up after me. I want a wife who will keep my clothes clean, ironed, mended, replaced when need be, and who will see to it that my personal things are kept in their proper place so that I can find what I need the minute I need it. I want a wife who cooks the meals, a wife who is a good cook. I want a wife who will plan the meals, do the necessary grocery14 shopping, prepare the meals, serve them pleasantly, and then do the cleaning up while I do my studying. I want a wife who will care for me when I am sick and sympathize with my pain and loss of time from school. I want a wife to go along when our family takes a vacation so that someone can continue to care for me and my children when I need a rest and change of scene.  °@°@I want a wife who will not bother15 me with rambling16 complaints about a wife°¶s duties. But I want a wife who will listen to me when I feel the need to explain a rather difficult point I have come across in my course of studies. And I want a wife who will type my papers for me when I have written them.  °@°@I want a wife who will take care of the details of my social life. When my wife and I are invited out by my friends, I want a wife who will take care of the babysitting17 arrangements. When I meet people at school that I like and want to entertain, I want a wife who will have the house clean, will prepare a special meal, serve it to me and my friends, and not interrupt when I talk about the things that interest me and my friends. I want a wife who will have arranged that the children are fed and ready for bed before my guests arrive so that the children do not bother us. I want a wife who takes care of the needs of my guests so that they feel comfortable, who makes sure that they have an ashtray18, that they are passed the hors d°¶oeuvres4, that they are offered a second helping19 of the food, that their wine glasses are replenished20 when necessary, that their coffee is served to them as they like it. And I want a wife who knows that sometimes I need a night out by myself.  °@°@If, by chance, I find another person more suitable21 as a wife than the wife I already have, I want the liberty to replace my present wife with another one. Naturally, I will expect a fresh, new life; my wife will take the children and be solely22 responsible for them so that I am left free. °@°@When I am through with school and have a job, I want my wife to quit working and remain at home so that my wife can more fully and completely take care of a wife°¶s duties. °@°@My God, who wouldn°¶t want a wife? 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄOnce upon a time, there was a king who had absolute power and a wild imagination. However, he didn‚Äôt kill his people at will like a barbarian. Instead, he had his own unique way to let his people see that ‚Äújustice‚Äù existed in his kingdom. When a subject was accused of a serious crime, all the people would assemble at a vast amphitheater* on a certain day. The accused man would then be brought to the center of the arena. Directly opposite him would be two doors that were exactly alike, side by side. Behind one would be a fair lady and behind the other would be a fierce tiger. The man on trial had to open one of the two doors and his choice would determine whether he was guilty or innocent.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen the door was opened, it might be the fierce tiger that sprang upon the man and tore him to pieces. This was considered proof of his guilt. Doleful bells would ring and the vast audience would walk slowly home with bowed heads. But it might also be a lady, who would give her hand to the man. The two would immediately be married in a grand ceremony to celebrate the man‚Äôs innocence. Brass bells would ring merrily and the people would be joyful. The innocent man, preceded by children strewing flowers along his path, would lead his bride home. Since the accused man was completely free to choose a door, the king considered this ‚Äújustice‚Äù instead of what we might call ‚Äúblind chance.‚Äù  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThis king had a daughter whose soul was as wild, passionate, and imperious as her father‚Äôs. She had taken a handsome young man as her secret lover. However, one day they were seen kissing each other. The man was immediately cast into prison, and soon came the day when he too had to appear for his ‚Äútrial‚Äù in the king‚Äôs arena. The most savage tiger to be found in the kingdom was brought there in a cage. And a young lady who was considered the most tender and beautiful in the kingdom was also summoned. Of course, everybody knew what the man had been accused of.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe day finally came and people swarmed into the amphitheater from far and wide. All was ready. The signal was given for the man to walk out. He bowed to the king but looked at the face of the princess, who sat to the right of her father. She must have known where the lady, or the tiger, hid.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe princess knew indeed. But how could she hold back her jealousy and allow a beautiful young woman to take her lover away right before her eyes? On the other hand, wouldn‚Äôt it be a thousand times more awful to watch him being torn apart by a ferocious wild beast?  „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen the man turned and looked up at her, his anxious glance asked the question: ‚ÄúWhich?‚Äù The princess raised her right hand and made a slight, quick movement toward the right. No one but her lover saw her hint. He turned, and with a firm and rapid step, walked across the empty space. Everyone held his breath and had his eyes fixed immovably on him. Without the slightest hesitation, he went to the door on the right and opened it.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄNow the question is this: Which came out of that door, the lady or the tiger?  
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄA symbol, simply put, is something that stands for something else. Usually, it is a material object used to represent something that is more abstract. If you look closely at the world around you, you will soon realize that symbols can be found almost everywhere. Traffic signs, banknotes*, or wedding rings are all common examples. Take a wedding ring for example. When used in a ceremony, this tiny piece of metal is no longer a decorative accessory but a symbol that signifies not only a lifelong and everlasting commitment but also unending love in marriage, as its circular shape may suggest. „ÄÄ„ÄÄBut when it comes to poetry, how do symbols work? A poem is a literary work where the most symbols are found in the shortest space. A symbol, as John Drury*, a contemporary American poet, once defined it, is ‚Äúan image that radiates meanings.‚Äù When an image or event is read as a symbol, it is given another layer of meaning beyond its literal one. What follows is a short poem by Robert Frost, ‚ÄúFire and Ice.‚Äù Before going on to its analysis, read it through and see if you can identify any images that serve as symbols. Fire and Ice Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. From what I‚Äôve tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate To say that for destruction ice Is also great And would suffice. ‚ÄîRobert FrostÔºà-Ôºâ‚Äî „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhat pictures come to mind when you run through the first two lines? Perhaps you see a dark image of the earth burning down to ashes, and then a globe frozen into ice. If you move on, you will see that the images of fire and ice refer to something more than just flaring flames or chilly ice. Paired with desire, the image of fire becomes symbolic of the burning greed that drives one to his or her destruction. On the other hand, linked with hate, the image of ice symbolizes the enmity* that leads people to fight deadly wars, or just keeps each of them isolated in a numb* state of existence, like a frozen world where nothing grows. Through these associated meanings, the two simple images are no longer inanimate natural phenomena but symbols of the destructive force of human emotions. „ÄÄ„ÄÄSymbols adding greater complexity to poetry, our reading experience of poems is thus enriched and poems can be interpreted differently. No symbols have absolute meanings; their sense can be determined by each reader‚Äôs culture and time. But it is also vital to make sure your understanding of the symbol is relevant to the whole context of the poem. Examine the two poems below, which explore the significance of a seemingly trivial incident in the speaker‚Äôs life. While reading, think about what the central event is in each poem and what it might symbolize. To a Daughter Leaving Home When I taught you at eight to ride a bicycle, loping* along beside you as you wobbled* away on two round wheels, my own mouth rounding in surprise when you pulled ahead down the curved path of the park, I kept waiting for the thud* of your crash as I sprinted to catch up, while you grew smaller, more breakable with distance, pumping, pumping for your life, screaming with laughter, the hair flapping behind you like a handkerchief waving goodbye. ‚ÄîLinda Pastan (--) ‚Äî The Road Not Taken Two roads diverged* in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth*; Then took the other, as just as fair And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that, the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: two roads diverged in a wood, and I‚Äî I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. ‚ÄîRobert Frost (-)‚Äî ‚ÄîWritten by Joseph Chen 
The Seven-Day Anti-procrastination Plan. °@°@Many students procrastinate, or put off, doing an assignment until the very last minute. Here are seven strategies you can use to eliminate procrastination. The suggestions are tied to the days of the week to help you remember them. Monday: Make It Meaningful     What is important about the job you've been putting off? List all the benefits of completing it. Look at it in relation to your goals. Be specific about the rewards for getting it done, including how you will feel when the task is completed. Tuesday: Take It Apart     Break a big job into a series of small ones you can do in fifteen minutes or less. If a long reading assignment intimidates you, divide it into two-page or three-page sections. Make a list of the sections and cross them off as you complete them so you can see your progress. Wednesday: Write an Intention Statement     Write an intention statement on an index card. For example, if you can't get started with your report on Beethoven, you might write, "I intend to find at least five articles about him by 9:00 p.m. I will reward myself with an hour of guilt-free recreational reading." Carry the card with you or post it in your study area where you will see it often. Thursday: Tell Everyone     Announce publicly your intention to get the job done. Tell a friend you plan to learn one hundred new English words a week, for example. Include anyone who will suggest ways to get it done. Make the world your support group. Friday: Find a Reward     You deserve a reward for accomplishing a task, but construct rewards carefully. Be willing to withhold them if you do not complete the task. Don't pick a movie as a reward for studying biology if you plan to go to the movie anyway. You might find that movies, new clothes, or an extra hour riding your bicycle are more fun when you've earned them. Saturday: Settle It Now     Do it now. The minute you notice yourself procrastinating, you should plunge into the task. Imagine yourself at a mountain lake, poised to dive in. Gradual immersion would be slow torture. Then be sure to savor the feeling of having the task behind you. Sunday: Say No     When you keep pushing a task into the low-priority category, re-examine the purpose for doing it at all. If you realize you really don't intend to do something, quit telling yourself that you will. That's procrastinating. Just say NO, and you don't have to carry around the baggage of an undone task.    If you are going to procrastinate, you can also choose not to. Consider the consequences of postponing. Recognizing the costs of procrastination may just help you kick the habit. Finally, ask yourself straight out if procrastination actually works in your favor. Some people really do thrive under pressure, and if you do your best work when you are pushing hard against an imminent deadline, you may be one of those people. 
Can Fashion Be Hazardous to Your Health? °@°@Just because something is popular, or fashionable, doesn't mean that it will be good for your health. Throughout history, whether in Western or Eastern countries, people have done unhealthy things to their bodies just to be fashionable. Even today there are many people who risk their health just to be in style.      In the sixteenth century, for example, white skin was the ideal, and many European women put white makeup on their faces to be in style. Unfortunately, the makeup they put on their faces was made with the poisonous metals such as lead and mercury. Used over a long period of time, the makeup could eventually remove layers of skin, cause teeth to fall out, and even poison people, leading to death. Some women were even willing to drink small amounts of the poison arsenic because it made them look fashionably pale. While many types of cosmetics are harmless, there are some that can be dangerous indeed.     Apart from misconceptions concerning the use of the cosmetics, the popularity of corsets in Europe also provided an opportunity for women to exchange health for beauty. A corset is a tight-fitting piece of clothing that a woman wore to change the shape of her body. Corsets were supposed to provide every woman with the tiny waist that was so fashionable at the time. Unfortunately, corsets were also known to break ribs, puncture lungs, cause indigestion, and bring on shortness of breath.      In ancient China, the practice of foot binding is another example of beauty at the price of health. In general, feet that were bound were two times smaller than normal feet. Foot binding involved a very painful procedure that usually began when a young girl was between the ages of three and six. During the procedure, the four smaller toes on each foot were broken and turned under, and the feet were wrapped tightly with a bandage. Each day, the bandage was tightened a little more to make the foot smaller and smaller. After several years, the child's feet were just eight to ten centimeters long, making it impossible for her to walk naturally. Moreover, the procedure itself was hazardous, with perhaps as many as 10 percent of the girls dying from infection or circulation problems caused by the tight bandages.       While the binding of feet might seem absurd to us today, women continue to do damage to their feet in the name of beauty. Wearing high heels, for example, shortens the muscles of the lower leg and can cause the back to arch unnaturally. This can lead to serious back problems and nerve damage. When ultra-high platform shoes were popular in Japan, police officers found that they were the major cause of many car accidents. They said that the thick soles of the shoes slowed the response time of drivers, especially when they had to brake in an emergency.      In some parts of the world, people are willing to pay for a procedure known as leg stretching just to become taller. This procedure involves breaking the leg bones and then slowly stretching the legs. The risks include nerve damage, bones becoming too weak to support the body, and uneven legs.       History is full of examples of extraordinary things people are willing to do in the name of fashion. Not even pain, medical complications, or the risk of death have discouraged people from trying to become more beautiful.  
Unit 3  The Earth°¶s Mysterious Neighbor. 	The night was quiet except for the sound of the wind in the trees and the crackle of the torches. Dozens of the village°¶s bravest hunters glanced around nervously as they walked through the gloomy forest. They were looking for the mysterious murderer that had killed five villagers during the last full moon. Over in the distance, a very large shadow began to move closer. As the clouds slipped past the full moon, the huge creature stood up on two legs, turned its head toward the moon, and began to howl like a wolf. 	The above is a common scene describing the appearance of a werewolf on the night of a full moon. In movies and in folklore, there are even more vivid accounts of how werewolves devour man after man, with blood dripping down their jaws. Not all lunar legends are as horrifying as the werewolf story, of course, but most of them claim that the moon makes people lose control and start to act bizarrely. During a full moon, according to some statistics, more murders and suicides occur, and even more cases of animal attack. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the British Houses of Parliament declared that those who lost their minds and acted °ßfunnily°® only during a full moon should not face harsh penalties. In other words, those who committed crimes during a full moon would not be punished severely, since it was the moon that had tempted them to break the law. Interestingly, this example serves to illustrate how the English word °ßlunatic°® comes from °ßluna,°® the Latin word for the moon. 	In fact, quite a few theories explain why serious incidents happen more frequently during a full moon than during the other phases of the moon. One common theory says that before electricity was discovered, it was difficult to see at night, so most people stayed home and went to bed early. However, the bright moonlight during a full moon enabled people to stay up engaging in more activities. The greater the number of people who stayed out late was, the higher the chance was that certain incidents would occur. Thus, stories about bad things happening during a full moon have accumulated over time, and people have made inferences about the negative influence that a full moon has on humans. 	Whether those legends are true or not, that the moon is important to life on our planet is undeniable. As the moon moves around the earth, its gravity creates tides on earth. Each time the moon exerts its gravitational force on the surface of the earth, this brings energy and food to the planet°¶s living creatures. For instance, crabs are able to find food in the intertidal zone while the tide is going out. In brief, tidal movements allow wetlands to sustain life. 	Moreover, scientists have discovered that the moon°¶s gravity keeps the earth stable. Were it not for the moon, the earth would °ßwobble°® on its axis, and different parts of the planet would point at the sun every year. Taiwan, for example, might be frozen like the North Pole one year and hotter than the Sahara the next. The climate would be in a terrible mess, not to mention the fact that people around the world would face a huge challenge of adapting themselves to the harsh weather conditions. 	Lacking much knowledge about the moon, ancient people created mysterious legends as well as rituals. They followed certain patterns of behavior according to the different phases of the moon. Today, with the rapid development of science and technology, we have been able to gain more accurate information about how the moon has constantly influenced us in various ways. It is not as unknown as it was to our ancestors, yet there are still many aspects of it waiting for us to explore. Maybe in another decade, we°¶ll be able to have a far deeper understanding of the moon, the earth°¶s mysterious neighbor. °XBy Robert Gouthro
°@°@°@Madame Oreille1 was a little woman of about forty, very economical, and with a very short temper1. It really pained her to see any money spent. Whenever she had to spend any, no matter how necessary it might be, she slept badly the next night. °@°@Her husband was one of the head clerks2 in the Ministry of Defense3. For two years he had always come to the office with the same old patched umbrella, to the great amusement of his fellow clerks. At last, he got tired of their jokes, and insisted upon his wife°¶s buying him a new one. °@°@She bought him one for eighteen francs, and said, getting red with anger as she gave it to her husband, °ßThis will last you for five years at least.°®  °@°@Mr. Oreille felt quite triumphant2, and received a small ovation4 at the office with his new acquisition3. °@But he had scarcely4 got home that evening when his wife took the umbrella from him, examined it, and nearly had a fit when she found it covered with small holes, just as if someone had emptied the ashes5 from a lighted pipe6 onto it. °@°@She threw the useless article7 at his head, screaming out in a violent rage. °@°@°ßOh! You did it on purpose. You shall not have another.°® °@°@Then she started one of those scenes, which makes a peaceable man dread8 his wife more than a battlefield where bullets9 are raining. After the storm had raged for an hour, a ring at the bell saved him.

The companies pay for all articles that are burned, as long as the damage has been done in your own house.°®  °@°@On hearing this advice, Madame Oreille calmed down immediately and said to her husband, °ßTomorrow, before going to your office, you°¶ll go to the insurance company and make them pay for the damage.°®  °@°@Mr. Oreille was very astonished at the proposal11. °@°@°ßI wouldn°¶t do it for my life! It°¶s eighteen francs lost. It won°¶t ruin us.°®  °@°@The next morning he took a walking stick5 when he went out. Luckily, it was a fine day. °@°@Left at home alone, Madame Oreille could not get over the loss of her eighteen francs by any means. °@°@Every moment she thought of the insurance company, she hesitated, for she was very timid12 when she had to speak to strangers. °@°@But the regret at the loss of the eighteen francs pained her as if she had been wounded13. So she said to herself: °@°@°ßI°¶ll go, and we°¶ll see what will happen.°®  °@°@But first of all she was obliged14 to prepare the umbrella so that the disaster might be complete. She took a match and burned a hole as big as the palm15 of her hand. Then she went out with the umbrella. °@°@After a short while, she got to the insurance company. She could not help noticing how her heart beat as she entered. She stopped a gentleman and said timidly:  °@°@°ßI beg your pardon16, but can you tell me where I must apply for payment for anything that has been accidentally burned?°®  °@°@He replied, °ßThe first door on the left.°®  °@°@She went there and knocked at the door. A clear voice said, in answer: °ßCome in!°® °@°@She obeyed mechanically17, and found herself in a large room where three solemn18 gentlemen were standing talking. °@°@One of them asked her, °ßWhat do you want?°®  °@°@She could scarcely4 speak but stammered19, °ßI have come¢wI have come on account of an accident¢w°®  °@°@ He very politely pointed out a seat to her.  °@°@°ßWhat can I do for you?°®  °@°@She could hardly get out her words, but at last she managed to say: °ßI have come for this.°®  °@°@The manager looked at the object that she held out to him in mute20 astonishment. °@°@°ßIt looks to me to be in a very bad state of health,°® he said compassionately. °@°@°ßIt cost me twenty francs,°® she said, with some hesitation. °@°@He seemed astonished. °ßReally! As much as that? But I really don°¶t understand what it has to do with me.°®  °@°@She began to feel uncomfortable; perhaps this company did not pay for such small articles, and she said: °@°@°ßBut¢wit°¶s burned.°®  °@°@He could not deny it. °@°@°ßI see that very well,°® he replied. °@°@She felt her courage reviving21. She was not going to give up without a struggle. She was not even afraid any more, and said: °@°@°ßI°¶m Madame Oreille; we°¶re insured by your company, and I°¶ve come to claim the value of this damage. I only want you to pay me the cost of re-covering22 it.°®  °@°@The gentleman seemed rather confused. °@°@°ßReally, it°¶s such a very small matter! We°¶re never asked to give compensation23 for such trivial24 losses.°®  °@°@She got red in the face, and felt inclined25 to fly into a rage. °@°@°ßYour company is supposed to compensate for ANYTHING burned in my house!°®  °@°@As he thought that he had no chance of getting rid of her, and that he would only be wasting his time, he said resignedly26, °ßWhat do you estimate the damage at?°® °@°@°ßWell, I don°¶t want to make any money out of you, so I°¶ll tell you what we°¶ll do. I°¶ll take my umbrella to the maker, who will re-cover it, and I°¶ll bring the bill to you. Will that suit you?°®  °@°@°ßPerfectly, we°¶ll settle it so. Here is a note for the cashier27, who will repay you whatever it costs you.°®  °@°@ He gave Madame Oreille a slip of paper; she took it, got up and went out, thanking him, for she was in a hurry to escape lest he should change his mind. °@°@ She went briskly28 through the streets, looking out for a really good umbrella maker, and when she found a shop, which appeared to be a first-class one, she went in, and said, confidently: °@°@°ßI want this umbrella re-covered in silk, good silk. Use the very best and strongest you have. I don°¶t mind what it costs.°® 
Unit 10 Have a Good Four Years. 	There is a popular notion that a college education is something to be endured in order to become certified to obtain certain kinds of jobs or to go to graduate school. This is not what we are trying to do at Harvard, nor would we wish to have many students here who took such a narrow view of a college career. 	There are several goals we aspire to reach in our undergraduate program. 	The most obvious one is to give knowledge¬°Xfairly concentrated knowledge in one field and a more general knowledge of a variety of other subject areas which you may choose according to your interest. But if acquiring knowledge is a self-evident part of a college education, it is far from the most important. Remarkably few of the facts you learn here will linger in your memory for many years, and some of those that do will be discredited by new knowledge. So if we were to concentrate on conveying information, we would give you something fleeting and impermanent. 	Instead, we have looked to other things we can give that will last a little longer. Among these things are certain habits of mind¬°Xthe capacity for more critical analysis, for more accurate and logical use of information, the ability to derive useful concepts and generalizations, to find and process data, and so forth. 	In addition to these methods of thought, it is our hope that we can instill certain attitudes of mind¬°Xa willingness to accept ambiguity, uncertainty, and the lack of definite truths; a sense of the complexity of human affairs and the variety of human experience that comes from history and literature; an independence of thought, and a respect for facts and for the disturbing conclusions to which facts sometimes lead. 	Beyond providing these intellectual qualities, a college education should try to lay a foundation for the creative use of leisure time. Some of this capacity can be stimulated in the classroom¬°Xin courses in the humanities and the arts. Yet, at least as much stimulation will occur outside the lecture hall¬°Xon athletic fields, in music rooms, student theaters, concert halls, and so on. 	These, then, are some of the aims of a liberal college education as I see them. I cannot resist concluding with a few private thoughts about our new careers at Harvard. 	To begin with, I hope that we will think broadly about what we want to achieve here. It would be tragic for you to set your sights on some limited goal, such as getting good grades or merely being admitted into one or another graduate school, just as it would be unfortunate for me to settle for simply preparing students to find decent, prosperous jobs. 	Second, I hope that you will give some thought to what you can do for others during your stay here. There are many problems waiting for your help, and many people who could profit from your efforts. Nothing can take the place of the contributions to be made by working directly with individuals whose problems are immediate and elemental. 	Third, I hope that we will all enjoy ourselves in the next few years. Even if we cannot¬°Xwhen we bear the inevitable anxieties, the frustrations, the bewilderment about ourselves and what we are accomplishing¬°XI hope that we will remember in one small corner of our minds that these moments of frustration and bewilderment are often indispensable to our well-being, for they are the spurs that push mind and spirit to some new and greater conception of ourselves and the world around us. 	Like all useful things, anxiety and frustration can be carried to excess, and this leads me to a final bit of advice. Whatever else we may do, let us remember not to take ourselves too seriously. However great our problems may seem, however urgent our complaints are, they are dwarfed by the predicament of countless other people on our planet. The world is filled with self-important, obsessive people. Let us not add to the number, lest we become too preoccupied to enjoy the opportunities around us, too self-indulgent to appreciate the needs of others, or too overcome with the weight of our responsibilities to meet them freely and creatively.
