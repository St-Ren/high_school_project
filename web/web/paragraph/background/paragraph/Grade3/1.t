Information Please.      When I was quite young, my family had one of the first telephones in our neighborhood. I remember well the polished1 oak case fastened2 to the wall on the lower stair landing1. The shiny receiver2 hung on the side of the box. I even remember the number°X105. I was too little to reach the telephone, but used to listen with fascination when my mother talked to it. Once she lifted me up to speak to my father, who was away on business. Magic!      Then I discovered that somewhere inside that wonderful device3 lived an amazing person°Xher name was °ßInformation Please°® and there was nothing she did not know. My mother could ask her for anybody°¶s number; when our clock ran down, Information Please immediately supplied the correct time.      My first personal experience with this genie3-in-the-receiver came one day while my mother was visiting a neighbor. Amusing myself at the tool-bench in the basement, I whacked4 my finger with a hammer5. The pain was terrible, but there didn°¶t seem to be much use crying because there was no one home to offer sympathy. I walked around the house sucking4 my throbbing6 finger, finally arriving at the stairway. The telephone! Quickly I ran for a footstool7 in the parlor5 and dragged it to the landing. Climbing up, I unhooked6 the receiver and held it to my ear. °ßInformation Please,°® I said into the mouthpiece8 just above my head.      A click7 or two, and a small, clear voice spoke into my ear. °ßInformation.°® °ßI hurt my fingerrr°X°® I wailed8 into the phone. The tears came readily enough, now that I had an audience.      °ßIsn°¶t your mother home?°® came the question.      °ßNobody°¶s home but me,°® I blubbered9.      °ßAre you bleeding?°®      °ßNo,°® I replied. °ßI hit it with the hammer and it hurts.°®      °ßCan you open your icebox10?°® she asked. I said I could.      °ßThen chip off a little piece of ice and hold it on your finger.      That will stop the hurt. Be careful when you use the ice pick11,°® she admonished9. °ßAnd don°¶t cry. You°¶ll be all right.°®      After that, I called Information Please for everything. I asked for help with my geography10 and she told me where Philadelphia12 was, and the Orinoco13°Xthe romantic river I was going to explore when I grew up. She helped me with my arithmetic11, and she told me that a pet chipmunk14°XI had caught him in the park just the day before°Xwould eat fruit and nuts15.      And there was the time that Petey, our pet canary16, died. I called Information Please and told her the sad story. She listened, then said the usual things grown-ups say to soothe12 a child. But I was unconsoled13. Why was it that birds should sing so beautifully and bring joy to whole families, only to end as a heap of feathers feet up, on the bottom of the cage?      She must have sensed my deep concern, for she said quietly, °ßPaul, always remember that there are other worlds to sing in.°®      Somehow I felt better.      Another day I was at the telephone. °ßInformation,°® said the now familiar voice.      °ßHow do you spell fix?°® I asked.       °ßFix something? F-I-X.°®      At that instant my sister, who took unholy14 joy in scaring me, jumped off the stairs at me with a banshee17 shriek15°X°ßYaaaaaaaaaa!°® I fell off the stool, pulling the receiver out of the box by its roots. We were both terrified°XInformation Please was no longer there, and I was not at all sure that I hadn°¶t hurt her when I pulled the receiver out.       Minutes later there was a man on the porch16. °ßI°¶m a telephone repairman17. I was working down the street and the operator18 said there might be some trouble at this number.°® He reached for the receiver in my hand. °ßWhat happened?°®      I told him.      °ßWell, we can fix that in a minute or two.°® He opened the telephone box, exposing a maze18 of wires19 and coils20, and fiddled21 for a while with the end of the receiver cord22, tightening things with a small screwdriver19. He jiggled20 the hook up and down a few times, and then spoke into the phone. °ßHi, this is Pete. Everything°¶s under control at 105. The kid°¶s sister scared him and he pulled the cord out of the box.°®      He hung up, smiled, gave me a pat on the head and walked out the door.      All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. Then, when I was nine years old, we moved across the country to Boston°Xand I missed my mentor23 acutely24. Information Please belonged in that old wooden box back home, and I somehow never thought of trying the tall, skinny new phone that sat on a small table in the hall.      Yet, as I grew into my teens, the memories of those childhood conversations never really left me; often in moments of doubt and perplexity25, I would recall26 the serene sense of security I had when I knew that I could call Information Please and get the right answer. I appreciated27 now how very patient, understanding and kind she was to have wasted her time on a little boy.      A few years later, on my way west to college, my plane stopped in Seattle21. I had  about half an hour between connections, and I spent 15 minutes or so on the phone with my sister, who lived there, now happily mellowed by marriage and motherhood. Then, really without thinking what I was doing, I dialed28 my hometown operator and said, °ßInformation Please.°®      Miraculously, I heard again the small, clear voice I knew so well: °ßInformation.°®      I hadn°¶t planned this, but I heard myself saying, °ßCould you tell me, please, how to spell the word °•fix°¶?°®      There was a long pause29. Then came the softly spoken answer. °ßI guess,°® said Information Please, °ßthat your finger must have healed30 by now °®      I laughed. °ßSo it°¶s really still you. I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during all that time ....°®      °ßI wonder,°® she replied, °ßif you know how much you meant to me. I never had any children, and I used to look forward to your calls. Silly, wasn°¶t it?°®      It didn°¶t seem silly, but I didn°¶t say so. Instead I told her how often I had thought of her over the years, and I asked if I could call her again when I came to visit my sister after the first semester was over.      °ßPlease do. Just ask for Sally.°®      °ßGood-bye, Sally.°® It sounded strange for Information Please to have a name. °ßIf I run into any chipmunks, I°¶ll tell them to eat fruit and nuts.°®      °ßDo that,°® she said. °ßAnd I expect one of these days you°¶ll be off for the Orinoco. Well, good-bye.°®      Just three months later I was back again at the Seattle airport. A different voice answered, °ßInformation,°® and I asked for Sally.      °ßAre you a friend?°®      °ßYes,°® I said. °ßAn old friend.°®      °ßThen I°¶m sorry to have to tell you. Sally had only been working part-time in the last few years because she was ill. She died five weeks ago.°® But before I could hang up, she said, °ßWait a minute. Did you say your name was Villiard22?°®      °ßYes.°®      °ßWell, Sally left a message for you. She wrote it down.°®      °ßWhat was it?°® I asked, almost knowing in advance what it would be.      °ßHere it is, I°¶ll read it°X°•Tell him I still say there are other worlds to sing in. He°¶ll know what I mean.°¶°®      I thanked her and hung up. I did know what Sally meant. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄCleanliness is commonly considered a virtue, but just what does it mean to be clean? One person‚Äôs definition can be quite different from another‚Äôs, but cleanliness basically means being free of dirt and germs. Bathing, in particular, is considered one of the simplest ways to achieve cleanliness. Throughout the ages, our perception of bathing as well as our bathing habits has undergone huge changes. Sometimes bathing is popular; sometimes it‚Äôs not. Influenced greatly by religion, economy and technology, bathing has certainly come a long way to become what we are used to today. „ÄÄ„ÄÄArchaeological* evidence suggests that bathing is as old as the first civilizations. A soap-like material, which dates back to about 2 B.C., has been found in clay jars of Babylonian* origin. It was a mix of fats and ashes. But no one in history has indulged in bathing like the Romans did. Supplied with water from the aqueducts*, nearly a dozen large and magnificent public bathhouses dotted the city of Rome. Hundreds more have been found in the Roman manors*. The Romans took bathing more as a leisure-time sport than a hygienic* practice. First, a bather would enter a warm room to sweat while enjoying lengthy conversations. Oil and sand would be rubbed against the skin to cleanse it. Next came a hot room where the heavily perspiring* bather would be treated to water-splashing, more oil and scraping, and yet more talk. The final touch would be a plunge into a cool and refreshing pool. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn the early years of bathing in Rome, men and women had separate areas, but eventually the sexes were combined and the baths took on a less virtuous purpose. So corrupt had the Roman baths and the whole Roman society become that the fathers of the early Christian* church discouraged bathing. Clergymen* all over Europe frowned on bathing because they disapproved of nakedness; the public baths were considered centers of immorality and thus outlawed in many localities*. As a result, to such an extent were people‚Äôs hygienic practices repressed that Europe during the Middle Ages has been said to have gone through ‚Äúa thousand years without a bath.‚Äù Queen Isabella* of Castile* boasted that she had bathed only twice in her life‚Äîat birth and before her marriage. „ÄÄ„ÄÄReligion, however, wasn‚Äôt the only reason why Europeans didn‚Äôt bathe. Because the rivers were polluted, there was no running water, and the soap was taxed as a luxury item, the ordinary citizen had little opportunity to bathe. There was also the misconception among doctors that bathing in warm or hot water would open one‚Äôs pores* to diseases. Little did they know that it was, in fact, people‚Äôs poor bathing habits and unsanitary living conditions that largely contributed to the great plagues of the Middle Ages. For the next few hundred years, people continued to live without any bathing facilities. Early Americans, being of European origin, also brought their dirty habits with them. „ÄÄ„ÄÄBy the 1s, it became increasingly known that filth* led to diseases, and scholars began to argue that frequent bathing led to better health. As a result, both Europeans and Americans began reforming their unhygienic ways. Governments began to improve sanitation standards and many bathhouses were built as a result. Later, tubs, water heaters and good indoor plumbing made bathing accessible to ordinary citizens. Now most people bathe on a daily basis, and Americans like it so much that the average person in the USA claims to shower or bathe more than once each day. „ÄÄ„ÄÄLooking back in history, we can see that there have been very different views of bathing, and that cleanliness has not always been the top priority as it is nowadays. It seems natural or even vital for us to shower daily. Nevertheless, could it be possible that, in five hundred years, our current bathing habits may appear overly fastidious*? Whether we bathe twice a day or twice in our entire life, people‚Äôs bathing habits will surely undergo more changes in the years to come. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄIf the Earth were a single state, Istanbul would be its capital. ‚ÄîNapoleon Bonaparte* „ÄÄ„ÄÄNapoleon, who once ruled France as emperor, was fiercely proud of his French homeland. Therefore it might seem surprising that he would suggest a city in Turkey* rather than France to be a global capital. But Istanbul is no ordinary city. Throughout history, it has stood virtually at the crossroads of the world, and its charming culture has been influenced by some of the Earth‚Äôs most powerful civilizations. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIstanbul is split in two by the Bosphorus*. On one side of the channel, the city is in Europe, but on the other, it‚Äôs very much in Asia, meaning that Istanbul is a place where East literally meets West. Overland routes between Europe and Asia pass through Istanbul, and the city has links to both the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea*. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIstanbul‚Äôs unique geographical location means that it has always been a center for international trade. Historically, it was a major city at the western end of the legendary Silk Road*. This ancient trading route linked China with Europe, Africa, and the rest of Asia. It was used to transport Chinese products, including porcelain, paper, gunpowder, and of course silk, to the West. Moving in the opposite direction, spices, jewelry, leather, and rare plants and animals went through Istanbul on their way to the East. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIstanbul‚Äôs singular* location also made it attractive as a political center. Three great empires‚Äîthe Roman, Byzantine*, and Ottoman*‚Äîchose Istanbul as their capital. As successive empires fought to gain control of the city, it was repeatedly ravaged. Fortunately, Istanbul‚Äôs new rulers spared no expense in their rebuilding efforts. They also brought their traditions and religious beliefs, which included Islam* and Christianity*. As cultural diversity increased in Istanbul, so did cross-cultural exchanges, and churches and mosques* can now be found side by side in the city. „ÄÄ„ÄÄHagia Sophia* is a beautiful example of how different cultural elements have been blended together in one building. Originally built as a Christian church in the 4th century, it was converted into a mosque by Ottoman Turks* when they took over Istanbul in the late 1th century. The new Muslim rulers replaced Christian ceremonial objects with their own and whitewashed* the Christianity-themed mosaics*. However, they didn‚Äôt change the structure or outer appearance of the building. In the 1s, Hagia Sophia was changed into a museum, and some of the whitewash on the walls was washed and scrubbed away to reveal the mosaics underneath. The art and symbolism of two major religions can now be seen in this sublime edifice. „ÄÄ„ÄÄFacing Hagia Sophia is Sultan Ahmed Mosque*, known as the Blue Mosque because of the blue tiles that decorate its interior. This mosque is a fine example of traditional Islamic* architecture, as it has minarets*, prayer niches, and central fountains. But it also incorporates some of the Byzantine elements of the neighboring Hagia Sophia, including mosaics, domes, and the lavish use of marble. During his visit to the Blue Mosque in 2, Pope Benedict XVI* said, ‚ÄúMay all believers bear witness to true brotherhood.‚Äù He also expressed his hope that Turkey ‚Äúwill be a bridge of friendship and collaboration between East and West.‚Äù „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn the 2st century, the era of the global village, Istanbul has lost some of its geopolitical* significance, but it is still the third largest metropolitan area in Europe and one of the most important tourist spots in Turkey. The immense charm of the city lies in its exotic atmosphere, created through many centuries of cultural and religious confrontations, compromises, and fusions. There may be a lot of global cities nowadays, but Istanbul will always have its special place because of its unique history. 
The Seven-Day Anti-procrastination Plan. °@°@Many students procrastinate, or put off, doing an assignment until the very last minute. Here are seven strategies you can use to eliminate procrastination. The suggestions are tied to the days of the week to help you remember them. Monday: Make It Meaningful     What is important about the job you've been putting off? List all the benefits of completing it. Look at it in relation to your goals. Be specific about the rewards for getting it done, including how you will feel when the task is completed. Tuesday: Take It Apart     Break a big job into a series of small ones you can do in fifteen minutes or less. If a long reading assignment intimidates you, divide it into two-page or three-page sections. Make a list of the sections and cross them off as you complete them so you can see your progress. Wednesday: Write an Intention Statement     Write an intention statement on an index card. For example, if you can't get started with your report on Beethoven, you might write, "I intend to find at least five articles about him by 9:00 p.m. I will reward myself with an hour of guilt-free recreational reading." Carry the card with you or post it in your study area where you will see it often. Thursday: Tell Everyone     Announce publicly your intention to get the job done. Tell a friend you plan to learn one hundred new English words a week, for example. Include anyone who will suggest ways to get it done. Make the world your support group. Friday: Find a Reward     You deserve a reward for accomplishing a task, but construct rewards carefully. Be willing to withhold them if you do not complete the task. Don't pick a movie as a reward for studying biology if you plan to go to the movie anyway. You might find that movies, new clothes, or an extra hour riding your bicycle are more fun when you've earned them. Saturday: Settle It Now     Do it now. The minute you notice yourself procrastinating, you should plunge into the task. Imagine yourself at a mountain lake, poised to dive in. Gradual immersion would be slow torture. Then be sure to savor the feeling of having the task behind you. Sunday: Say No     When you keep pushing a task into the low-priority category, re-examine the purpose for doing it at all. If you realize you really don't intend to do something, quit telling yourself that you will. That's procrastinating. Just say NO, and you don't have to carry around the baggage of an undone task.    If you are going to procrastinate, you can also choose not to. Consider the consequences of postponing. Recognizing the costs of procrastination may just help you kick the habit. Finally, ask yourself straight out if procrastination actually works in your favor. Some people really do thrive under pressure, and if you do your best work when you are pushing hard against an imminent deadline, you may be one of those people. 
Yellowstone Wolves Make a Comeback. °@°@The American Northwest°¶s grey wolf population had already been decreasing for many years when, in 1872, chunks of three northwestern states were joined to form Yellowstone National Park, which comprises a territory of almost nine thousand square kilometers. However, the founding of the national park hardly let the poor wolves off the hook. In the beginning, people were still as free as ever to shoot any wild animals they came across, and grey wolves remained a popular target since they were often considered hazardous to livestock and humans. By 1926, Yellowstone°¶s grey wolves had been wiped out. °@°@In the following decades, however, it became clear that the ecological balance of the region had been disrupted by the loss of this species. The wolves had preyed upon elk and other large plant-eating animals; without the wolves, these animals rapidly increased in number. Elk have a weird habit of gnawing the bark of young trees near rivers, leaving the riverside with fewer and fewer trees. Beavers depend on trees for food and for building dams, which help to create streams, ponds, and lakes, weaving an intricate web of life for bugs, fish, birds, and plants. So, with elk gnawing away too many trees, the beavers started to die out, the land began to dry up, and an ecosystem came apart at the seams. °@°@Because of this, biologists and environmentalists began to call for the return of the grey wolf, and the campaign to reintroduce the grey wolf to Yellowstone Park began in earnest in the 1940s. It became legal with the Endangered Species Act of 1973. In March 1995, fourteen grey wolves captured in Canada were released into the park, after spending several weeks adapting to this somewhat more civilized life by living in specially constructed pens. Another seventeen wolves were brought in the following year, and ever since then, the grey wolves have reestablished themselves in Yellowstone. °@°@But do the wolves persist in their old bad habit of eating livestock? Of course they do, because you can°¶t teach an old wolf new tricks. With Yellowstone°¶s increasing wolf population, there have been hundreds of reports of livestock killings. Despite a compensation fund set up to reimburse those who lose their livestock to wolves, the ranchers and farmers continue to argue against the presence of wolves. Many wish that their meek, innocent sheep could live in peace rather than in constant fear of the wolves. Nevertheless, the truth is that most of the Yellowstone wolves pay no attention to livestock, except for a few rogue wolf packs. Like gangs with a howl, these are the villains that need to be hunted down or relocated. °@°@The good news is that the wolves have been doing what people were counting on them to do. The Yellowstone elk population has shrunk by over 50 percent. The riverbanks have become lively with lush trees, which are filled to the brim with happily chirping birds. The beavers can put their teeth back into action biting the wood and building dams, which means more wetland habitats for other species. Water keeps the land green and is essential to every form of life. Bears, wolverines, eagles, and ravens all thrive on the wolves°¶ leftovers as well as the remains of dead wolves. Little did biologists realize that the entire forest would benefit from the reintroduction of the grey wolf, down to the soil on the forest floor. °@°@What°¶s intriguing is that the wolves, which often appear to be villains, have turned out to be the indispensable heroes of this ecological play. They do not eliminate any animal populations, but rather keep some of them in check, which actually promotes the survival of many more species. If there were no wolves, the ecological balance of the park would definitely be upset. Yellowstone°¶s wolf population is now estimated at only two to three hundred, yet stubborn ranchers and farmers are still fuming about the wolves and want to make wolf hunting, even in the park, legal once again. However, we must support these seemingly fierce but actually vulnerable animals, so that for many years to come, we can go out on a peaceful night in Yellowstone and hear a chorus of animal sounds, including the grey wolves howling at the moon. 
°@Drug lords1, millionaire wannabes2, and the North Korean3 government have perfected methods to make knockoffs4 of U.S. dollar bills.  Now the scientists in charge of making the real dough5 are f?ighting back with an anti-counterfeiting6 $100 bill. °@°@ Every single American bank note is printed at Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP7) facilities1.  There is only one factory in the world printing U.S. dollars, but there is at least $70 million worth of fake U.S. currency floating around, of which 75 percent is in $100 bills.  Largely because of the introduction of inexpensive2 scanners3 and printers6, more and more fake bills are entering circulation: From 1997 to 2007, the amount of passed counterfeit6 bills nearly doubled, to $64.9 million.  Professional fakers are making bills that are more convincing than ever. °@°@°ßBlame the digital revolution. In the early 1990s, only 1 percent of all counterfeit currency was created with high-quality printers, scanners, and copiers5,°® says Michael Merritt8, a deputy6 assistant director for the Secret Service9, which is in charge of policing7 counterfeit currency. °ßNow it°¶s 56 percent, however.°®  One notable8 offender is Art Williams, Jr10., who has been arrested twice in the past decade for printing roughly $10 million in fake American currency using a scanner and a high-quality printer. °@°@The Secret Service estimates that 75 percent of the $564 billion in counterfeit US$100 bills are circulating overseas9. Because of its high prof?ile10 and constant known value, the American hundred has become the real currency in many unstable11 economies. However, tracking down fakes all over the world is too diff?icult for one agency. In addition, there are far more evil counterfeiters6 and opportunists12 than millionaire wannabes like Williams. For at least the past two decades, North Korea3 has been using the same sophisticated13 money-printing process as the U.S. to create a °ßsuperdollar11°®¢w a bill that matches nearly every one of its security features¢w in order to simultaneously14 fatten12 the country°¶s national funds and devalue15 the American dollar at the same time. (According to the Secret Service, $5.3 million in superdollars were passed in 2005, all as $100 bills.) °@°@Although most of the American financial brain trust13 is working extensive16 hours to digitize17 your dough, the BEP is working to protect with a combination of tricks18 in anti-counterfeiting tech19. Once the new bill hits ATMs20 in the next few years, even the smartest counterfeiters will be forced to start from square one. 
Unit 1 Dreams for the Future. 	Whenever I recall my childhood years, a smile would appear on my face. My friends and I would spend hours playing in the playground, and sometimes, we would speculate about what we wanted to be when we grew up. I had my heart set on becoming a movie star, and my friends contemplated becoming scientists, doctors, and enterprisers in the future. I used to reckon that every child had big dreams, but after watching the documentary film entitled Children of the World about children from various countries, I realized that not all children lead a carefree life as we do. 	In fact, some poor children can°¶t even pay attention to their schoolwork because they need to slave away for hours at difficult jobs. For example, the film shows a boy in Bolivia who has to work long hours in a coal mine so that he can pay his tuition. In another section, the film also covers a story of a group of kids in Tibet. Up in the mountains, they are isolated from the rest of the world, without any access to the Internet. These Tibetan children°¶s goals are worlds apart from those of Taiwanese children. They spend a lot of time meditating every day and hope to penetrate the meaning of life. 	However, out of all the children featured in this film, a youngster named Sandeep Shahani impressed me the most. Sandeep is from India. He is only about twelve years old, and he grows up in difficult circumstances. In the Indian language, his family name literally means °ßboatman.°® When asked about his future, Sandeep says that the only thing he intends to do is to follow in his father°¶s footsteps and become a boatman. Sandeep works around the clock, rowing passengers across the river for a trifling sum°Xperhaps NT$2 or NT$3 per trip. To me, it seems that he leads a miserable life. Since he makes so little money, he is likely to stay in his hometown all his life, and he will probably never get the chance to see the world. 	Later, I learned that the caste system may be the main reason why Sandeep doesn°¶t hold out much hope of working in a different occupation. The caste system is a system in India that classifies people into groups depending on which family they are born into, and it has existed for centuries. Sandeep may find some consolation in the fact that he is not a member of the lowest class, in which people are destined for an even harsher life full of inequality and mistreatment. Life is so despicable for them that they cannot imagine ever being treated fairly, let alone in a respectable way. 	Watching this film and seeing how Sandeep and other children live made me feel fortunate for all the things I have. Living such difficult lives, these children seem to stand no chance of dreaming big. For them, doing so would be nothing more than building castles in the air. Their dreams, in fact, can be deemed ordinary or insignificant by some people. Nevertheless, these children have made repeated attempts to fulfill their dreams. I couldn°¶t but appreciate how fantastic these children are. The fact that they work hard and try their best even though they are living under unfavorable circumstances serves as an incentive for me to follow through with my own dreams. It has dawned on me that it doesn°¶t matter whether our dreams are big or small as long as we don°¶t set a limit on ourselves. There is always a possibility of achieving our dreams. °XBy Jamie M.
