Can Animals Think? °@°@Can animals really think? Can they make decisions based on information? For years, scientists have debated1 these questions. Now, many of them believe that some animals have the brain power to understand new situations, make decisions, and plan ahead. The following are just a few of the many examples of animal intelligence that scientists have observed. °@°@Dandy1 is a young male chimpanzee2 at the Wisconsin Regional Primate Center2. Recently, he did something that surprised scientists there. The scientists had buried some grapefruit3 in the sand. Dandy knew where the grapefruit was, but when the other chimps were in the area, he pretended that he did not know the location. Later, when the other chimps fell asleep, he went right to the spot4 where the grapefruit was hidden, dug it up, and ate it. Amazingly5, Dandy was able to plan ahead and trick his friends. °@°@A green-backed female heron3 in Japan also did something surprising. She invented a new, creative way to get her food. When she saw some minnows4 swimming around in a pond6, she came up with a way to catch them. First, she found a twig and broke it into small pieces. Then, she took it to the pond and put it in the water. She even moved it to a place in the pond where it would attract the minnows. Finally, when the minnows swam over to the twig, she was able to catch one for her lunch. This shows how the heron was able to make use of a tool. °@°@At the University of Arizona5, a gray parrot7 named Alex6 surprised his trainer, Irene Pepperberg7. She has been working with Alex for 15 years, teaching him to talk, to name and count objects, and to answer simple questions about them. He is very good at these tasks8. He even says, °ßI°¶m sorry°® when he makes a mistake answering a question. But what Alex once did outside of the laboratory9 was even more impressive. When he had to go to the veterinarian°¶s office for lung10 surgery, he became upset11. As Pepperberg started to leave, Alex said, °ßCome here. I love you. I°¶m sorry. I want to go back.°® It seems that Alex either thought he was being punished for doing something wrong, or simply felt afraid. In either case, his trainer couldn°¶t help but think that Alex had learned to use language to express his thoughts. °@°@A gorilla12 named Timmy8, who had lived alone for most of his life, provided another unusual example of animal behavior. Timmy was brought to the Bronx9 Zoo in New York to mate with Pattycake10, a female gorilla who lived at the zoo. After their baby was born, it became sick and the mother and baby were taken away. The head of the zoo reported that Timmy became very upset when they left. He would neither eat nor sleep. He even cried. He looked everywhere to see if Pattycake had returned. It certainly seemed like he had fallen in love. °@°@In Italy11, scientists showed that an octopus could learn how to perform a task by watching another octopus do it. In this experiment, an octopus who did not know how to open a jar to get to a crab13 inside was allowed to watch another octopus who did know how. After observing how the second octopus did it, the first octopus was able to open the jar himself. Until recently, many scientists had thought that only mammals14 could learn by watching others. °@°@Stories like these raise many questions about animals and the way they think and behave. It seems that animals are capable of more than just processing information like a robot. Perhaps their behavior is the result of more than just instinct15 and memorized rules. Based on these observations, more scientists are concluding16 that animals really can think. What do you think? 
I Have a Dream. °@°@I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration1 for freedom in the history of our nation. °@°@Five score1 years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic2 shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation2. This momentous3 decree4 came as a great beacon5 light of hope to millions of Negro6 slaves3. It came as a joyous daybreak7 to end the long night of captivity4. °@°@But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. So we have come here today to dramatize5 a shameful6 condition.  °@°@In a sense we have come to our nation°¶s capital to cash a check. When the architects7 of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution8 and the Declaration of Independence8, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed9 the °ßinalienable10 rights of life, liberty11, and the pursuit of happiness.°® Instead of honoring this sacred12 obligation13, America has given the Negro people a bad check which has come back marked °ßinsufficient14 funds15.°®  °@°@But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults9 of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches16 of freedom and the security of justice. °@°@Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy17. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate18 valley19 of segregation20 to the sunlit10 path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands11 of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood21. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God°¶s children. °@°@I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. °@°@I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed22: °ßWe hold these truths to be self-evident23: that all men are created equal.°® °@°@I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. °@°@I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state sweltering24 with the heat of injustice and oppression25, will be transformed into an oasis12 of freedom and justice. °@°@I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged26 by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. °@°@I have a dream today. °@°@I have a dream that one day down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. °@°@I have a dream today. °@°@I have a dream that one day °ßevery valley shall be exalted13, and every hill and mountain shall be made low; the rough places will be made plain27 and the crooked28 places will be made straight; and the glory29 of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh30 shall see it together.°® °@°@This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew14 out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling31 discords32 of our nation into a beautiful symphony33 of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day. °@°@This will be the day when all of God°¶s children will be able to sing with a new meaning: My country, °¶tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, Land of the pilgrims°¶34 pride, From every mountainside Let freedom ring! °@°@And if America is to be a great nation this must become true. °@°@When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet15, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God°¶s children, black men and white men, Jews16 and Gentiles17, Protestants18 and Catholics19, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual35: °@°@Free at last! Free at last! °@°@Thank God Almighty20, we are free at last! °Xexcerpted from °ßI Have a Dream°® by Martin Luther King 
The Tiny World of the Future. °@°@What do you think the following products might have in common: a pair of stain-resistant1 pants, a type of sun cream2, and an iPod3? The answer is that all of them, to some degree, have been manufactured1 with the help of nanotechnology4. Some clothing fabrics5 have been coated2 with tiny fibers that prevent dirt from getting through to the lower layers of the material. Some brands of sunscreen6 use nanotechnology in a similar way to block out harmful ultraviolet rays7. And the displays on iPods, as well as some cellphones, laptops, and flat screen TVs, are made from plastic films built on the nanoscale8. °@°@So what exactly is the nanoscale? You may have seen amazing photographs taken through microscopes9 of things like hairs and bacteria10. These photos are on a scale just millionths of a meter in width. The nanoscale is at an even smaller level. °ßNano°® means °ßbillionth,°® so the nanoscale is a billion times smaller than the world of meters and kilometers that we live in. To compare measurements3, a 180-centimeter-tall man is 1.8 billion nanometers tall. A typical atom is around 0.1 nanometers in size. Therefore, operating on the nanoscale involves working with and manipulating4 atoms to create new things at the molecular level. °@°@One exciting example of nanotechnology is the development of carbon nanotubes11. These are rod-shaped carbon molecules that are about one nanometer across. They are bonded5 together in a dense structure that makes them very strong, stronger than steel. Nanotubes can, in theory, be made into materials of any length. Recently, NASA scientists suggested carbon nanotubes could be used to make a gigantic6 elevator stretching all the way from Earth into space. Though such applications lie in the future, nanotubes have already been used in such things as tennis rackets12 and bicycles, making them stronger without making them heavier.     Researchers are also hopeful about the potential of nanotechnology in the field of medicine. It is thought that tiny machines called nanobots will be able to move around inside the human body, detecting health problems such as cancer and transmitting7 information about them. For the time being, however, there are too many problems in designing a machine that can zoom8 through the bloodstream13, so medical nanobots remain in the realm9 of science fiction.     As the benefits10 of nanotechnology become clearer, some scientists are sounding a note of caution. They are concerned that nanoscale objects might cause harm to the environment and living things. Tiny particles, for instance, can become toxic11 to the human body. It has been pointed out that all chemical fertilizers12 were considered safe when first used, and the harmful effects of some were discovered only decades later. Nobody really knows whether new nanosubstances14 might have the same potential for danger. Careful research is needed to prevent the dream of a nanotech15 world from turning into a nano-nightmare. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄWhat was your life like when you were a child? How much do you enjoy your life now as a teenager? Xin-ling Shen*, an ordinary Taiwanese girl, has created many more opportunities for others since she was a fourth grader through generosity and sheer determination. „ÄÄ„ÄÄBorn into an impoverished family, Shen was forced to travel around the island constantly with her parents, who earned a living as night market vendors in different cities. Because of her family‚Äôs unstable lifestyle, she never had the chance to go to preschool. However, she made good use of every learning opportunity, such as learning words from shop signs she saw on the road. When she became a fourth grader, she developed an interest in computers. Even though her parents could barely make both ends meet, her mother sold her exquisite jade bracelet to buy Shen a computer.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄShen turned out to be a computer whiz, acquiring vital computer skills by reading computer books in bookstores for hours every day. She learned to set up her own website at the age of twelve in order to help her parents sell clothes online. Then she devised an online system to help farmers promote their pomelos*. At that time, this was an innovative form of farm produce marketing in Taiwan. Later, numerous companies paid Shen to design their web pages. By the time she was fourteen, she had accumulated NT$ million on her own. „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhat would you do with this sum of money? Keeping all the money for herself was the last thing Shen wanted to do. With her parents‚Äô encouragement, Shen gave it all to charity. She developed the website ananedu.com so that children, especially poor children, could learn all their school subjects online for free. Over three million people have visited this website. First designed to serve students on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the website later had a Cambodian* version added to it. More amazingly, Shen even hosted a free summer English camp for children from disadvantaged families, all on her own. She planned the summer camp, looked for appropriate venues, and invited teachers. She even had to visit underprivileged families in person to convince the parents to send their children to the camp. Such tasks could easily overwhelm an average fourteen-year-old girl. The hardships, however, did not deter Shen because she wanted to give children the educational rights they had been deprived of due to poverty. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn addition to her dedication to education, Shen has always been concerned about the grassroots* society in Taiwan. She has developed her photography skills by taking photos of those who are economically disadvantaged. She uses such images to remind the rest of the society of the contributions and the basic dignity of the poor. So far, she has taken more than 2, pictures, and has added her own footnotes to each of them. Her touching photographs were on display in Beijing* during the 2 summer Olympics*. „ÄÄ„ÄÄShen never seems to lack ideas for making more contributions to the society. She has been described as an angel to the underprivileged. Shen has set a good example for us, and it is important that all of us make the best use of our own talents to help make Taiwan a better place to live in.  
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄRemember the times when Mom or Dad would cuddle up to you at bedtime and read a bedtime story to you? I can still remember the comforting weight of the book on my lap and the sound of turning the pages, as my mother uncovered a new world for me. Imagine how it would feel if this crinkle* of crisp pages were replaced by the small screen of an e-book reader. „ÄÄ„ÄÄE-books are books that can be read through an electronic medium. In other words, these books are not on paper; they are read digitally on a computer, laptop, or e-reader*. Many people feel that the e-book is the greatest innovation in the literary world. E-books were not as popular in the earlier 1s; however, thanks to high-speed portable reading devices where thousands of books can be stored, people have slowly started taking an interest in e-books. As a matter of fact, in July 2, Amazon.com* reported that more e-books were sold than hardcovers*. Keeping this new technology‚Äôs popularity in mind, Google also launched Google eBooks in 2. Through this service, all the books that Google has scanned, converted to text, and stored in its digital database* can be viewed and searched. With such a service, the traditional hardcover book may soon be a thing of the past.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄMany favor the e-book, as it has several advantages over a paper book (or p-book). An e-book reader is light and portable. It is the same size as a regular p-book, but the contents of thousands of e-books can be stored in one small reader. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if we could carry thousands of books in a small hardware device in our pocket? Although e-readers can be a little costly, e-books are more economical in the long run. It is cheaper to buy a thousand e-books than to buy a thousand hardcover books. Most readers also love the fact that the contents of the e-reader can be ‚Äúsearched‚Äù and books belonging to the same category can be recommended automatically. Also, people can easily bookmark a page or a line and come back to the same exact spot when they begin to read again. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIn spite of the advantages an e-book may boast, some people feel that reading a hardcover book is not solely an intellectual pursuit but an emotional and spiritual one as well. Most of us have been raised to believe that books are so valuable that they need to be cherished and respected. We all have at least a few books that may not be antiques, but still hold a special place in our heart. Some books have a cloth-case wrap* or a leatherette* or a foil-stamped* cover.  Others have heavier paper or better binding. These distinctive features make them worth collecting. Moreover, no matter how many years pass, these old friends still give us the familiar comfort of turning each page and writing notes in the margin‚Äîa sentiment you will never experience with an e-book.      All said and done, most readers are of the opinion that ‚Äúhow you read‚Äù is not as important as ‚Äúwill you read.‚Äù E-book owners find it more convenient to read now because they don‚Äôt need to look for books in stores or libraries. P-book readers‚Äô sentiment, on the contrary, represents another idea of how books should be. As James H. Billington*, the librarian of Congress, said, the new immigrants don‚Äôt shoot the old inhabitants when they come in; they all learn to live together. So, whether you choose to read a p-book or an e-book shouldn‚Äôt matter so much. After all, the essence of a book lies in its content rather than its form.  
You Raise Me Up.      Life is not always a bed of roses. There are times when everything in your life goes smoothly, and you regard yourself as the luckiest person in the world. You have everything you desire, and everything seems to be going your way. However, things can change all at once. Suddenly, the situation is not as rosy as it was before, and then trouble emerges. If you are a pessimist, you may feel your friends will all betray you, the world being against you.      The reality of life is that at times things will seem discouraging, but it is absolutely not the end of the world. As was voiced by Martin Luther King, Jr., "Let us not wallow in the valley of despair." We need to struggle out of our despair and confront our fate with perseverance and a positive attitude. There are definitely ways to get rid of the dismay from our dreary days if we choose to remain optimistic. For example, every student has something to worry about, like an exam result being one notch lower than expected, or a misunderstanding with friends that is tough to handle. However, all these are just episodic events in life. We should see the poor performance as a reminder to try harder so as to achieve a higher goal. We also have to be reasonable when working out problems with friends. This approach will lead to stronger friendships. Bear in mind the saying: "After the storm comes the calm," which has stood the test of time.      In times of vulnerability, some people search for comfort by turning to religion, while others seek support from family or friends. In the following song, we see two possible interpretations. Some listeners may interpret the song as a religious song in which someone is thanking God for revelation and enlightenment when in despair. Other listeners think the song is about someone showing gratitude for inspiration from someone significant. Whichever interpretation we make, the lyrics convey that we can find a silver lining and obtain the uplifting power as long as we have a positive attitude. You Rasie Me Up      When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary; When troubles come and my heart burdened be; Then, I am still and wait here in the silence, Until you come and sit awhile with me.       You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains; You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas; I am strong, when I am on your shoulders; You raise me up ... To more than I can be.       You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains; You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas; I am strong, when I am on your shoulders; You raise me up ... To more than I can be.      There is no life-- no life without its hunger; Each restless heart beats so imperfectly; But when you come and I am filled with wonder, Sometimes, I think I glimpse eternity. °@°@°@You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains; You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas; I am strong, when I am on your shoulders; You raise me up ... To more than I can be. °@°@°@You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains; You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas; I am strong, when I am on your shoulders; You raise me up ... To more than I can be. °@°@°@ 
Three Days to See.      I have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days at some time during his early adult life. Darkness would make him more appreciative of sight; silence would teach him the joys of sound.       Now and then I have tested my seeing friends to discover what they see. Recently I was visited by a very good friend who had just returned from a long walk in the woods, and I asked her what she had observed. °ßNothing in particular,°® she replied. °@°@How was it possible, I asked myself, to walk for an hour through the woods and see  nothing worthy of note? I, who cannot see, find hundreds of things to interest me through mere touch. I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf. I pass my hands lovingly above the smooth skin of a silver birch. In spring, I touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud. Occasionally, if I am very fortunate, I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel the happy quiver of a bird in full song. I am delighted to have the cool waters of a brook rush through my open fingers. To me a lush carpet of pine needles or spongy grass is more welcome than the most luxurious Persian rug. °@°@Perhaps I can best illustrate by imagining what I should most like to see if I, by some miracle, were granted three seeing days.  °@°@On the first day, I should want to see the people whose kindness and gentleness and companionship have made my life worth living. First I should like to gaze long upon the face of my dear teacher, Anne Sullivan, who came to me when I was a child and opened the outer world to me. I should want not merely to see the outline of her face, so that I could cherish it in my memory, but to study that face and find in it the living evidence of the sympathetic tenderness and patience with which she accomplished the difficult task of my education. I should also view the small simple things of my home. My eyes would rest respectfully on the books in raised type, for during the long night of my life they have revealed to me the deepest channels of human life. °@°@The next day I should arise with the dawn and see the thrilling miracle by which night is transformed into day. This day I should devote to a hasty glimpse of the world, past and present. Often I have visited the New York Museum of Natural History to touch with my hands many of the objects there, but I have longed to see with my eyes the condensed history of the earth°Xanimals pictured in their native environment; gigantic carcasses of dinosaurs; realistic presentations of the process of evolution in animals. The evening of my second day of sight I should spend at a theater. Even now I often attend theatrical performances of all sorts, but the action of the play must be spelled into my hand by a companion. But how I should like to see with my own eyes the fascinating figure of Hamlet! If I could see only one play, I should know how to picture in my mind the action of a hundred plays which I have read or had transferred to me through the medium of the manual alphabet. °@°@The following morning, I should again greet the dawn, anxious to discover new delights. This day I should spend in the workaday world of the present. I should hurry to one of those gigantic structures, the Empire State Building. I am sure I would not be disappointed in the panorama spread before me. I should stroll down Fifth Avenue to make a tour of the city, to slums, to factories, to parks. I should stand at a busy corner, merely looking at people, trying by sight of them to understand something of their lives. I see smiles, and I am happy. I see serious determination, and I am proud. I see suffering, and I am compassionate. °@°@My third day of sight is drawing to an end. At midnight my temporary respite from blindness would cease, and permanent night would close in on me again. But my mind would be so overcrowded with glorious memories that I should have little time for regrets. °@°@Perhaps this short outline of how I should spend three days of sight does not agree with the program you would set for yourself if you knew that you were about to be stricken blind. I am, however, sure that if you actually faced that fate you would use your eyes as never before. Everything you saw would become dear to you, and a new world of beauty would open itself before you.  °@°@I, who am blind, can give one hint to those who see: use your eyes as if tomorrow you would be stricken blind. And the same method can be applied to other senses. Hear the music of voices and the song of a bird as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow. Touch each object you want to touch as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail. Smell the perfume of flowers, taste each morsel, as if tomorrow you could never smell and taste again. Make the most of every sense, but of all the senses, I am sure that sight must be the most delightful. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄYou are on the Titanic II. It has just hit an iceberg2 and is sinking2. And, just like last time, there are not enough lifeboats3. The captain shouts,  ‚ÄúWomen and children first!‚Äù But this time, another voice is heard, ‚ÄúWhy women?‚Äù „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhy, indeed? Part of the charm of the worldwide3 successful movie Titanic is the period4 costume4, period beauty, and period class5 difference. An audience can enjoy these at a distance. Oddly, however, of all the period customs6 in the movie, the old tradition of ‚Äúwomen and children first‚Äù enjoys total acceptance by modern audiences. In the theater, just listen to the criticism from the audience of those who try to leave withÔºçor ahead of‚îÄthe ladies. „ÄÄ„ÄÄBut isn‚Äôt grouping7 women with children an outdated5 practice? Shouldn‚Äôt any modern person, let alone feminists6, object8 to it as disrespectful to women? Yet it is as common today as it was in 1912. Consider these examples taken from recent newspapers:  Mexico :„ÄÄ‚ÄúSoldiers shot down the people, most of them women and children....‚Äù  Burundi :„ÄÄ‚ÄúAs many as 200 people, most of them women and children, were killed....‚Äù  Croatia :„ÄÄ‚ÄúThe former president was charged9 for the killing in which 103 Muslims10, including 33 women and children, were killed....‚Äù  „ÄÄ„ÄÄAt a time when women fly fighter planes, how can one not frown when adult women are normally classed5 with children? In the given example of Croatia, it seems, 70 adult men were killed. Adult women? Not clear. When things get serious, when blood starts to flow or when ships start to sink,  you‚Äôll find them with children. „ÄÄ„ÄÄNow, children should get special consideration for two reasons: they are helpless and innocent10. In an emergency11, it is our responsibility12 to save them first because they are helpless and put their lives in our hands. And in wartime, they must be kept safe because they  could have threatened or offended no one. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúWomen and children‚Äù assumes that women are as dependent on others as five-year-olds. Such an attitude made sense perhaps at a time when women were not allowed to vote13. Given the disabilities14 associated with women in 1912, it was only fair and right that a new standard of gender equality15 not suddenly be set just as lifeboat seats were being handed out. That respect‚îÄsuch as giving up your seat on the bus to a woman‚îÄmade up for the legal and social limitations placed on women at the time. „ÄÄ„ÄÄBut today, when women are treated equally in education, in employment16, in government, in athletics17, and in citizenship, what reduces them to the status18 of children? „ÄÄ„ÄÄ It is commonly thought that ladies-to-the-lifeboats is an instinct19 that developed to continue the species: women are  child bearers11. You can continue the species if the women survive and only a few of the men, but not if the men survive  and only a few of the women. Women are more precious,  biologically speaking, than men. They deserve the kind of life-protecting12 respect  we give to that other seed of the future, kids. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe problem with this kind of logic, however, is its sad way of diminishing20 that role. It strengthens an old concept21 that a chicken is just an egg‚Äôs way of making another egg. „ÄÄ„ÄÄBut humans are more than just egg layers. And polite traditions are more than just survival strategies22. So why do we say ‚Äúwomen and children‚Äù? Perhaps it‚Äôs really ‚Äúwomen for children.‚Äù The most basic tie between parents and children is maternal13. Women can raise children in ways that men cannot. And thus, because we value children‚îÄwho would deny23 them first seats at the lifeboats‚îÄwomen should go second. The children need them. „ÄÄ„ÄÄ But this explanation gets you only so far. What if there are no children on board? You are on the Titanic III, a singles cruise. No kids, no moms, no dads. Now: Iceberg! Lifeboats! Action! „ÄÄ„ÄÄHere‚Äôs my scenario14. The men, out of irrational15 bravery, should let the women go first. And the women, out of feminist self-respect24, should refuse. Result? Stalemate16. How does this movie end? How should it end? Hurry, the ship‚Äôs going down. 
Ôªø„ÄÄ„ÄÄIn the pitch blackness3 before dawn1, four boats leave a port2 in southwest4 Spain to start a complex trap3in the ocean. About 50 fishermen4 drop hundreds of red markers5, attached to nets, forming rows5 as neat6 as traffic lanes7 on a highway8. Then they move their boats to form a wide square, and they wait. As the sun rises an hour later, a drama9 begins. Nearly 200 huge tuna swim through the lanes until they find themselves trapped3 in a net that the fishermen have connected between their boats. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe tuna toss about wildly in desperate search of escape, but the captains have already formed their boats into a far tighter square, closing all exits. One by one, the exhausted10 fish die. The fishermen cry out in delight.  ‚ÄúThis is our best day this year,‚Äù says one. „ÄÄ„ÄÄBut the joy of the fishermen may not last.  Their life has become far more uncertain11 in the  Mediterranean1 area since they have to struggle to  compete against international companies. Such a  global scramble12 for bluefin6 tuna and the world‚Äôs  changing eating habits are threatening the sea‚Äôs stock13 of the  species.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ Nowadays, much of the Mediterranean‚Äôs tuna is no longer caught by traditional means. High-tech7 ‚Äútuna ranches14‚Äù‚Äîfish farms made of circular15 floating cages16 about 50 meters in diameter17 and 50 meters deep, set up 2-3 km from shore‚îÄbegan appearing in the Mediterranean in the late ‚Äò90s. The ranches are most often controlled not by small European operators but by large multinational8 corporations18. In the cages, tuna get fat on smaller fish, often for months at a time, before they are slaughtered9 and shipped off to Japan‚îÄthe market for nearly 80% of the Mediterranean bluefin catch. „ÄÄ„ÄÄTo fight the tuna ranches, the traditional fishermen need to stop the fish long before they reach the Mediterranean‚Äôs open water. Their contest against the industrial ranches has become so fierce during the past few years that some marine19 biologists and environmental activists20 fear the Mediterranean bluefin might not survive. The amount of tuna caught in the Mediterranean has soared21 in just a few years. Indeed, it tripled22 between the summer of 2002 and late in 2006, according to a report. „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF)10 is sure that people are fishing the Mediterranean‚Äôs stock into extinction23 . With fish, too much harvesting can drive down prices until suddenly there are no more. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like in a war,‚Äù says a researcher for the WWF. ‚ÄúYou can kill a million people the first year, 2 million the next year, 20 million people the year after that. Eventually you will end the war because there will be no more people to be killed.‚Äù  „ÄÄ„ÄÄEnvironmentalists urge24 that the rules on tuna fishing be tightened25. Some environmental groups and the U.S. will be trying to crack down on overfishing11. Overfishing threatens not only fish stocks in the Mediterranean but traditional fishing communities as well. Hundreds of thousands of people around the Mediterranean make their living from the sea, and the European Union (E.U.)12 officials believe a sudden lack of fish would affect many towns and villages. At the same time, the E.U. is trying to save fish by trying to convince fishermen to change their profession. E.U. funds currently help fishermen retire26 at 55 and pay to train them for new jobs in tourism. „ÄÄ„ÄÄCurrently, in many small towns, there is a sense of a way of life passing away‚îÄoften replaced by an easier, more profitable27 modern life. In many fishing towns, old men fish; their sons do not. ‚ÄúThere are other choices now,‚Äù says a fisherman. For fishermen, perhaps. But for the tuna? 
Ôªø FACTS: „ÄÄ„ÄÄTwo girls, Saree1 and Basimah2, both immigrated1 to the United States from an Arabic3 country and entered the same school, North Sea Crest Academy4. They soon became good friends. The girls spoke to each other in their native language, Arabic3, to help themselves feel at home and to remember their heritage. The two girls‚Äô behavior caused some trouble, and the principal2 decided to suspend3 them. Therefore, the families of the two girls filed a lawsuit4 against North Sea Crest Academy for violation5 of their daughters‚Äô rights of free speech. THE ISSUE: „ÄÄ„ÄÄDid North Sea Crest Academy, a public school, violate5 the rights of free speech by not allowing Saree and Basimah to speak Arabic at school? „ÄÄ„ÄÄI am a new student at North Sea Crest Academy. My family immigrated to this country this summer. I have only been here for a very short period of time. My English is not that good so I was very happy to meet Basimah, a girl at my age who also speaks Arabic. It is such a comfort to be with Basimah and I know she feels the same. When we speak Arabic at school, many of the other students give us unfriendly8 stares and no one has tried to make friends with us. In fact, some students, such as Sarah, even have taken things further. They will do things like pushing us in the halls, making our books fall, and saying very mean9 things to us about our heritage.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen Basimah and I complained to the principal, Ms. Blake, about these things happening to us, she told us not to speak Arabic at school. It was as if we were the problem. We both told our parents and they agreed that we should continue to speak Arabic at school. A week later, Basimah and I were speaking to each other in Arabic in the school cafeteria10 when Sarah began screaming horrible things at us and encouraging other students to join in. I was so afraid. So was Basimah. Two teachers rushed us out of the cafeteria to Ms. Blake‚Äôs office. After hearing what had happened, Ms. Blake suspended Basimah and me from school.  Testimony of Samma  „ÄÄ„ÄÄ My name is Samma and I am the mother of Saree. Our family has just come to America and we are so happy to be here. Recently my daughter has been very upset. She told me how she has been bullied and harassed by a few girls in her class. I asked my daughter why it  happened, and she told me it is because she speaks Arabic at school. She said she has tried to seek help from the principal, Ms. Blake, but the only solution is to stop speaking Arabic. I told my girl no one has the right to stop her from speaking Arabic and that she needn‚Äôt care what others think about it.  „ÄÄ„ÄÄAfter a few days, I was told by the principal that my girl was suspended from the Academy because she insisted on speaking Arabic with her friend. I asked an attorney11, and I was told that my girl could not be stopped from speaking Arabic at school. Therefore, I am here to struggle for my daughter's rights. Testimony of Emma Blake  „ÄÄ„ÄÄI am the principal at North Sea Crest Academy. I am in charge of the safety and well-being of the students. I was the principal of the school when September 11 occurred. Like the rest of America, our community was in shock. Our school was especially affected by the terrible event as many of the children had parents working in New York City and a few students even lost family members. We held many counseling sessions12 and also  educated the children about the threat of terrorism13. The  whole country became aware of terrorism. Here in  New Jersey, every radio station and every television  channel talked about being alert14 and reporting  suspicious15 activities.    INSTRUCTIONS: „ÄÄ„ÄÄThe plaintiffs must prove  that the school violated their  rights of free speech by not  allowing them to speak their native  language while at school and then  suspending the students when they did  speak in Arabic.  SUB-ISSUES11: 1.	Did the girls have a right to expect their speech to be protected by the school?  2.	Once the girls disobeyed20 their principal, was it proper21 to suspend the girls from school?  3.	Given the climate22 in New Jersey after 911, was it reasonable for Sarah to expect the school to protect them and put an end to Saree‚Äôs and Basimah‚Äôs ‚Äúsecret speech‚Äù?  4.	Did Principal Emma Blake act properly21 on behalf of the school?  5.	Should the girls be allowed to return to school and speak Arabic? 
Unit 6  Made in Taiwan, Made to Last. 	When people watch Hollywood movies from the nineties, many may discover that Taiwan seemed to be the only country to be taken to task for its flaws. At that time, some people believed that products made in other countries were better than any product that was made in Taiwan. °ßComponents. American components, Russian components, all made in Taiwan!°® rails an astronaut in the disaster movie Armageddon, when he detects something wrong with the spaceship he is on. Even politics in Taiwan was made fun of in the film The Cat in the Hat°Xa child watches legislators coming to blows on TV as a form of juvenile entertainment and asks, °ßTaiwan?°® From these examples, it is clear that Taiwan didn°¶t project a positive image around the world. 	To enhance its international image, Taiwan has two options. One is to implement °ßhard power,°® the practice of obtaining power through military force or economic coercion. The other is to turn to °ßsoft power.°® Coined by a Harvard professor, Joseph Nye, the term °ßsoft power°® refers to the ability to get what one wants through attraction rather than through coercion. Countries that demonstrate soft power actively engage in foreign assistance during natural disasters, strongly promote civic participation, and energetically stimulate economic development. According to Nye, soft power is ultimately a more effective way than hard power for a country to improve its image. 	For the last few years, Taiwan has put considerable effort into using soft power and has gradually gained a good reputation in many countries. For example, the Tzu Chi Foundation has received compliments from around the world for giving emergency assistance to other nations that are suffering from natural disasters. In addition, for her outstanding civic participation, the vegetable vendor Chen Shu-chu was selected as one of Time magazine°¶s one hundred most influential people in 2010 for generously donating so much of her modest income. Furthermore, the question °ßWho°¶s Lu?°® made the headlines around the world, as Lu Yen-hsun defeated his competitors to become the first Asian tennis player to have reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon since 1995. As for food, awarded a Michelin star and once ranked by The New York Times as one of the top ten restaurants in the world, the well-known Taiwanese restaurant Din Tai Fung has put Taiwan on the international food map with its delicious cuisine. When it comes to technology and economic development, Taiwan°¶s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) has won many highly respected R&D 100 Awards, which honor the hundred most innovative products in the world. Finally, the Greenwalking, an animated crosswalk signal for pedestrians, was invented in Taiwan and has been used in several developed countries, such as Germany, Japan, and the United States. Apparently, the phrase °ßMade in Taiwan°® has now shot to fame and started to shine in every corner of the globe. 	Aside from the examples above, there are still numerous superb figures and creations from Taiwan, and all of them have contributed substantially to boosting Taiwan°¶s image. Because of the hard work of many creative people, competitive Taiwanese companies, and open-handed organizations, Taiwan is now on the list of the world°¶s most powerful countries. Moreover, some of Taiwan°¶s products have become so superior that they are brought to the notice of many other countries. As for the people of Taiwan, they should be immensely proud of the progress that they have made and their ability to create a better tomorrow. °XBy Junita Bognanni
Unit 7  The Cellist of Sarajevo. 	As a pianist, I was invited to perform with a cellist at the International Cello Festival in Manchester, England. The performance on that opening night consisted of works for unaccompanied cello. On the stage was a solitary chair. There was no piano, music stand, or conductor°¶s podium. The world-famous cellist Yo-Yo Ma was one of the performers that night, and there was a moving story behind the musical composition that he was to play. 	On May 27, 1992, in Sarajevo, one of the few bakeries that still had a supply of flour was making and distributing bread to the starving people in this war-torn city. By 4 p.m., a long line had already formed and reached the street outside the bakery. Suddenly, a mortar shell fell directly into the middle of the line, and twenty-two people were killed. Flesh, blood, bone, and rubble splattered over the street. 	Not far away lived a distinguished cellist named Vedran Smailovic. No sooner had he seen the massacre outside his window than the immense amount of suffering overwhelmed him. As a result, he resolved to do one thing he did best°Xmake music. 	For each of the next twenty-two days, at 4 p.m., Smailovic put on his full, formal concert attire, picked up his cello, and walked out of his apartment into the midst of the battle raging around him. Placing a plastic chair beside the crater that the shell had made, he played one of the most mournful and haunting pieces in his repertoire. He played to the abandoned streets, smashed trucks, and burning buildings, and to the terrified people who hid themselves in the cellars while the bombs dropped and the bullets flew. With masonry exploding around him, he courageously fought for human dignity, for those who had been lost to war, for civilization, for compassion, and for peace. Though the shelling went on, he was never hurt. 	After newspapers picked up the story of this extraordinary man, an English composer named David Wilde was so moved that he wrote a composition for unaccompanied cello entitled °ßThe Cellist of Sarajevo,°® into which he poured his feelings of outrage, love, and brotherhood with Vedran Smailovic. It was this very piece, °ßThe Cellist of Sarajevo,°® that Yo-Yo Ma was about to play that evening. 	Ma came out on stage, bowed to the audience, and sat down quietly on a chair. The music began, stealing into the hushed hall and creating a shadowy, empty universe. Slowly the music grew into an agonized, screaming, and slashing furor, gripping us all before subsiding into a hollow death rattle and, eventually, back to silence. 	When Ma had finished, he remained bent over his cello, with his bow resting on the strings. No one in the hall moved or made a sound. It was as though we had just witnessed that horrifying massacre ourselves. Finally, Ma stood up, looked across the audience and stretched out his hand, inviting someone to come to the stage. An indescribable feeling swept over us as we realized who it was: Vedran Smailovic, the cellist of Sarajevo. 	Smailovic rose from his seat and walked down the aisle, and Ma left the stage to meet him. They threw their arms around each other in an embrace. Everyone in the hall erupted in chaotic, emotional excitement°Xclapping, shouting, and cheering. These two men hugged and cried unashamedly: Yo-Yo Ma, an elegant cellist of classical music, flawless in appearance and performance, and Vedran Smailovic, dressed in a stained, tattered leather motorcycle jacket. His wild, long hair, a huge beard, and mustache framed a face that looked old beyond his years, soaked with tears and lined with pain. We were all stripped down to our deepest humanity at encountering this man, who had shaken his cello like a fist in the face of bombs, ruins, and death. Without a doubt, his cello was the mightiest weapon of all. 	Now that the story behind the composition shows us the power of music, we should value this gift we all share equally. Whether we create it or simply listen to it, it°¶s a gift that can soothe, inspire, and unite us, especially when we need it most°Xand expect it least. °XAdapted from °ßThe Cellist of Sarajevo.°®

This information was posted by a Canadian7, using American technology, and you°¶re probably reading this on your computer which uses Taiwanese8 chips2 and a Korean monitor3, assembled4 by workers in a Singapore factory, transported by Indian drivers to you. °@°@That, my friends, is globalization! °@°@This scenario vividly5 describes globalization, one of the most widely used terms at the end of the 20th century. However, more and more scholars have started to question the accepted benefits of the system as it has affected the world. °@°@Many people regard globalization as a process of market integration6. This process enables7 individuals8, corporations, or nations to reach the world farther, faster, deeper, and even cheaper than before. In contrast, some scholars view globalization as a deliberate9 project that subjects nations and individuals to more powerful market forces, which are not always positive. This very basic difference in perspective shows just how significant the debate over globalization is to countries all over the world. °@°@Globalization used to be widely celebrated as the birth of freedom for peoples all over the world. It was seen as a positive force creating better connections in a more open world. Barriers11 to trade were broken down and tensions among regions12 were resolved. Many leaders, especially those in the West, supported the beginning of a new world order through free trade and political cooperation. By the late 1990s, however, the feelings were no longer the same as before. The term globalization was used increasingly to express concern about the results of global change on the well-being of various groups, the identity of nations, and the health of the environment. Politicians in various countries came to oppose America°¶s global influence brought by global capitalism as it dominated markets economically, culturally, and socially. Globalization has thus become an issue of a heated13 global debate.  °@°@A standard complaint about globalization is that cultural diversity14 is disappearing because interaction15 and integration diminish differences. Gradually, a so-called °ßglobal norm16°® comes into existence and replaces the original17 local color. For example, the United States is building a cultural empire18 with the global extension of American symbols and popular culture. On the other hand, it can be argued that new diversity can result from globalization because interaction is likely to lead to new forms of culture and integration is likely to remind19 people of the value of their own traditions. Global norms are interpreted differently according to local sensibilities20, and one such norm stresses the value of cultural difference itself. According to this line of thought, America has no total control of the rest of the world and other nations do not necessarily need to buy whatever it sells. °@°@According to one argument, globalization slows down the development of individual nations°¶ enterprise systems: free trade limits a nation°¶s ability to set policy to protect local companies. Fewer and fewer nations can resist21 the power of global norms. However, some suggest that in a more integrated6 world, a nation may even become more important because it can have a special role in creating conditions for growth22 and compensating for the effects of economic competition. They are key players in organizations and treaties23 that address global problems. °@°@Scholars have different views on the pros and cons of globalization. While whether we should welcome or dread globalization is a debatable24 topic, one thing for certain is that we are all part of this global phenomenon and deeply affected by it.
